Wonderful. Okay. Jake Flomenberg, thank you so much for being on my show 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? Good. How are you? Great. Where are you calling from right now? I'm calling from sunny Menlo Park. Wonderful. So, we're very very close by neighbors but with this covid situation, it doesn't matter if we're two miles apart or a thousand miles apart. So either way, thank you for being here. Very brief overview and then we're gonna spend we're gonna do a deep dive into your experiences. So, you did UPenn and then Harvard MBA. Went on to working with the founders of Cloudera as I think the first business hire. And then running the Splunk UI product, which I've used extensively, back in my years of engineering in the IDF, and now moved on to being a venture capital partner at Accel Ventures and Wing VC. Did I get that somewhat right? Roughly correct. Wonderful. Jake, I still can't do enough service to the incredible background that you have. I'd love for you to tell me a little bit more about yourself. And then I'd really love to pick your brain on these experiences moving from engineering, working with incredible startups early on, like Cloudera and Splunk and then making that smooth transition into venture capital and some of your insight into your investment thesis and how you approach different opportunities. Sure. So, why don't I give you sort of a quick rundown on my background and a few of the transition points I went through. So first, I actually did my undergrad at Duke. I did sort of hardware, software and engineering, and said to myself, "Hey, how can I try to solve problems in the real world?" And found Lockheed Martin and had a lot of fun there for a few years, had a lot of impact but it was also a conservative culture where it's hard for a 21 year old to take on increasing amounts of responsibility. So, I went to business school to retool, and this was in 2008. And I, sort of, came upon two trends I was interested in: cloud and data In cloud, it was the early days of things like Amazon Web Services but they were a thing at that point. And I said, "You have to be a big company to play in this game." And data. And the more I looked at this field of big data, the more I realized, "Hey, I think I know a thing or two about this topic" I feel just from reading the trade rags, like I could be useful here. Yeah. So, when summer came around, I just found every single big data company I could. And one of them was called Cloudera. They had about 12 employees. Oh my God. And I called them up and said, "Hey, can I help?" Literally I called the CEO, Mike, and I spoke to all the founders. I spoke to the CTO Amr and I think he actually thought I was interviewing for a software engineering job in the beginning. And so, I never had the heart to ask him how that interview went. I think it was pretty poor. Anyway, so they said "Hey, come help." And it was just, there were just engineers. And so, as we thought about some of the initial product roadmaps or business packagings and things like that, I gotta play a really fun role in that. It was a lot of fun. But at the same time, it was sort of deeply deep technology for technologists. And I said to myself, as I was leaving business school, "Hey, how do we help mere mortals get some value out of data?" It's great to help people that can write lots of code, but how do we help less technologically savvy people benefit from these systems? And I found Splunk, and I said, "Wow" Splunk is sort of this vertically integrated big data application. They didn't call themselves that, but that's in effect, what they were. They were serving mostly assistant ... or IT people. Still deep, but maybe not quite as deep. And I saw, I had a vision. I saw the ability for them to use this platform to service even less technically sophisticated people over time. So, I joined Splunk. And I was there for a couple years right up to their IPO and looked after pretty much anything you could touch. And then, right around that time, when Splunk was getting ready to go public, I joke that the VCs were typing into their LinkedIn search box, "MBA plus big data." And I was one of the four hits. In 2012, there were only four hits and so a large number of people reached out. And I decided to make the move over to Excel where I had known some of the guys I had met them through sitting in on a board meeting at Cloudera. And focused a lot on data and analytics. And so, that depth of sort of knowledge and firsthand experience really enabled me to focus on a domain or focus area, which is what I did when I started at Excel. I was there for about six years and then I came over to Wing. And at Wing, our focus is really trying to just build help entrepreneurs on that journey from zero to product market fit and beyond. And so, almost putting on my product manager hat and saying, "Hey, I wanna do one thing really well." There's lots of ways as investors to make money with consumer funds and growth funds, and China and India strategies, but let's build a product, us as a VC firm, around one thing, which is helping enterprise B2B entrepreneurs on that initial journey. Wow. Okay. I don't even know where to begin. I wanna go back to Cloudera and Splunk because those two are incredible incredible companies, Really, innovators in a field that I'm very passionate about. And Splunk, what was it like going into a company that has product market fit with a certain demographic? So, right. Sysadmins and people who are still, they might not be necessarily the engineers at the company, but they're very tech savvy. Today, Splunk services any person who's able to just to look at graphs and just connect the dots. Right And so, so what is that like coming into company and thinking of this vision and seeing a product that right now serves a certain demographic but trying to extrapolate it onto a larger market? Yeah. I can't take too much credit here but I can certainly describe the thought process going on at the broader company. And it's roughly as follows: People initially at the time, they actually bought Splunk for an IT use case. Today, if you look at their financials, you might see it's actually a little bit more slanted to security in many cases. But back then, it was it was mostly IT. And you would help people get to this, what we called an "Aha moment". They'd find some sort of magical value and if you're deeply technical, it's a super graph we're graphing across all the different boxes. We're finding that logline we need to solve our problem. And if you could do that a hundred times faster in Splunk then logging on to each box, you're very happy. And most people actually did that with the free product, with a free trial or a free download. And so they were very excited by the time a salesperson actually contacted them say to like, you know "You wanna pay for this." Is that generally the case that So obviously this idea of the freemium model is that you try to get your users to an aha moment as they're just risk free taking a stab at the software. And then when the salesperson comes around, it's easy. But that sounds like something very difficult to do, right? For any company? Look, one, I think Splunk was one of the pioneers in the true enterprise space that sort of easy use, quick value is something that's now become the norm, the consumerization of enterprise. That wasn't the tagline back when Splunk got started. And they made a bunch of very thoughtful product and pricing decisions, but they also, they had a great market. They just had this opportunity where you could make in the moment of truth when the pager goes off, you could help someone. If you're building a payroll system, you can delight them but you can't make them say, "Aha." in quite the same way for the most part, right It just sort of depends what space you're in and so you help them solve an acute problem in a moment of need. And off the back of that, you were able to build a relationship. You were able to eventually have a financial transaction that happens. And then, the way to think about serving other users is really to say, "Hey, you put in X data. What if you put in 1.25x data, just 25% more data, and now you can enable use case Y" Right? And so, that's what security was, which was the clear second use case. We have to build more content for the security practitioners. Some of them are very sophisticated code and write Python and understand the Splunk search language. Others need they need charts. They need dashboards to do their job. And so, we'll build those canonical dashboards. You'll pay us for those. You'll pay us to put more data into Splunk and now we serve as the second use case. And then so on and so forth. And I think within IT and security, Splunk has done a phenomenal job and we'll continue building content to serve as many many other markets over time. So, now you're moving on to Wings VC and over there you mentioned that your focus is on helping entrepreneurs get their B2B SAS platform to that product market fit and beyond, right? From the very early stages. So, what are some of the things that you're observing as you're going through this journey? What are some of the common challenges that you're observing? Because you're really seeing entrepreneurs very very early on as they might have an MVP and they're trying to get these enterprises to buy into it. It doesn't sound very easy to me. Yeah. Well I mean So we have a tendency to work with deep technological founders who have an insight about a particular domain area and this might be core IT or it might be in the real world. I spend a lot of time looking at things like computer vision these days and I have to tell you that there's gonna be some value in core enterprise, but a lot of the value of these systems is out in the real world where you can see things and react. And some struggling, there's a lot of struggles that these entrepreneurs go through. Hiring the right people is certainly a struggle. Most people don't struggle all that much in hiring the tech talent on in the early days. But that initial business model, that initial go to market strategy, sometimes that's something that the entrepreneur has done before. Often this is a new domain or that might be completely foreign to them. And so that's an area where we really try to roll up our sleeves and not do, but help and support, right? And say, "Here's an example of a head of sales for a company in an adjacent space that's at public company scale" You're never gonna hire them, but maybe they're a great adviser. Here's an example of the marketing candidate you're gonna want in another year, right? And to try to surround them with people and sort of thought partners that they can use to continually evolve their thinking and just encouraging people to take that experimental mindset. Sometimes people treat go to market like this black box where we hire a VP of sales, spend a couple million of dollars and see what happens. And, it's two years in and a lot of money wasted before you can make any changes. So that's where the area for sure, where we most repetitively and deeply engage. It's not very common for institutional VCs to come in that early on, right? I mean, I know a lot of VCs like to join in once you have some great returns, and you have a good ARR, and you're ready to take your series A and grow. It depends. You should check out the wing.vc blog if you wanna see some pretty deep analysis by my partner Peter that really unpacks those trends. What I'd say is as follows Wing invest in three buckets: the experimental seed bucket, which is we'll call it "a two million dollar check." Maybe there's some deep technological risk. Can you even build this? Does this market even exists? We invest in this round we call the power seed which is, maybe it's a four to six million dollar financing. It takes a long time to build deep enterprise tech. And some people are marketing these things as seed extensions or seed ... which, in my humble opinion, is not great marketing. Someone says, "Oh, I've raised my seed extension." and I say, "I'm sorry for your loss." I think we could do better in branding these things. And then the classic series A, which fluctuates a bit. Sort of ramped up really high in 2019. Maybe this is that eight to $15 million check size. And Wing actually aspires to invest across this entire spectrum. Wonderful. And I think you see some large firms they sort of dabble. They'll play in this experimental seed or power seed phase. Certainly, in light of covid, we've seen some people redouble their efforts a little bit there. But you're right, a lot of people are waiting for the series A. And 82% of the series A's these days have, are post revenue. And if you look at the valuations, what are the series As? These are the series Bs from a decade ago is basically what they are. And so, this power seed phase where we have a little bit of product, we have probably, we're still pre-revenue in many cases. We've engaged with the customers meaningfully. That's an area that we feel really well equipped to play. We're happy to roll up our sleeves. We're happy to talk to those customers and figure things out. With the entrepreneur, there's some firms that will participate and engage in such a process and there's many others that will say, "Hey, let's just wait until it's obvious." Right. So, investing in deep technology, it's a different type of investment than, than going mainly off of the market and just the financials. You're actually looking sometimes at founders who are who are really, they think that they've understood their niche much better than others. And they are able to develop something that is cutting edge and that is really going to innovate on their domain. They're not just going in and trying to take a similar technology that exists and implement it into another market. How do you go even about doing proper due diligence on that? And how do you, as a venture capital firm, support entrepreneurs who are dedicated to deep technology? Because innately they're spending years of research on these things and then you have to come in and you have to determine within a matter of days or weeks whether this is something that you believe in. Yeah. The way you describe it, makes it sound hard. On the other end, I don't know how hard it is, right? So, I have enough of a technical background but I can't go toe to toe with these entrepreneurs. Maybe I can pretend for some period of time, but I can determine whether or not something is real. Whether is this BS or is this real? And then if it's real, we do the following: One, we're gonna find the foremost domain authority to help validate the elements of risk that we see in the technology. Whether that's the computer vision, or the AI, or the containers or, whatever it happens to be. And then, depending on the state of the product, we're gonna go out and talk to the customers and understand what their perception is, what it is that they have and haven't been able to validate. What it is that they may need. How it is that they're going to procure. And then we line everything up and say, "All right, here's the scorecard. Here's the risks and opportunities we see. Does this make sense and do we think that this entrepreneur is uniquely capable of navigating through this environment?" Wow. Very very cool. And it really sounds like a lot of the experiences that you've had leading up to the venture capital world have really come together to give you this balanced and well-rounded insight into the different things you're doing. Do you feel, and now I'm speaking as a young entrepreneur and a lot of my friends who are following this, they're also young engineers, young entrepreneurs, perhaps out of 8200 in Israel or perhaps out of Stanford, or MIT here in the US. And now, my question is you've had a variety of different experiences, both in engineering and then product management and business, do you think there are some experiences that were more worthy of your time than others that, because in my generation, we have to make a lot of decisions all the time. Which companies do we go to? What fields do we study? How long do I wanna be an engineer before I make my transition to product management? Just as an example, it's something that I'm grappling with and a lot of my friends are grappling with. Which experiences do you think really move the needle for you? Well look, it all depends what you wanna accomplish in your career. And I'll make two points: One, it's almost impossible to become more technical over time. Once you leave the engineering ranks, you've left the engineering ranks. Most people don't circle back, right? And so people often rush to get on with it or become a product manager or whatever that is, but for the most part, that's a one way trip. So, choose your decision path wisely and know that maybe 20, 30 years ago, people didn't really empower technical ICs, individual contributors, in the same way that they do today. And you had to become at least a manager. Right? Or your paycheck wasn't getting any bigger. And companies like Google and others have done a great job really saying, "Hey, there's a path to become a level eight or whatever it is, IC and get rewarded for it." So, like that's a viable career strategy. Actually, one of the most incredible, innovative things that I've observed in the Israeli military is this exact same idea that the Israeli military was it's known that you want to go higher, you have to become an officer and you have to grow your ranks and get your different ranks or whatever. And all of a sudden in the intelligence unit, they're saying, "Uh-ah, we actually have a new method. You don't have to be an officer. You can be a professional technologist and get paid just as much." And actually, they get paid more than the officers and they become this professional persona. Yeah, well, I mean, if you think about it, some engineers are not the most gregarious people in the world. Some of them love to manage, love to talk to people. There's others that don't. There two orthogonal skill sets. And why you would forcibly lump them together, creates suboptimal allocation of talent resources, right. 100%. So one, don't rush to become less technical. Two, I think being a CEO or being a product manager is the closest that you can get to possibly preparing yourself for a career in venture. And what I mean by that is, simply that these people sit at the intersection of business and technology. They're not just writing the code and they're not just selling it. And that ability to sit on both sides of the fence is very important in evaluating a business. I wish it was just build the right technology or the best technology, and that wins. That's decidedly not the case in the real world. So, you really need both perspectives. And I joke with product managers that venture capital is sort of like meta product management in some sense. You don't get to write any of the specs. You don't get to manage the CEOs in the same way. But at a different level, that is how I think about the space. I haven't thought about this transition and that the product management side has such a big influence on the venture capital work. And I don't believe that most venture capitalists have had much product management experience. I know some of them have. A lot of them come from financial backgrounds, right? From finance or potentially CEO. But this is something that it's very interesting to me. Well, particularly at the early stage of enterprise B2B companies, I think it's a really relevant background to have. Definitely. When you're out raising your growth capital round, it can still be interesting, but there's a lot of people that are gonna be a lot more facile with the metrics and the spreadsheets. But in that early days, having a support system, a thought partner to help navigate some of those issues on the product side I think can be immensely valuable. Hopefully, some of the entrepreneurs I work with have found that to be the case. Jake, this was so enjoyable. And time just goes by way too quickly on this show. I always joke that I wish I called it 30 minute leaders instead of 20 minute leaders. But now, I'm stuck with the name so I have to hold on to 20 minutes. But before we go, I have to ask you for three words that you would use to describe yourself. Three words that describe myself. Diligent I think I try to work hard. I'm dependable. I'm there when I'm needed - That's not something that you take for granted. Dependable. It's something You know I'm there in good times and bad times. There's a lot of stress as being an entrepreneur and you need folks that are gonna show up when you need it. You know, and also I have to go for the alliteration, so probably deep. I'm willing to go deep to really understand what it is that people are building and trying to accomplish. So, there you go. I love it. So, dependent, diligent and deep. Jake, thank you very very much. It was wonderful. I learned so much. I really appreciate you taking the time to do this. Absolutely. Thanks so much for doing it. Take care. Bye bye.
