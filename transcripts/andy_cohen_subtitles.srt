1
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,560
All right, Andy Cohen,

2
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
thank you for being on my show.

3
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,240
How are you?

4
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,760
I'm great. How are you doing, Michael?

5
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,000
I am just fine.

6
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,680
How have you been dealing

7
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,120
with this whole covid situation,

8
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,720
working from home?

9
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,760
You know, it's been great.

10
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,240
My company that I'm working for now,

11
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,080
Bill.com, we sell a cloud application

12
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,440
for paying your bills

13
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,440
when you're not in your office.

14
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,000
So, we're living by that.

15
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,800
We're 600 people all working remotely

16
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,520
and haven't missed a beat.

17
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,320
So, we're doing perfectly well,

18
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,800
and I'm getting more time with my family,

19
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,400
which is nice.

20
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,000
So, I'm doing great.

21
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,760
I love it.

22
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,360
Okay. So, just to start off.

23
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,120
SVP of sales at Bill.com,

24
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,840
a 600 person company working remotely.

25
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,280
Give me your two cents

26
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,360
on what were some of the most

27
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,960
meaningful leadership changes

28
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,280
that occurred as you transition

29
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,320
from in-office to all working from home,

30
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,160
as you're an executive

31
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,680
within a 600 person company,

32
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,400
what were some of your

33
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,680
personal challenges or changes

34
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,960
that you had to adapt to?

35
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,640
So, I run a 100 person sales team

36
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,960
with Bill.com,

37
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,760
where we really thrive off

38
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,960
each others energy,

39
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,000
we're mostly together in Palo Alto

40
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,560
in a bullpen, high five

41
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,440
and ringing the gong.

42
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,880
Having a great time when we sell at Bill's.

43
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,160
Wait, there's an actual gong?

44
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,560
Oh, of course there's a gong.

45
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,840
And so, what I was worried

46
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,360
when we got the one week notice

47
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,040
to go remote

48
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,360
is how do you keep that energy.

49
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,120
Because so much of sales is the energy.

50
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,480
And I'm just so proud and grateful

51
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,640
to the team that we've been able

52
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,520
to replicate a lot of that online.

53
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,200
Not all of it, but a lot of that.

54
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,480
So, with one week notice,

55
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,280
everybody goes home.

56
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,120
And it's people in their 20s and 30s

57
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,720
that don't at all have the best

58
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,520
work environment.

59
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,000
They were sometimes still living

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,640
with their parents,

61
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,680
or they're in crowded apartments.

62
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,200
And so, everybody's scrambled.

63
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,040
Fortunately, we're all busy

64
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,960
because Bill.com is an application

65
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,880
that small businesses

66
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,000
use to pay bills remotely.

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,600
And so, it's tailor made

68
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,720
for being a remote business.

69
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,560
So, our business has been doing well.

70
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,480
That helps.

71
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,840
But also we've every day

72
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,120
we do Zoom stand ups.

73
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,200
We've done, we do Zoom happy hours.

74
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,520
We even did a quota club dinner

75
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,720
where I sent everybody steak

76
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,440
and a bottle of wine

77
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,880
and we all have dinner together.

78
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,160
And so, we're trying to do

79
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,840
as much as we can.

80
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,800
And I think long term,

81
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,640
we all want to be back together again.

82
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,080
But for short term, we're making it work.

83
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,920
I think, that's incredible.

84
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,280
I think it's always fascinating to hear

85
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,200
how different companies

86
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,240
transition to this time,

87
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,480
especially coming in

88
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,240
from a leadership position where a lot of,

89
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,800
and I'm sure that these 100 people

90
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,000
are looking up at you and saying,

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,960
"Okay. Well, Andy, what do we do now?"

92
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,360
"How is our culture going to look like?"

93
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,200
Every person comes in with their own

94
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,840
set of deliberations and their worries.

95
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,520
But, Andy, I want to go back a little bit.

96
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,960
And you did Stanford, Kellogg,

97
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,400
transition to Deloitte,

98
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,720
to different startups, and Caring.com.

99
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,440
When I saw Caring.com

100
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,040
and your involvement with it,

101
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,720
I got so inspired.

102
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,240
I'm very passionate about the issue

103
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,160
of using technology to help those

104
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,840
that are aging.

105
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,960
I'm especially looking at my own family,

106
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,360
and it's getting more and more difficult

107
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,080
to have coherent communication

108
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,240
and to take care of them.

109
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,120
Especially as we're in a remote setting

110
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,320
where it's not ideal to just go and visit

111
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,440
and be with them all the time.

112
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Talk to me a little bit about

113
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,200
the founding and management of Caring.com

114
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,320
and where that went.

115
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,600
Yeah. And just backing up

116
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,200
a little bit, Michael,

117
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,480
my view on a business career is,

118
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,800
a lot of people, I think,

119
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,400
start their career

120
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,280
and they want to have a plan.

121
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,600
I want to do this for five years,

122
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,720
this for five years.

123
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,920
I'm going to get these skills

124
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,960
and it's going to be able to do this.

125
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,040
And I look at the business career

126
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,600
as 30% having the skills

127
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,360
and 70% reacting to opportunities.

128
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,280
I'm 56.

129
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,440
I've had a 35-year business career.

130
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,960
And it's like a whitewater rafting.

131
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,840
If you're down a river and there's rocks

132
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,760
and you're navigating,

133
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,200
you can know how to paddle the boat,

134
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,280
you can have a good boat,

135
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,080
but you don't know

136
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
what's around the corner.

137
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,520
And so, I think, if I was giving advice

138
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,280
to young people, I'd be like,

139
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,880
"Get all the skills and be prepared."

140
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,680
But you're riding down a wild river.

141
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,360
You don't know what's around the corner.

142
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,840
But when you see the smooth water,

143
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,920
you can go for it.

144
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,160
When you see the waterfall,

145
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,880
you can avoid it.

146
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,200
You just have to be prepared.

147
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,080
But it's only 30% under your control.

148
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,760
70% is going to be the river,

149
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,800
and how you react to it.

150
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,880
That's my view on business.

151
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,160
So, Caring.com

152
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,760
was one of those situations.

153
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,280
I was in the position

154
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,680
of losing both my parents at a young age.

155
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,160
My dad had a heart attack and died at 67.

156
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,800
And then my mom got lung cancer

157
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,760
shortly thereafter.

158
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,120
She was living in Chicago.

159
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,840
I was living in Silicon Valley.

160
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,200
I was in a demanding job

161
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,480
and I was flying back and forth

162
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,520
trying to help her on the weekends.

163
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,800
And it was an awful time

164
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,600
because I love my mom very much

165
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,560
and we were very close.

166
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,840
It was horrible watching her struggle.

167
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,040
And then it was also horrible,

168
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,160
I was a MBA, a smart business guy,

169
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,420
trying to help her navigate

170
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,480
the health care system,

171
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,760
trying to help her try to hire a nurse,

172
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,640
navigate Medicare, deal with end of life.

173
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,320
And I just felt so unprepared.

174
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,920
And after she passed away, it was awful.

175
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,680
I ended up taking time off

176
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,640
and talking to other people and said,

177
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,960
"Well, how did you how did you deal

178
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,240
with all this end of life stuff?"

179
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,800
When you're planning your wedding,

180
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,240
you can talk to your parents,

181
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,520
you can find all these websites.

182
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,440
When you're having a baby,

183
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,240
you can read books.

184
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,240
But when you're losing a parent,

185
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,480
it's very difficult.

186
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,440
How do you know what to do?

187
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
And everybody told me

188
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,920
that had lost a parent,

189
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,080
they had no idea what to do.

190
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,640
So, I said,

191
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,960
"Hey, there's websites

192
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
for wedding planning."

193
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,520
"There's websites for having a baby."

194
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,600
"There should be a website

195
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,840
for caring for aging parent."

196
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,160
And it's tough stuff.

197
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,400
But if you can help someone,

198
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
you're doing God's work.

199
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,640
You're helping them through probably

200
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,600
the most difficult period in their life,

201
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,680
losing a parent.

202
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,760
So, I started Caring.com with that mission.

203
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,520
And it wasn't that

204
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,720
I had this whole business plan

205
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,040
that I said,

206
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,480
"Okay. There's an aging population."

207
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,760
"There's going to be a lot of caregivers."

208
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,480
"This is going to be a big business."

209
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:52,960
It was like,

210
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,600
"Hey, I went through

211
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,320
this horrible experience

212
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,280
and I knew that I could help

213
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
people through this website."

214
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,440
And so, starting Caring.com for me

215
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
turned out to be a very

216
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,880
good business opportunity.

217
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,520
But it was also very cathartic for me

218
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,240
as a way to get over my grief.

219
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,600
And then, it also was a way to really

220
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,800
get a great team together.

221
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,680
Because what I learned is,

222
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,040
when you have a mission based company,

223
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,920
you can get great great people

224
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,760
that are there

225
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,160
because they really believe

226
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,680
in the mission.

227
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,520
And so, we had an awesome team

228
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,000
at Caring.com that I had no trouble

229
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,600
attracting the best engineers,

230
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,760
keeping the best engineers.

231
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,800
We were venture back,

232
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,160
so we were able to pay market rate.

233
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,680
But also, people really liked

234
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,920
the culture and the mission.

235
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,040
And so, that was such a wonderful period.

236
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,760
I founded it, grew it,

237
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,280
sold it after seven years

238
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,960
because I'd raised venture.

239
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,640
We need an exit.

240
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
But through that seven years

241
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,440
had very little turnover

242
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,840
and a great culture and a great fund.

243
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,800
And I'm so proud.

244
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,880
Anything I did before or after,

245
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,160
the proudest part of my career,

246
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,280
was starting a mission-based company

247
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,360
and helping.

248
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,520
We ended up getting

249
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,680
three million visitors a month.

250
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,920
People that were struggling

251
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,120
with caregiving and we were able

252
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,240
to help them make it a little easier.

253
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,760
Wow. That's incredible.

254
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,720
So, give me a little bit of insight

255
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,920
into this market right now.

256
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,360
So, you're talking about the difficulties

257
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,440
of taking care of aging parents

258
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,280
or grandparents,

259
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,520
what are the difficulties?

260
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,160
Is it the lack of information

261
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,640
that's out there?

262
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,800
The lack of resources?

263
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,960
The lack of matching with the right people

264
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,360
to help take care of them?

265
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,520
What are the biggest difficulties there

266
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,720
before you came in to Caring.com

267
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,920
and perhaps today onwards?

268
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah. So, the answer is yes.

269
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,440
It's all difficult.

270
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,720
And unlike other life events,

271
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,160
you have no one to go to for advice.

272
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,720
Because if you're,

273
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,320
let me give you the numbers.

274
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,200
So, there's roughly in the US

275
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,040
two million weddings a year.

276
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,440
And people know that you spend

277
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,720
$50,000 dollars on a wedding,

278
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,680
two million weddings.

279
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,360
There's probably three million babies

280
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,520
born a year in the US,

281
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,440
roughly spend a lot of money on a baby.

282
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,120
There's 45 million people

283
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,560
caring for an aging parent in the US.

284
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,920
And the caregiving period

285
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,280
is a five-year journey on average

286
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,400
where the parent is less independent

287
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,720
and needs the adult child to help them.

288
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,320
They're spending hundreds of thousands

289
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,400
of dollars on housing, on meals,

290
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,160
on equipment, on procedures.

291
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,600
85% of Medicare spending

292
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,280
is on the last year of life.

293
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,600
So, it's just a very expensive, difficult,

294
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,320
emotionally draining.

295
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,200
And all your other life events,

296
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,240
you go to your parents.

297
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,680
You say, "Hey, help me with my wedding."

298
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,560
"Help me with my baby."

299
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,880
You can't say,

300
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,320
"Help me care for you in your death."

301
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,200
because they don't want any help.

302
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,280
They want to be independent.

303
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,880
So, it's just super difficult

304
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,320
all of the above.

305
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,280
And so, from a business standpoint,

306
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,960
there's lots of areas where

307
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,440
I think there's opportunity

308
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,240
on helping making this easier,

309
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,440
both for the caregiver

310
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,840
as well as for the senior.

311
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,600
But a lot of it is for the caregiver.

312
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,280
How do you help them help their parents?

313
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,800
Via technology, via services.

314
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,680
And this is a worldwide issue

315
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,240
because people are living longer,

316
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,080
but they're not living

317
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,920
necessarily independently long.

318
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,920
They're living in

319
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,880
less independent conditions.

320
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,680
And now with the issues with covid,

321
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,080
and senior housing not being safe,

322
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,360
more people are going to be

323
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,640
aging in a home.

324
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,360
And so, they're going to need

325
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,680
more technology and services.

326
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,400
So, I think anyone

327
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,440
is interested in the space.

328
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,920
There's lots of opportunity.

329
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,880
And it's really nice

330
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,760
if you've got your mission

331
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,320
and there's margin.

332
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,160
As a business person,

333
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,560
you can overlap those two

334
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,840
and you don't have to get grants.

335
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,760
You can do something.

336
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,720
You can do God's work

337
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,280
and have it be a business.

338
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,040
And there's so many opportunities there.

339
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,760
That's incredible.

340
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,000
I've been passionate for so long.

341
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,640
Most recently,

342
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,560
I was at a white Y Combinator hackathon

343
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,520
where we developed an app

344
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,400
where we can install a gadget

345
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,800
on my grandmas TV.

346
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,600
And we can then,

347
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,200
through our phone click a button.

348
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,080
It calls her TV,

349
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,480
and she just has to raise her hand

350
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,040
in order to answer the call.

351
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,600
Because lack of dexterity

352
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,440
and lack of tech understanding.

353
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,080
And I became so passionate

354
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,800
about this problem where

355
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,280
just the lack of communication

356
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,680
and the barriers that are rising

357
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,160
between the new generations

358
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,200
and the older generations are so apparent.

359
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,200
That you were looking at the last years,

360
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,920
I'm looking even in the last 20 years

361
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,200
when they're healthy and fine,

362
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,600
but they are not really able

363
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,120
to communicate with the grandkids

364
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,720
and loneliness is one of the

365
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,920
greatest difficulties of that age.

366
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,160
So, and I think it's one of the most

367
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,840
underserviced markets out there.

368
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,000
And I can't wait for people or myself

369
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,840
to go and solve that.

370
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,160
So, I completely agree with you.

371
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,840
Yeah, definitely.

372
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,160
Andy, I want to take us now

373
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,320
to your now most current role.

374
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,120
So, you transitioned.

375
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,200
And what you mentioned was that,

376
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,600
so, your SVP of sales at Bill.com.

377
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,320
And that it actually started

378
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,120
that you were a customer of theirs

379
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,880
for a long time.

380
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
You loved their product

381
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,200
and you make that transition, right?

382
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,720
Yeah. So, this is where I talked about,

383
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,520
a business career I think, is a river.

384
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,480
You're just sailing along.

385
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,160
And so I sold my company, Caring.com.

386
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,400
Had a good outcome.

387
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,920
Was trying to think of what to do next.

388
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,520
And I was having lunch with my friend

389
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,080
René Lacerte, who had started

390
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,360
a company called Bill.com.

391
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,920
And I knew Bill.com well

392
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,040
because I was one of their first customers

393
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,880
and I used it at Caring.com.

394
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,640
I also was an investor in the company.

395
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,800
And, so I was having lunch with him

396
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,200
and I said,

397
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,960
"Hey, I'm not sure what I want to do next."

398
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,600
"I have this wonderful experience

399
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,920
with Caring. I had a good outcome."

400
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,280
And he said,

401
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,960
"Hey, why don't you come

402
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,040
help me at Bill.com?"

403
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,640
"We're growing the company."

404
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,600
"We want to go public."

405
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,920
"I need someone to run sales."

406
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,760
"You'd be great at that."

407
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,200
And I said,

408
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,520
I wasn't looking to go

409
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,480
be head of sales, but I liked René.

410
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,800
I like the company's good product,

411
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,400
but then let me do this for a year.

412
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,360
This could be fun.

413
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,680
And that was four years ago.

414
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,040
It's been a ton of fun.

415
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,800
We've take and we've grown

416
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,600
the company 500%.

417
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,040
We've taken it public.

418
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,120
It's been a really good outcome.

419
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,040
But I wasn't looking for that. Right.

420
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,880
That was just something

421
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,600
that came along.

422
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,560
It was a good opportunity.

423
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,880
I jumped on it.

424
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,840
It's been very good for me financially

425
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,840
and it's been fun to be part of IPO,

426
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
getting that experience.

427
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,880
But I just wasn't, that was again,

428
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,720
wasn't my plan.

429
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,120
It was like, here's a good opportunity.

430
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,280
It just worked out.

431
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,240
So, give me a few insights about sales.

432
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,800
What is it like to run sales,

433
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,720
run a 100% sales team?

434
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,360
What are some of the,

435
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,280
I'm not coming from a sales background,

436
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,480
and I was an engineer myself,

437
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,160
yet almost every single person

438
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,000
that I meet that I ask,

439
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,680
what is your number one advice for me,

440
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,320
would say any advice

441
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,440
to any young entrepreneur.

442
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,960
Learn how to sell.

443
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,560
Learn how to be a good salesman.

444
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,720
Not necessarily the bad connotation

445
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,880
of the word, but be able to communicate

446
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,800
your message effectively

447
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,720
and convince others

448
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,400
of why your idea matters.

449
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,240
So, I'd love to hear your opinion on that.

450
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,920
Yeah. When I was in business schools,

451
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,480
sales was a four letter word, right?

452
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,720
You didn't want to get into sales.

453
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,680
You wanted to be in marketing.

454
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,200
That was where

455
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
the strategic smart people

456
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,760
would be at marketing.

457
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,960
The hustlers went into sales.

458
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,240
So, when I started my career,

459
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,160
I was a marketer,

460
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,680
a product manager as VP of marketing.

461
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,640
But once when I was a VP of marketing,

462
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,960
I would help out with the sales.

463
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,600
And I was at a startup where we went

464
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,160
through seven VPs of sales.

465
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,760
And each time we fired one, the CEO said,

466
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,360
"Hey, you know the product."

467
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,800
"Can you go in and try to close the deals?"

468
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,160
I go in and close the deals.

469
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,880
And after the seventh one was fired,

470
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,120
he said,

471
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,520
"Hey, every time we fire one

472
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,680
you go in and you close the deals."

473
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,800
"Why don't you just run sales?"

474
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,280
So, I learned how to run sales that way.

475
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,520
And I realized, it was really

476
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,320
the most important function at a company.

477
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,280
Because whether your product

478
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,440
is great or not,

479
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,000
you've got to get revenue for it

480
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,400
to keep the company going.

481
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,040
And those sales skills really helped me

482
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,000
when I was a CEO.

483
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,480
Because when you're CEO,

484
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,760
it's 100% sales.

485
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,000
You're selling investors.

486
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,320
You're selling the first employees.

487
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,880
You're selling the first customers.

488
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,800
And so, that's sales skill

489
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,000
is super valuable as an entrepreneur,

490
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,280
not just because sales

491
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,400
is such an important function,

492
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,000
but also because sales,

493
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,520
you're selling as a CEO all the time.

494
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,760
And so, I was fortunate to be able

495
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,160
to be an interim VP of sales.

496
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,880
Learn how important it was,

497
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,680
and then I use that skill

498
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,840
as my own company.

499
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,200
And then, this sales job I have now

500
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,120
is actually the first pure

501
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,440
sales job I've ever had.

502
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,600
I've been a VP of marketing.

503
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,360
I've been a GM.

504
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,320
I've been a CEO.

505
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,960
But I have those skills,

506
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,520
so, I was able to do it.

507
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,480
So then, how does somebody,

508
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,440
the growing trend is that

509
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,240
more and more young entrepreneurs

510
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,960
are coming from an engineering background

511
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,520
and they're very focused

512
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,560
on the technology.

513
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,240
How does one, like myself,

514
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,320
go and actually acquire

515
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,520
these hands on skills

516
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,000
and then ability to sell?

517
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,120
It doesn't sound like there's a good class

518
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,080
I could take at Stanford

519
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,200
called "How To Sell".

520
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,640
Yeah, because no one would take the class.

521
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,280
Because they all think

522
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,800
they don't want to do it.

523
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,240
There should be that class, by the way.

524
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,760
I think it would be

525
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,080
one of the best classes at Stanford,

526
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,640
but I don't think there is one.

527
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,040
Well, I think you might have to come

528
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,080
and teach it.

529
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,800
And I would definitely take it.

530
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,840
But now, seriously, I mean,

531
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,080
I'm going through my journey,

532
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,600
And how does a young entrepreneur

533
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,440
like myself, go and practice

534
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,000
these hands on skills

535
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,360
and gets better at it?

536
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,960
Yeah. So, the nice thing about sales

537
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,640
is that if you're empathetic

538
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,440
and a good listener,

539
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,600
you can learn how to do it.

540
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,800
But if you start a company,

541
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,600
you are going to learn

542
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,080
that your job is sales.

543
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,520
So, as an entrepreneur,

544
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,640
I think going into it,

545
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,680
know that if you decide

546
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,760
to start a company,

547
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,520
your job is going to be sales.

548
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,080
The product part is easier.

549
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,800
The harder part

550
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:49,600
is the investors and the employees,

551
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,800
and the first customers.

552
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,040
Especially those first customers

553
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,240
that are just buying on the mission.

554
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,880
Because version one of your product

555
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,440
isn't going to solve their problem.

556
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,320
It's going to give them

557
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,040
a path to solving the problem.

558
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,440
And so, you really have to convince them.

559
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,320
But, you'd be surprised

560
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,520
how much selling you do in your life.

561
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,680
Do you have a girlfriend?

562
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,480
Yeah. Yeah, I have a girlfriend.

563
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,440
All right.

564
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,800
You're selling her all the time, right?

565
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,800
So, I think part of it is just learning

566
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,040
that you're selling

567
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,280
all the time anyways.

568
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,760
And the formal sales part

569
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,400
is just a title, really.

570
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,600
Because everything you do

571
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,680
in your life is sales.

572
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,800
Whether it's relationships,

573
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,600
whether it's friendships,

574
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,920
whether it's investors.

575
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,320
You are, Michael,

576
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,440
probably a very good salesman.

577
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,760
Thank you.

578
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,760
And definitely, ,I do think that,

579
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,920
growing up in the entrepreneurship world,

580
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,040
I do notice that the word,

581
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,640
the four letter word does have

582
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,560
some negative connotation.

583
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,360
But I'm definitely thinking,

584
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,200
to what were you're saying

585
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,880
and this idea that at the end,

586
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,000
selling, it's not just going

587
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,640
and trying to get people to pay money

588
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,160
for something.

589
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,840
It's this whole idea

590
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,880
of how do you get people excited

591
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,440
about something

592
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,520
that you're bringing to the table.

593
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,000
Whether it's investors or employees,

594
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,960
or, your actual product, etc.

595
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,400
But Andy, then you're running

596
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,840
an organization of 100 salespeople.

597
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,760
And one of the things

598
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,800
that I'm always curious about is,

599
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,680
in sales, it only seems like it's very,

600
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,520
the commission driven incentive.

601
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,960
Like, I want to sell so that

602
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,280
I want to show that I sold the most.

603
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,800
And that means that I'm the best.

604
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,520
How do you create a healthy culture

605
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,040
that does have these motivations,

606
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,840
but is also mission driven

607
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,880
as a part of 100 person organization?

608
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,960
Yeah, so it's fortunate as a company

609
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,760
and Rene's done a great job of Bill.com

610
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,160
creating a great mission focus.

611
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
We're helping businesses

612
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,040
operate in the cloud, right?

613
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,600
And we've always been focused on that

614
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,480
in the last six months.

615
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,400
We're super focused on it.

616
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,160
So, we're actually helping small businesses

617
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,400
manage their cash flow

618
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,160
and stay in business

619
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,240
during these crazy times.

620
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,040
So, my sales team has that same mission.

621
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,920
We're really helping small businesses.

622
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,160
And then, for motivating salespeople,

623
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,120
yeah, it's the money,

624
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,200
but it's also your career.

625
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,400
What do you want to learn,

626
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,200
how do you want to grow.

627
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,080
Do you want to maximize your income,

628
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,280
or, do you want to be

629
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,480
a VP of sales someday?

630
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,800
And so, we spent a lot of time on my team

631
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,000
helping people grow.

632
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,240
And explain to them

633
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,280
it's not just the comp.

634
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,800
It's also, how do you get

635
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,600
to the next level.

636
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,720
What skills do you learn.

637
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,000
So, we do a lot of promoting from within

638
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,040
where we'll take people

639
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,640
that are just starting their sales career

640
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,240
and get them

641
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,920
to more senior selling positions,

642
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,440
or, get them to a manager position.

643
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,680
So, a lot of it is just making sure

644
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,560
we understand what people's goals are.

645
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,760
And then helping them achieve

646
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,320
their dreams.

647
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,280
Whether it's money or

648
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,440
responsibility or sales skills.

649
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,000
So, we do a lot of that.

650
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,240
And that's how we keep

651
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,320
the team motivated.

652
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
Sure, we're also trying

653
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,080
to have competitions.

654
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,960
And every day we have a leader board,

655
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,440
stack ranked on who's on top

656
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,120
and who's not.

657
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,000
If you're in sales,

658
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
you like that competition.

659
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But also, it's helping people grow.

660
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And it's not just the money.

661
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,880
It's also your career.

662
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
[--]

663
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,640
You don't feel that

664
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,720
the competitive side of it is eating away

665
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,800
from the mission side of it,

666
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,400
or creating a hostile environment?

667
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,800
You're saying it actually,

668
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,240
it just helps you be more diligent

669
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,240
and focus more

670
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,600
on what your motivations are.

671
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,240
And your responsibility as a leader

672
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,160
of such teams is to help people navigate

673
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,520
what are their motivations

674
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,080
and how do you help them get there

675
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,680
in the easiest way possible.

676
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,400
Yeah, yeah.

677
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,440
I mean, it could be cutthroat,

678
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,040
but it doesn't have to be cutthroat.

679
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,520
Right.

680
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,800
And then back to selling.

681
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,360
A lot of selling

682
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,400
that people don't understand,

683
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,760
it's not telling someone.

684
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,160
It's asking them questions.

685
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,360
So, when we use an application

686
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
called Chorus where we tape

687
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,520
people sales call,

688
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,120
so that we can understand

689
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,960
help them do better, train them.

690
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,200
And the good ones, it's the customer

691
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,120
or the prospect talking more than the rep.

692
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,840
So, a good rep is asking you

693
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,480
five or six key questions

694
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,240
and then leading you to,

695
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,560
Okay, if you've answer this way,

696
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,440
you need our product

697
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
if you answers or you don't.

698
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,680
So, a good salesperson in life

699
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
or is asking the right questions,

700
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,680
finding out how to help the person

701
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,480
they're talking to,

702
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,880
and then providing a solution

703
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,600
to that problem.

704
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,960
So, selling is really helping people

705
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,200
at a fundamental level.

706
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,040
If you have a problem

707
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,000
where you're spending three people

708
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,400
to open envelopes and write checks

709
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,200
and sign checks and it's cost you

710
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,280
a lot of money,

711
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,080
we can help you save money

712
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,680
and make your process more efficient.

713
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,240
We're helping you.

714
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,760
So,  good sales is finding a problem

715
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,480
and solving it.

716
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,040
It's not convincing someone

717
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,560
to do something

718
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,040
that they shouldn't do.

719
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,520
And, obviously,

720
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,680
one of the most greatest changes

721
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,880
that covid is bringing upon us

722
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,520
is this whole nature of sales.

723
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,560
And in my mind,

724
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,520
I'm imagining a sales relationship

725
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,880
is that you go, you meet in person.

726
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,880
You may be go out for dinner,

727
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,680
you demo the product in person.

728
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,840
And as a salesperson,

729
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,520
you're able to gauge the other person's,

730
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,200
how receptive they are

731
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,160
to what you're saying.

732
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,520
Now, you have to do a lot of this

733
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,240
over Zoom.

734
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,080
And, is there differences?

735
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,280
Are there more difficulties?

736
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,320
Where are we headed

737
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,240
in terms of the whole sales cycle?

738
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,600
Yeah. So, fortunately for us,

739
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,160
we were doing it over Zoom anyways.

740
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,560
So, it wasn't really a change.

741
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,330
You're all prepared.

742
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,560
I'm probably not the best person

743
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,240
to answer that question. Yeah.

744
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,120
Definitely. But it is something I think

745
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,200
that I've been thinking about.

746
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,240
how do you take a lot

747
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,160
of the core relationships that we have

748
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,880
in our daily lives,

749
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,160
and now that you've transitioned over Zoom

750
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,640
and you want to remain receptive?

751
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,480
And actually, I have some friends

752
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,120
who are thinking about

753
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,160
how do you actually leverage the fact

754
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,960
that these conversations are over Zoom

755
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,720
so that you can get even more insight

756
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,240
into your cell cycle,

757
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,840
like what's happening, of course.

758
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,520
Well, I will tell you

759
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,280
that people have more time to talk to you.

760
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,240
We're doing outbound and people

761
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,560
are spending less time in meetings,

762
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,720
and they're more available

763
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,880
to have these conversations.

764
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,520
And they're also, I think,

765
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,640
thinking more out of the box

766
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
than they were pre-covid,

767
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,400
on are there better ways to do things.

768
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,880
So, I think, for innovative technologies

769
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,200
it's a great time.

770
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,280
I love it. I love it.

771
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,640
Andy, this was so good.

772
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,360
I learned so much.

773
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,640
I want to thank you again for your time.

774
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,280
Before we leave,

775
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,760
I want to ask you for three words

776
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,640
that you would use to describe yourself.

777
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,600
Yeah. So, I mean, you have to ask my wife

778
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,080
for the truth.

779
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,680
But I'll tell you what I think of myself.

780
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,480
So, I think determined.

781
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,120
I think it's all about persistence.

782
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,880
Life is 99% persistence.

783
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,760
So, I am persistent.

784
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,320
I'm also optimistic.

785
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,240
Because I think,

786
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,120
in business you have to be.

787
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,120
There's everything is always broken

788
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,040
and nothing is ever perfect.

789
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,520
And so, you have to be optimistic.

790
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,280
So, I think persistent and optimistic.

791
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,560
And then, the other thing is,

792
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,600
I'm just at this point,

793
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,360
I would say that I'm focused

794
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,040
on non-work as well

795
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,400
and just having a balanced life.

796
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,440
So, I think persistent, optimistic,

797
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,320
and just focused on balance too,

798
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,400
which is your energy to do the work.

799
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,600
My high school principal was always saying,

800
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,000
balance balance balance.

801
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,040
By the time we graduated,

802
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
we all knew that phrase

803
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,520
like in the back of our hands.

804
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,840
And, we're talking about balance

805
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,040
also involved with J-Ventures,

806
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,640
an early stage investing and then helping

807
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,040
other young companies grow up.

808
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,160
So, and we didn't even

809
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,880
get to talk about that.

810
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,560
But I love this idea.

811
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,000
And I learned so much.

812
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,080
So, thank you again, Andy.

813
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,720
This is really fantastic.

814
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,520
Michael, thank you.

815
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,320
Pleasure to meet you.

816
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,040
And hopefully our paths will cross again

817
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,080
in person someday.

818
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,360
Because that is still important.

819
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,560
100%.

820
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,080
Thank you, Andy. Toda raba.

821
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,880
Take care.

822
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,520
Bye bye.

823
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:06,760
Bye.
