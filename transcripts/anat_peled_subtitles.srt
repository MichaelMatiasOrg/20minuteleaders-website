1
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:08,632
Anat Peled, thank you so much for joining

2
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:09,799
me on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,966
Thanks for having me.

4
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:11,699
It's great to be here.

5
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,999
You're actually calling

6
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,132
from Stanford Campus,

7
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:15,599
you're at the Hillel Building. Right?

8
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,499
I am. I am. There's lots of pulley books

9
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,332
behind me so.

10
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,466
Wonderful. And actually, so the reason

11
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:22,966
that you're still in campus is because

12
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:25,666
you're finishing your senior year.

13
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:28,366
You recently finish your Senior Thesis.

14
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:29,099
Your honor's thesis.

15
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,766
You actually won an award.

16
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:32,532
What was it? The Kennedy Award?

17
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:36,532
It's an award for the best Jewish studies.

18
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:39,266
Like the best thesis on the Jewish topic.

19
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:41,099
It's called the Donald and Robin Kennedy

20
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,232
Undergraduate Award, so.

21
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:46,032
Insane. So, we're gonna have to talk

22
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:46,799
a little bit about what that is.

23
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,866
But your journey is so fascinating.

24
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:50,266
And really the reason why I think

25
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,766
this is gonna be such a fun conversation

26
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:53,999
is because you and I come from

27
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,999
very similar backgrounds.

28
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,066
From Israel.

29
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:57,766
Very Israeli we've made a transition

30
00:05:57,767 --> 00:05:59,199
to Stanford.

31
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,032
For me it was a dream.

32
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:03,466
My whole life, I didn't know what to expect.

33
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:05,199
And I think, it's such a unique transition.

34
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,466
While I'm in technology, you're actually

35
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:10,366
more on the humanities.

36
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:12,599
And you're specifically passionate

37
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,232
about history.

38
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,166
You're a Rhode Scholar.

39
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,966
And you're going to study in Oxford

40
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:17,632
next year. Right?

41
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:18,999
Yeah. I am.

42
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,232
Unbelievable.

43
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:21,299
Hopefully it's okay with a, you know.

44
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,166
It will be on Zoom but,

45
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:25,432
Okay. So Anat, just how many people

46
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:27,099
get the Rhodes scholar a year?

47
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,399
Well, Israel it's very new.

48
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,166
So, only two people get it from Israel.

49
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,799
But yeah, it's very competitive.

50
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,466
Very very right.

51
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:38,599
So, whoever doesn’t know, I mean

52
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,232
Rhodes scholar, whoever hears that name

53
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,366
It is an academia.

54
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,399
It's like one of the biggest things

55
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,199
you can accomplish.

56
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,132
One of the biggest scholarships

57
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:45,566
you can get.

58
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:46,666
So Anat, just tell me a little bit about

59
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,432
yourself? Where do you come from?

60
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:49,866
And why are you at Stanford?

61
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,132
What are you finishing in Stanford now?

62
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:53,699
Totally. Yeah. So, I'm from Israel.

63
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,632
I'm from Ra'anana.

64
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:58,266
Yeah. I mean, yes, I grow up

65
00:06:58,267 --> 00:06:59,899
speaking Heblish, so Hebrew and English.

66
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,732
So, I'm kinda in both of those worlds.

67
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:03,399
Did high school in Israel.

68
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,266
Then went to the army.

69
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:05,966
And I've served in Intelligence.

70
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,099
in one of my time.

71
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,132
And then I worked a little bit

72
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:10,166
in a non-profit where

73
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:13,666
we brought together Muslims and Jews.

74
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,266
together through martial arts.

75
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:16,732
So that was a lot of fun.

76
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,399
Do you know martial arts yourself?

77
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,866
I don't. I was the only one.

78
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:22,432
I was the Project Manager.

79
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:24,332
Of course. Of course.

80
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,499
I was the only one there

81
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,466
who was not a black belt.

82
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:29,666
Yeah, and after that I applied to Stanford.

83
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:31,099
It was a dream of mine to get this

84
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,366
Liberal Arts Education.

85
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:34,466
Which is very different than in Israel.

86
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:36,299
Where you know, you apply years.

87
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,632
You know, you study this.

88
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:39,999
And you don’t really get a lot of

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,332
kind of exploring outside.

90
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,132
And so I came to Stanford.

91
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:44,699
Fell in love with history.

92
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,666
Yeah, and next year,

93
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,499
So, Anat before we jump to history.

94
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,332
Because you know, a lot of my friends

95
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,399
and colleagues from 8200

96
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,832
and from generally Tel Aviv in Israel,

97
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,232
They're watching this and while

98
00:07:58,233 --> 00:08:00,832
You and I had a very

99
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,066
interesting experience in Stanford.

100
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:03,699
I think that it's very different from

101
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,399
the ordinary university approach

102
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,099
that Israel has.

103
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,966
I don’t know if it's better or worse.

104
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:10,299
But it's different. And I'd love for you

105
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,999
to give me, you know, your true sense

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,032
of what was the Stanford experience

107
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:15,232
from you having gone through

108
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:16,132
four years of it now?

109
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:18,632
Yeah. So, first of all if any Israelis

110
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:19,299
who are watching this and

111
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,299
thinking about coming.

112
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,966
Totally apply.

113
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:25,466
It's really great. And it's possible.

114
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:26,966
If we did it, it's possible.

115
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:27,799
It is possible.

116
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,999
If they were willing to take me on

117
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,199
Anybody can get it, I'm telling you.

118
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,932
Yeah. So, it's just been amazing.

119
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:37,166
Because you get the opportunities here

120
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:37,832
are really,

121
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,699
You think of it, you can make it happen.

122
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,732
They have the funds.

123
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,399
They have the best professors here.

124
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,699
And as for me, I kind of studied history.

125
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,932
I love it. But it also, I study it

126
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:49,032
'cause it didn't get in the way

127
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,132
of my education.

128
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,432
I could take the best classes,

129
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:52,666
the best teachers from other department.

130
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,866
Yeah, I've done a lot of political science.

131
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:59,166
And journalism. And anthropology.

132
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:00,132
Like all kinds of stuff.

133
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,566
Was there a specific class or moment

134
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:04,632
that really, you know, that's a key

135
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:05,599
or a Stanford highlight?

136
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,366
Or is it a combination of bunch of things?

137
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:08,299
I will tell you about a crazy class

138
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,532
that I took. It's such a Stanford thing.

139
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:13,232
So, basically, it was two weeks

140
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,066
intensive seminar called,

141
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:17,032
The Face of Battle.

142
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:18,766
It was for people who finish their first year

143
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:19,966
going to their second year.

144
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,666
And I get this okay.

145
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,832
So, it was about war.

146
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,666
And so we studied two battles.

147
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,966
We got assigned a character

148
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:28,966
from each side of the battles.

149
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:29,932
So, we studied Gettysburg.

150
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:31,566
And we get assigned a confederate

151
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:33,032
in the union. And on another battle

152
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:34,699
a little big horn, so.

153
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,099
So, the American civil war, right?

154
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,232
Yeah. The first battles the Civil war?

155
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:40,632
The second one was a little bit later.

156
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:44,199
But, and then basically you plan a speech.

157
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,566
As the character.

158
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:47,499
Then you fly to the battlefield.

159
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,499
They flew us to you know,

160
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,532
to DC in Montana, and you give speeches

161
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:53,766
as the characters.

162
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:54,932
Where the battle happened.

163
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:58,132
So, I give a speech as Robert E. Lee

164
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:01,266
the Confederate General in Gettysburg.

165
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,566
Yeah, it was pretty wild.

166
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:06,332
Like John Huston. Yeah.

167
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,666
Wow. Okay. So, really summing it up.

168
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:13,066
The idea also what I feel similar to you,

169
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:15,632
I mean, the opportunities are endless.

170
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:16,932
And you get to really explore whatever

171
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:17,566
your passion is.

172
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:18,766
And while Stanford is really well known

173
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:20,632
for its computer science and mathematics

174
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,599
Here you are doing history, and saying,

175
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,766
"Yeah, I had won one of the most

176
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:24,932
incredible experiences I could have hope

177
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:25,766
for in history."

178
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:26,999
And what was your honors thesis

179
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,632
is about?

180
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:30,166
Yeah. So, my honors thesis is about

181
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:32,099
actually, Israel. It's about the Kibbutz.

182
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,132
I studied about you know,

183
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:37,166
I look into the period of the 1920s.

184
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,232
The first Kibbutz was found, okay,

185
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:40,132
So, for people who don't know

186
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:40,732
what the Kibbutz is?

187
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:41,566
Yes.

188
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:42,999
It's a one of a kind wacky idea

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,932
Basically, people say it's the

190
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,066
most successful form of

191
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:49,132
democratics socialism ever.

192
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:51,266
Ever. Like ever. It still exists today.

193
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:52,666
Not exactly the same form.

194
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:55,066
But basically all property was shared.

195
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:58,432
And it was all decisions were made

196
00:10:58,433 --> 00:10:59,432
through communal meeting

197
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:01,532
It was an agricultural settlement.

198
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:06,032
Yeah. And so, I looked at the 1920s

199
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,832
when, the first Kibbutz was found in 1910.

200
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,599
The kids started to be born in 1920s.

201
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,699
And I wanted to see what this kind of

202
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,799
fanatical socialist who came from

203
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,566
the struggle in Europe.

204
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,232
You know from this background of

205
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:20,732
Jewish kind of you know,

206
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:22,066
you're gonna grow up to be a rabbi,

207
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:23,332
the girls are mother.

208
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,932
It suddenly came and they were socialist.

209
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:27,866
And you know, with socialism

210
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:28,999
there's this idea that the

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,466
Bourgeois family, you know

212
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:32,132
the mom, the husband, the children,

213
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:36,666
its property. That’s bourgeois.

214
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:37,532
We're trying to get rid of it.

215
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:38,766
So, what do these people do?

216
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:40,932
And I studied the family in the Kibbutz.

217
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,132
And I try to see how they reimagined it.

218
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:44,832
Suddenly the kids where

219
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:45,866
everyone’s children.

220
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:47,232
They raised kids in communal homes.

221
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,899
But it was very painful process.

222
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,966
So I looked at a lot of meeting minutes.

223
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:55,166
Alef [--]

224
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:56,399
Who is a philosopher.

225
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,732
Who actually did a lot on the family.

226
00:11:58,733 --> 00:11:59,799
So, it a was a lot of fun for me

227
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,832
to rediscover the history

228
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:01,932
of my own country, and--

229
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:03,966
Did you read a lot of this in Hebrew?

230
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,266
The primary sources?

231
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,232
Its all in Hebrew. Yeah, I did some

232
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:07,499
archival research in Israel.

233
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,499
at Degania Alef. That would be so cool.

234
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,332
Yeah.

235
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,766
Wow. Okay. But Anat, one of things

236
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,532
that you mention to me right before

237
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:16,966
right before we start.

238
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,699
And I think it ties very nicely to

239
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,832
to this research that you did.

240
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,032
You said one of the reasons you think

241
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,166
you got the Rhodes scholarship

242
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:25,766
is because you told them,

243
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:27,832
"Listen. I want to be a top bidder."

244
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,032
That is sort of a life goal of yours.

245
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:30,799
What does that mean to you?

246
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,732
Because when I started this show,

247
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:34,432
I said, my pitch was,

248
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:36,366
"I wanna interview proud leaders

249
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:37,132
from around the world."

250
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:39,932
So, I very much resonate with this

251
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,099
ambition to be a tough leader.

252
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,066
That was I aspire myself.

253
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:44,732
What does it mean for you?

254
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:47,066
Yeah. I think that idea still matter. Right?

255
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,632
We're in this time where it seems like

256
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:50,699
they don't almost.

257
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,599
With all the social media.

258
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,632
Everything's fast phased.

259
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:53,932
You know, somethings happen and

260
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:54,899
you forget about it the next day.

261
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,399
And you [--].

262
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,466
But, I really believe that ideas can change

263
00:12:58,467 --> 00:12:59,766
the world and their important.

264
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,132
And they have to be accessible.

265
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:02,232
That's the thing, you know.

266
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:05,232
I want to go into academia. But I also,

267
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:06,866
I wanna make my ideas accessible.

268
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:08,066
to journalism, you know,

269
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:11,399
whatever medium it can reach people.

270
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,532
And I guess some of my,

271
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:16,332
I think that the people I look up to,

272
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,566
for example, one of my heroes is

273
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:21,232
is Hannah Arendt. So, she was this

274
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,266
philosopher who is very famous

275
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:24,999
for covering the Eichmann trial.

276
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,299
And she basically went with her truth.

277
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,399
She settle lot of things that were not

278
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,266
easy to hear.

279
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:35,199
And she suffered a lot from that.

280
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,466
She kind of went with her truth.

281
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:39,432
And she had intellectual courage.

282
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:42,532
So, i think it's basically just thinking about

283
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:45,632
how we want to live us as a society.

284
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:46,866
And I want to do that through my research.

285
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,766
Through my writing.

286
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:49,266
Through politics.

287
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:53,032
So, do you see yourself as a contrarian?

288
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,166
as a goal?

289
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,366
I mean, are you looking for different areas

290
00:13:58,367 --> 00:13:59,366
in which you can say,

291
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:00,566
"Okay. Well actually, something

292
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,066
is missing here. And I wanna do research

293
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:03,566
and I might prove that something

294
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:05,032
is different from what other people

295
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:06,499
believe or go against a crowd."

296
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,432
Or is it more general. Just research.

297
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,232
Yeah. I'm very interested in,

298
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:14,499
I guess the social contracts specifically.

299
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,966
How we live together as a society?

300
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:17,566
What's the glue that holds us together?

301
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:19,832
And as an Israeli, I'm interested in

302
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,432
you know, the Israeli context.

303
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:22,932
And I looked back to history,

304
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:25,666
to see kind of you know,

305
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:26,199
we were founded on the idea

306
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,132
about just society by these crazy teens

307
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,932
who came here and everything behind.

308
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:32,666
Not just to survive, right?

309
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:36,099
We talk a lot about existence in Israel.

310
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,299
Right? We have the holocaust.

311
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,266
We've gone through a lot.

312
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:40,199
But these young people also

313
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,666
thought about content of Jewish life

314
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:44,699
in Israel. They thought about what kind

315
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,032
of society they want us to live.

316
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:48,532
What is justice.

317
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:50,666
So I think we can gain inspiration

318
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,266
from that. So, I'm very interested in,

319
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,466
kind of a connection between history

320
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:58,532
and kind of politics and the future.

321
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:00,332
How we can build society better?

322
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,199
I wouldn't say I'm a contrarian.

323
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,432
I do think I have a critical mind.

324
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:07,166
I try to question a lot of what I hear.

325
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:11,366
Yeah. So, I guess I just like to understand

326
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:13,232
what's going on around me.

327
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:14,899
So, social contract.

328
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,399
I automatically I'm thinking about

329
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,699
society and the social contracts of today.

330
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,932
Versus you know,

331
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:20,999
when my parents grow up

332
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,699
or my grandparents who are

333
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,232
on the Kibbutz. So, you know today

334
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:26,399
Oh Kibbutz? Yeah.

335
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,499
I mean, I love our families.

336
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,032
We're on the Kibbutz right.

337
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:32,632
All of our American cousins,

338
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:34,332
live in the Kibbutz in somewhere and,

339
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:38,332
But it sounds like today's social contract

340
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,999
is very much guided by technology.

341
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,832
And by the different ways in which

342
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,599
we perceive social contracts

343
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,899
in communities. So, how do you

344
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,066
also become a part of that thinking

345
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,799
and that thought process as a historian?

346
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,366
Because you have to both understand

347
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,232
where technology is going and how

348
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:57,766
it's shaping psychologically

349
00:15:57,767 --> 00:15:59,799
our communities while looking at

350
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,266
the actual communities.

351
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:03,732
Yeah. So, I guess I have two points

352
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:05,532
on that. So, for the first thing I wanna say

353
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:06,866
about social contract is,

354
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:08,699
I'm not sure what a social contract is

355
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,932
anymore. I heard someone say,

356
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:13,499
this professor called Cornel West,

357
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,766
talking about the protest going

358
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,999
right now, Black Lives Matter.

359
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,266
While watching he said,

360
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:21,432
"The failure of a social experiment."

361
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:22,899
he thought that the social contract

362
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,032
like there was a breakdown.

363
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:26,066
I think we need, there's a lot of room

364
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:27,366
for you know political theorist

365
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:29,666
and historians to think about

366
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:31,532
what holds us together?

367
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,032
What connects us?

368
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,232
It's not just the individual.

369
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:37,099
But about the point in technology,

370
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,532
I totally agree with you.

371
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,032
The historian that got me interested

372
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,399
in all of this is Yuval Harari.

373
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,932
Okay. I don’t know if you read his stuff.

374
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:46,032
Of course. He's an Israeli historian.

375
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:47,966
He wrote this book called Homo Deus.

376
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:52,299
About technology and he kind of showed

377
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,566
you don't have to know the

378
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:54,532
needy greedy of technology.

379
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:56,532
You need to have literacy, I think.

380
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:58,666
And that's something that I'm working on.

381
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,132
I'm not the best at it.

382
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:01,866
I'm working on it, but

383
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:04,366
you don't need to know the little things.

384
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:07,366
You can critique it as a human.

385
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:09,366
Like, that's part of the role of humanities.

386
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:11,132
We keep talking about the crisis

387
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:12,099
of the humanities.

388
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,632
It felt like part of our role is

389
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,332
to talk about ethics and to ask questions.

390
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,332
And you don't have to understand

391
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,232
how to codes to do that.

392
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:22,632
A 100%. And I can spend it

393
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:23,666
the other way around and say,

394
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,966
"Well, what worries me is that, I'm a part

395
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:28,199
of the group that is developing this

396
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,399
technologies and I consider myself

397
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,666
an innovator and that I hope

398
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:32,932
to one day I build something that will

399
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:35,199
influence society and perhaps change

400
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,366
the social contract.

401
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:38,199
And hopefully improve it for the better.

402
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,999
Yet, unless I study ethics and philosophy,

403
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,232
And unless I study history.

404
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:47,532
How can I hope to be able to make

405
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,599
a positive impact with my actions,

406
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,466
if I don't know what happened before?

407
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:54,899
So, what it feels to me,

408
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,899
which is a little bit worrying is that

409
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,266
we have two different populations going.

410
00:17:58,267 --> 00:18:00,199
We have the technology population

411
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,632
that is really focused on the

412
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:02,899
artificial intelligence and prepping

413
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,799
these platforms.

414
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,332
And then you can have a clear

415
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,832
distinction to historians and

416
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,766
more humanities people who,

417
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,099
and there's not necessarily

418
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,066
a healthy communication.

419
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:12,866
Absolutely. Where is this going?

420
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:14,332
100% agree.

421
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,299
This has been a problem way back.

422
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,932
People have been thinking about this

423
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:20,099
for a long time. I think you actually see it

424
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,899
on, I mean we go to Stanford and

425
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,966
we see it on Stanford's campus

426
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:25,366
all the time. There is like,

427
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:26,199
I don't know if you know this,

428
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,532
but there's like the name of like,

429
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:29,132
the techies and the fuzzies.

430
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:30,332
The fuzzies are like,

431
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:30,999
I did not know that.

432
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,966
Yeah, it's kind like of old,

433
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:33,099
I'm not cool enough yet

434
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,399
to be in those clubs.

435
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,666
Well, I guess you're a techie.

436
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:36,932
So, you don't need to worry about it.

437
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:39,466
But, you know it's,

438
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:42,032
What's the fuzzies?

439
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:43,532
Fuzzies. Like they're not doing anything

440
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:45,266
really important. it's soft, you know.

441
00:18:45,267 --> 00:18:48,399
Yeah, and there's just this disconnect.

442
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,099
There's you go to one part of the campus

443
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,932
which is the humanities.

444
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:54,366
And one part is, the engineering quad.

445
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,866
And you do all the cool stuff there.

446
00:18:55,867 --> 00:19:00,366
And there's this feeling that that's where

447
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:01,499
the future is.

448
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,499
That's how you gonna change the world.

449
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,699
In technology.

450
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,199
But we need to bridge those things

451
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,299
in a meaningful way.

452
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,432
And not just talk about it.

453
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:10,532
And it's hard.

454
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,566
It's about rethinking our curriculum,

455
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:15,632
Yeah, and we haven't figured it out yet.

456
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:17,166
But it's definitely,

457
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:18,632
I love being a humanity student

458
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:19,999
on Stanford’s campus

459
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,766
because it's so techie.

460
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:23,399
I think about issues, you know

461
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,632
like artificial intelligence things like that.

462
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:26,466
Which I wouldn’t think about

463
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:27,866
if I was on the, I think east coast.

464
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:31,232
100%. So, Anat I mean, you don't

465
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:33,299
just study. You're writing articles for

466
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,932
a bunch of different well-known

467
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:37,699
publications and you really are starting

468
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,766
to become a proud leader.

469
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:41,099
And writing some pretty interesting stuff.

470
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,032
So, where do you see yourself going?

471
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:44,899
For I have the privilege on one hand

472
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,399
speaking to a lot of people in their

473
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,932
40s and 50s who've done a lot

474
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:50,732
and have already their world impact.

475
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:52,232
And now I get the chance to speak

476
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,466
to somebody ahead of me.

477
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:54,566
If I had to bet on anybody in the world,

478
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:55,832
I would probably bet on you.

479
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,332
That you're gonna do some crazy stuff

480
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,199
for humanity.

481
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,066
So what path do you see yourself now?

482
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,132
Going to Oxford. Rhodes scholar.

483
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:04,532
Where do you go from there?

484
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:07,266
Yeah. I mean my goal is to get my PhD.

485
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:09,466
In Oxford. Continuing history.

486
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:11,599
And then I see my future in Israel.

487
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,799
That's where my family is.

488
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,699
That's what I care about.

489
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,499
And I wanted to have one

490
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,732
kind of like rooted in Academia studying

491
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:23,766
the past but also, like kind of rooted in

492
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:26,299
writing and politics and teaching.

493
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,899
Thinking about the present and the future

494
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,999
And teaching the next generation

495
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,432
about, you know inspiring them.

496
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,599
And I think we need that. We need to,

497
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,799
Yeah. I mean I don't know what you

498
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,766
think about what is going on.

499
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:41,432
Israeli politics is madness right now.

500
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:42,532
It's crazy.

501
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,832
It was madness when you interviewed

502
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,566
Larry Diamond and Hillel back then.

503
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:47,599
And it's even more madness right now.

504
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,999
Yes it was. Yeah, we did a talk about

505
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,866
one of the Israeli elections.

506
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:54,299
One of the three or four.

507
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,132
I can't even count anymore.

508
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:56,766
You know you lose track.

509
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:58,966
Yeah. Well I see myself kind of

510
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,566
thorough thinking and scholarship

511
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,966
and writing. Hopefully, you know.

512
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:06,232
Thinking about the future.

513
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:09,566
And how we can design our society better

514
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:12,666
I love it. Are there specific questions

515
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,466
that you see yourself diving deep

516
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:16,732
into research? Or are you keeping at an

517
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,532
open mind and really understanding that

518
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:19,766
yeah, things might change a hundred

519
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:20,932
and may decrease by the time

520
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:22,499
that I'm ready to dive into them?

521
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,699
Yeah, at the moment I'm thinking of

522
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,132
continuing of my under-graduate thesis.

523
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:30,266
I'm really interested by this world of

524
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:31,832
socialist thoughts.

525
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,332
And I guess kind of European

526
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,432
intellectual history.

527
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:36,999
Just kind of this big ideas.

528
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,799
Like Marx and like Nicheli.

529
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,699
All these big ideas that really

530
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,499
permeated into different movements

531
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,266
around the world.

532
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:45,732
And you know what's crazy?

533
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:48,232
It's kind of inspiring for me because

534
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:50,966
going to high school in Israel.

535
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:53,999
We went through citizenship classes.

536
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,399
Yeah.

537
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,232
It was awful. I didn't know.

538
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:01,966
I mean looking back, I didn't know

539
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:03,032
that my country was founded by a

540
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:04,866
radical socialist. I didn't know that.

541
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:07,466
We learn about their names.

542
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:09,899
Kind of our around, all the street names.

543
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,832
David Ben-Gurion, [--]

544
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,599
Katznelson. These were leaders who

545
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,999
believed in universal values.

546
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,299
I'm not talking communist.

547
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,466
I'm talking more of a just society.

548
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:23,666
Like Kibbutz idea of living together.

549
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,332
So, we have to find inspiration in that.

550
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,332
And we have some of the coolest thinkers

551
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,132
in kind of labor scientism.

552
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:30,132
So that's what I'm thinking right now.

553
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:32,032
That's just fascinating.

554
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:35,566
Anat, what are you looking ahead now

555
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:37,166
at Oxford. What are you gonna actually

556
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:38,166
study there?

557
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:40,099
So, I'm gonna study Intellectual History.

558
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,166
I'm going I think continuing kind of on the

559
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:44,132
history of the Kibbutz.

560
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:45,766
The time the Kibbutz history,

561
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:48,199
not just to kind of Zionist

562
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,266
and Israelis studies but also to the world

563
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:52,266
of socialism and revolution.

564
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:54,799
And try to understand how the Kibbutz

565
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,332
fits into that.

566
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:58,066
And whether the Jewish experience

567
00:22:58,067 --> 00:23:00,032
in Israel-Palestine,

568
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:01,766
I mean, it was Palestina before

569
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:05,066
So, how does that fit into

570
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:08,266
other kind of movements.

571
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:09,866
Fascinating. Well after this call I,

572
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:12,166
now I understand how much I don't know

573
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:13,966
about the origins of where I came from

574
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:16,266
and the Kibbutz and radical.

575
00:23:16,267 --> 00:23:17,266
[--]

576
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:18,566
So, I'm gonna need you to send me

577
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:20,366
this honor's thesis which already won

578
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:22,032
all of the awards.

579
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,532
So that I can enjoy it myself.

580
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:24,432
Anat, before we go.

581
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:25,366
And it's just so fascinating.

582
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:26,132
Thank you for your time.

583
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:28,566
I'd love to know three words that

584
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:31,299
best describe you and I'm gonna ask you

585
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,999
the same question in about 20 years

586
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,032
after you've changed the world.

587
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:36,799
So, I'm gonna test you on how

588
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,899
consistent you are.

589
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,599
Okay. Well, I think the first one is Curious.

590
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,499
'Cause I really want to understand

591
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,866
what's going on around me.

592
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:48,332
I think then it's you know, a Thinker.

593
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,766
So, all the time I'm thinking.

594
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:54,066
And I think, Passionate.

595
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:56,566
Well, I'm really kind of

596
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:58,466
It's hard for me to do things

597
00:23:58,467 --> 00:24:00,532
that I don't enjoy and so,

598
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:01,666
when I get into a project,

599
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:04,266
am just like, I'm consumed by it.

600
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:05,966
I love it. And you know Anat,

601
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:07,399
before we leave, I do have to mention

602
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,766
that I get to speak to quite a few

603
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,766
Stanford students and Harvard students,

604
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:13,466
and Princeton and students in Israel.

605
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:16,399
It is so rare to talk to somebody

606
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,399
who is so passionate about what

607
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,199
their studying in.

608
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,132
We do know these phenomena

609
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:21,832
especially in the Ivy Leagues in the US

610
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,999
that a lot of students are pressured into

611
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,199
studying a subject because it's prestigious

612
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,666
and it's what's their parents think

613
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:29,199
or what is society is saying in school.

614
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,099
A lot of the techies unfortunately.

615
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,732
I like that. And I'd love for you

616
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:34,599
maybe just give me a you know

617
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,132
one or two sentences about

618
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:38,332
you know, we're coming in from a

619
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,499
little bit more mature background.

620
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,699
We've done the military.

621
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,532
We've command and we've been a part

622
00:24:42,533 --> 00:24:44,599
of teams and we saw some of the bigger

623
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,066
level of questions that the world is

624
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,566
dealing with. So, if there's any

625
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,432
undergraduates who are deciding

626
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:51,966
their major, or are thinking of what to do,

627
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:53,166
and they are hearing this.

628
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:54,232
What advice would you give them

629
00:24:54,233 --> 00:24:55,166
after having gone through

630
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:56,299
this experience of following

631
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,832
your passion?

632
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:58,999
Yeah. I think that you're just gonna

633
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,066
do better if you do what you love.

634
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:03,132
Don't be afraid. The world is a mess

635
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:05,899
right now. We need humanities people.

636
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,432
We need people to think about

637
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:09,499
what's going on. The social contract

638
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,899
is being torn apart all over the world.

639
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,866
I think in America, you see

640
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:17,166
a very visually, the riots and the protests.

641
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:17,966
Totally.

642
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:20,366
But don't be afraid of just following

643
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:21,499
what you love.

644
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,599
I understand the pressures.

645
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,532
And I understand those things.

646
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,899
But, I would encourage it.

647
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,899
I think the simple thing is you know,

648
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,866
just be better.

649
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:31,266
That's the bottom line.

650
00:25:31,267 --> 00:25:34,799
You'll love coming it to work, you know.

651
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,666
That's beautiful. That's beautiful.

652
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,466
Anat, toda raba.

653
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:37,932
Thank you for the time.

654
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:38,932
Thank you for the inspiration.

655
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:41,132
And best of luck with

656
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:43,232
Rhodes scholarship at Oxford.

657
00:25:43,233 --> 00:25:44,799
And then hopefully PhD

658
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,566
and change the world.

659
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:47,299
We're gonna have to do some

660
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,232
pretty frequent check-ins over here.

661
00:25:48,233 --> 00:25:50,199
Awesome.

662
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,432
Thank you so much for having me.

663
00:25:51,433 --> 00:27:43,233
Take care.
