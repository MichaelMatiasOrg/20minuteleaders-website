1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,040
Most people in Silicon Valley, you know,

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,880
they have a hammer

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,000
and everything is a nail.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,240
And that hammer is tools

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,160
and they're going to build

6
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,440
a tool for everything.

7
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,560
And the mindset is pure software,

8
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,920
AI is going to do everything,

9
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,040
humans are irrelevant.

10
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,550
Humans aren't even

11
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:16,770
going to exist in the future.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,619
Francis Pedraza,

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,826
thank you so much for joining me

14
00:00:50,827 --> 00:00:52,800
on 20 Minute Leaders.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,400
Thanks for having me, Michael.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,760
It's a pleasure to have you.

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,560
We actually met

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,240
for the first time seven years ago.

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,280
You came to speak to our summer class

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
at MIT LaunchX.

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,720
It was about Everest, which I know

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,520
that it's a long time back for you now

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,360
with all the different things

24
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,720
that you've done since then.

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,640
But thank you for being

26
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:11,720
such a source of inspiration

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,280
for us back then.

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,240
It was really fantastic.

29
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,520
Thanks for remembering

30
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,960
and for reaching out.

31
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,880
Of course. Of course.

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,640
I'm really excited to have you here.

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,546
Francis, I'm not going to do justice

34
00:01:22,547 --> 00:01:24,240
to go over the incredible bio,

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,360
because you've actually had

36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,000
a pretty incredible upbringing.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,960
A pretty global one.

38
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,240
But all sorts of diverse activities.

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,000
I would love to just spend

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the first few minutes going

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,320
a little bit over your journey.

42
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,880
Who are you?

43
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,840
What are your passions?

44
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,160
And I think that will be

45
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,400
a really good leeway into

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,320
the things you're doing today,

47
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,960
and some source of inspiration

48
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,920
for young entrepreneurs like myself.

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,960
My mother grew up in Iran

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,320
and came to United States

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,360
before the revolution.

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,880
But when the revolution happened,

53
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,800
her world changed.

54
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,480
And she had finished her undergrad

55
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,080
but she dropped out of graduate school,

56
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,360
became an entrepreneur

57
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,520
and worked really, really hard

58
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,360
to succeed and did.

59
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,520
And then when she had me,

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,360
she sold her company

61
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,120
and focused on raising me.

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,880
My father grew up around the world.

63
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,000
His father worked for Procter and Gamble

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,640
and other American companies.

65
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,480
So, he spent some time

66
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,480
growing up in places like Japan

67
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,800
and the Philippines and Venezuela.

68
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,560
And so, you know, I think

69
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,400
I got the immigrant value set,

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,080
which is a lot of hustle

71
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,680
and determination and hard work

72
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,640
and a sense of, I think, patriotism

73
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,480
for the United States.

74
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,800
This is a place where dreams can happen

75
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:44,080
and you're in a free country,

76
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,520
you have property rights, rule of law,

77
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,040
and you can build something here

78
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,560
and express your potential.

79
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,440
And that was my upbringing.

80
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,040
And my life changed,

81
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,560
I was pretty frustrated

82
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,840
in both public and private schools

83
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,760
for a variety of reasons

84
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,075
until I discovered

85
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:06,640
this incredible Internet entrepreneur

86
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,600
who is teaching

87
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,200
hundreds of students on Skype.

88
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Zoom did not exist back then.

89
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,560
But he happened to be a local.

90
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,360
And he was teaching them

91
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,720
a five year course

92
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,520
in the great books

93
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,320
of Western Civilization.

94
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,200
And the first book we studied

95
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,080
was Homer's Iliad,

96
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,040
and then the next was The Odyssey.

97
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,920
And then we went on

98
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,240
to read many of the ancient Greeks

99
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,120
and the Romans and then

100
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,400
the medieval Scholastics, Renaissance

101
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,200
and Enlightenment and Moderns

102
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,320
and a number of subjects.

103
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,000
And reading the original sources,

104
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,640
writing about them,

105
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,400
debating them, discussing them.

106
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,000
And so, I developed this passion

107
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,440
for the humanities.

108
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,880
And people asked me,

109
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,200
"How did you go from that

110
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,440
to starting a company?"

111
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:54,200
And my first company was called Everest.

112
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
You remember it.

113
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,120
It was an iPhone app

114
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,320
to help people achieve personal goals.

115
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,200
And I thought that Steve Jobs

116
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,400
had this metaphor that technology

117
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,240
could be a bicycle

118
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,560
for the human mind, you know,

119
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,720
that it would almost be

120
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,760
like an Iron Man suit.

121
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
Like we could express our potential

122
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,360
with these tools

123
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,040
at a pace that

124
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,600
we'd never been able to before.

125
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,160
You could move

126
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,000
on the speed of thought.

127
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,720
And then, we sort of live

128
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,240
in this dystopian reality where,

129
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,520
you know that t shirt

130
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,080
that has, like, you know,

131
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,720
the ape and then

132
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,360
a homo sapiens standing tall

133
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,120
and then humans behind a laptop

134
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,640
and then we look like an ape again.

135
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,240
It's like we live

136
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,440
in this dystopian reality

137
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,520
where it feels like we're slaves

138
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,960
to our devices instead of

139
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,800
the other way around

140
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,320
where these technologies

141
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,360
are empowering us.

142
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,960
Like, why is that.

143
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,520
And so, with Everest,

144
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,274
I was trying to build a social network

145
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:46,494
except around doing things

146
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,960
instead of around who you know.

147
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,582
And you would have

148
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,879
all your goals in the app.

149
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,200
And I thought that

150
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,960
we could live up

151
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,680
to that Da Vinci and Dream,

152
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,760
have a new renaissance

153
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,880
and have people pursue

154
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,240
their full potential

155
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,520
and have technology actually help.

156
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,560
But the company failed.

157
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,960
The app failed.

158
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,738
And it was a very humbling

159
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:09,120
sort of Icarus experience where

160
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,320
I had to learn a number of lessons,

161
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,160
both about how to build a great product,

162
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,400
how to build a great business.

163
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,120
But it also made me rethink

164
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,120
some of the fundamentals.

165
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,880
And with Invisible, my current company,

166
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,360
I've tried not to compromise

167
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,960
on the vision.

168
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,640
I think same vision.

169
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,840
Just different business model,

170
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,720
different mission.

171
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,080
And I've been trying

172
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,040
to apply the learnings

173
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,480
to solve a very, very different problem,

174
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,320
which is industrializing knowledge work.

175
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,680
So, before we go into that,

176
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,880
I have to go back a little bit

177
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,200
and understand about

178
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,440
that Icarus-like experience.

179
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,040
Because inevitably, you know,

180
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,960
almost all entrepreneurs

181
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,509
are going to fail multiple times

182
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,760
until they get to their success.

183
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,200
And I'd love to focus

184
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,440
a little bit on this side of the story.

185
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,560
I remember when you came

186
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,600
to speak to us,

187
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,840
I remember how we all looked

188
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,320
at this amazing product

189
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,960
that you are building,

190
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,120
and the charisma and the vision.

191
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,880
And we all bought into it immediately.

192
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,149
We knew this was going to be

193
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,920
a major success.

194
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,320
We loved it.

195
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,200
And you have to understand, Francis,

196
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,680
that this is a bunch of you know,

197
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,760
16, 17 year-olds entrepreneur wannabes,

198
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,480
that they're getting so excited

199
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,480
and are buying into these products.

200
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,880
I need to have this closure

201
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,440
to understand what happened there

202
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,320
and why do you call this

203
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
an Icarus-like experience?

204
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,120
And what lessons really

205
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,360
do you translate now

206
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,120
to your next venture?

207
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,960
Yeah.

208
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,520
It was a beautiful product.

209
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,640
Apple featured it many times,

210
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,880
I think the design community recognized

211
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,240
the work that our designers had done.

212
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,640
And it was before Facebook

213
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,400
had an iPhone app.

214
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,640
Remember when they were

215
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,400
Facebook thought their corporate strategy

216
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,280
for a few years

217
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,600
was they were going to be Web only.

218
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,840
Until they realized

219
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,000
that it was a mistake.

220
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,280
It was the early days of the App Store.

221
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,480
And we had nearly half

222
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,720
a million people use it.

223
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,760
And their initial experience

224
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,160
with Everest was kind of this,

225
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,640
you know, euphoric experience.

226
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,600
Wow, I could put all my goals

227
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
and dreams into the app.

228
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
I want to go to Italy.

229
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,080
I want to look like Daniel Craig

230
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,920
in a bathing suit.

231
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,440
I want to run a marathon.

232
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,520
I want to buy a house.

233
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,280
You know, all the things,

234
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,840
you just fantasize, almost,

235
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,440
that part was easy.

236
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,200
But where the business failed

237
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,240
is that three, four, five,

238
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,440
six months later,

239
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,920
people would stop making progress

240
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,120
on their goals.

241
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,400
It was almost like Instagram

242
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,920
for your goals

243
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,280
where you could post photos and videos,

244
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,430
but also complete steps

245
00:07:36,431 --> 00:07:39,080
like a checklist and make progress.

246
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,360
And the discipline required was too high.

247
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,586
So, our business model

248
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,440
ended up looking like a gym.

249
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,760
You know, gyms don't make money

250
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,160
when you get fit.

251
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,920
Gyms make money

252
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,480
when you want to get fit.

253
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,240
They divorce monetization from retention.

254
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,800
And that was a key principle

255
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,680
that we'd missed.

256
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,080
And we thought

257
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
we were going to be

258
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,600
a business model look like Facebook.

259
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,080
But basically that business model

260
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,200
is selling dopamine like a drug

261
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,400
and like a digital cigarette.

262
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,320
And it doesn't really require effort

263
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,480
or follow through.

264
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,840
And so, oops, a beginner's mistake.

265
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,480
And that was the Icarus moment.

266
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,040
So, fast forward to today.

267
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,440
Tell me a little bit about

268
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,040
the insights of the industry

269
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,560
in the market even before

270
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,760
we get to the actual product.

271
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,440
Because you have

272
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,600
some really fascinating insights

273
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,800
into where we're headed

274
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,400
as a global economy, and the workforce,

275
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
and that's leading into what

276
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,360
you are working on today.

277
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,160
So, I'd love to really

278
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,080
get into your mind,

279
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,280
and understand the motivation

280
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,160
behind what you are you doing

281
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,040
and taking a little bit

282
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,160
of a leap forward into

283
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,960
what's going to happen

284
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,120
in the next few decades.

285
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,800
Yeah. I'll start by describing

286
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,840
what Invisible is

287
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,480
and then I'll share some,

288
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,960
some predictions about the future.

289
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,480
So, every company has complex

290
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,960
and custom processes

291
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,360
and they're very difficult to automate.

292
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,680
Even if you know about

293
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:07,480
all the latest automation tools,

294
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,600
even if you're aware

295
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,320
of robotic process automation, RPA tools

296
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,440
or workflow

297
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,960
or no code automation tools,

298
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,600
or you're aware of the relevant,

299
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,160
you know, software point solutions

300
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,520
for the particular function

301
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,360
you're trying to automate.

302
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,360
So, it's sales or hiring, the marketing

303
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,160
or an industry specific, you know,

304
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,240
workflow you're trying to build.

305
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,120
They're all these tools.

306
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,680
There's an app for everything,

307
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,280
why isn't everything perfect yet.

308
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,720
And the answer is that when you try

309
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,040
to automate your process,

310
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,891
any one tool might help you automate

311
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:41,120
five, 10, 15% of it.

312
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,160
But you can't get

313
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,637
the end to end solution you need

314
00:09:43,638 --> 00:09:45,720
to run your business tomorrow.

315
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,760
So, what do you do?

316
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,960
You either do the rest of it

317
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,760
in-house manually,

318
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,000
or you outsource it

319
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,720
to a traditional outsourcing company.

320
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,880
A business process outsource or a BPO.

321
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,280
And BPOs are like law firms.

322
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,520
Their incentive is to bill you

323
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,760
as many hours as possible.

324
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,600
They're selling labor

325
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,520
They don't have an incentive

326
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,960
to automate on their side.

327
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,760
So, Invisible is combining outsourcing

328
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,520
and automation for the first time,

329
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,720
and we call it work sharing.

330
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,080
And our technology

331
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,000
is a digital assembly line.

332
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,480
And it has two layers:

333
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,920
the first is we coordinate 280 workers

334
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,240
in 35 countries around the world

335
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,400
who can log in to secure virtual desktops

336
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,160
and follow step by step instructions

337
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,360
to do the manual portions of the work;

338
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,480
and then the second layer

339
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,320
is that we break down

340
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,880
these custom processes

341
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,400
into standard steps.

342
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,640
We think of it like sequencing

343
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,360
in the corporate process genome,

344
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,080
and then we will automate

345
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,280
those steps over time

346
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,800
and they become reusable.

347
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,640
And our business model is a win win.

348
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,680
As we automate your process,

349
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,160
your unit price goes down

350
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,720
and our margins go up.

351
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,480
So, it's a win win.

352
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,240
We have an incentive to automate

353
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,040
and you see your prices drop.

354
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,400
And our inspiration for all this

355
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,200
was what Henry Ford did

356
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
to manufacturing

357
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,240
in the early 20th century.

358
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,080
Every, you know,

359
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,200
this is like pre world war I.

360
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,360
I mean, the whole story

361
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,160
of Ford from like 1908

362
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,360
to say, 1960, is fascinating.

363
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,720
But every year,

364
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,240
the quality of their cars improved,

365
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,560
the price decreased,

366
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,200
their revenue increased,

367
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,920
their margins increased,

368
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,080
and the amount that they paid

369
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,920
their workers increased.

370
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,680
These things are

371
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,600
in trade off relationships.

372
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,840
This shouldn't happen.

373
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,760
And it only happens through

374
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,080
the economic miracle

375
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,360
of productivity gains

376
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,160
which create deflation.

377
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,680
And deflation is good.

378
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,400
I call it

379
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,520
the deflationary gospel of capitalism.

380
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Better, faster, cheaper,

381
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,120
better, faster, cheaper.

382
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,960
And I think that

383
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
we're at a stage where

384
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,040
the mission of the company, with Invisible,

385
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,320
is industrializing knowledge work.

386
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,680
It's not automating knowledge work.

387
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,520
It's industrializing it.

388
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,320
And it implies

389
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,920
a more nuanced view of automation.

390
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,680
And this is what I'd like

391
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,360
to communicate to your audience.

392
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,160
Most people in Silicon Valley,

393
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,040
they have a hammer

394
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,160
and everything is a nail.

395
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,400
And that hammer is tools.

396
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,320
And they're going to build

397
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,600
a tool for everything.

398
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,720
And the mindset is pure software.

399
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,080
AI is going to do everything.

400
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,200
Humans are irrelevant.

401
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,880
Humans aren't even going

402
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,840
to exist in the future.

403
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,840
Ultron is coming.

404
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,480
And I think this is ridiculous.

405
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,600
And I think this is where some

406
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,280
of the liberal arts background kicks in.

407
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,760
I think, in many times

408
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,280
in our history,

409
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,040
we've always thought

410
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,640
we're at an exponential curve

411
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,120
and it didn't end up happening.

412
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,400
Things happened quite differently.

413
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,000
If you read Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath,

414
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,800
for example, with the tractors coming

415
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,200
and automating agriculture,

416
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,520
arguably the productivity gains

417
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,200
of that era were greater than the ones

418
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,400
that we're experiencing today.

419
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,480
This is what I think is likely to happen.

420
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,160
I'll speak in

421
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,400
very broad statistical terms.

422
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,160
There are just,

423
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
a pop quiz for your audience.

424
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,920
There are eight billion people

425
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,680
on the planet,

426
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,960
how many people play video games?

427
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,240
Think about it. Put the answer in your head.

428
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,720
Two billion.

429
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:25,584
It's three billion.

430
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:27,840
Three to four billion.

431
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,360
And then how many people

432
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,840
do knowledge work?

433
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,360
Like, make their livelihood

434
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,600
on a computer in some way?

435
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,120
One billion.

436
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,040
You did your homework.

437
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,240
Exactly.

438
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,960
So, there are one third to one quarter

439
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,174
as many knowledge workers

440
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:49,480
as there are video gamers.

441
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,800
Now, I'm going to attribute this

442
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,480
to Cathie Wood at ARK Invest,

443
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,320
whose research I follow closely.

444
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,400
But basically video gaming

445
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,560
is like a sort of onboarding.

446
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,080
It's training for the world's

447
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,560
future knowledge workers.

448
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,240
And if you think about

449
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,040
what's going to happen over

450
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,360
the course of our lifetime,

451
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,120
do we think

452
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,480
there are going to be less than

453
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,600
a billion knowledge workers

454
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
by the time we die

455
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,720
or more than a billion knowledge workers.

456
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,480
And it just seems sort of obvious,

457
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,680
sort of ask the audience

458
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,320
to grant it to me

459
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,040
as a premise or an axiom

460
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,600
or an assumption.

461
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,840
I could defend it, but I just think

462
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,600
it's so sort of obvious

463
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
on its face that

464
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,680
there are going to be many, many

465
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,320
more knowledge workers.

466
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,680
It doesn't make sense

467
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,680
that one out of every eight people,

468
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,040
work on the Internet.

469
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,400
And seven out of every eight people work

470
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
in the physical world.

471
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,040
The digital world

472
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,520
is becoming more and more part

473
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,480
of everything that we do.

474
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,480
Every industry

475
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,600
is basically becoming digitized.

476
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,920
So. I think they're complimentary trends

477
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,120
in robotics, you know.

478
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,200
But I think that basically

479
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,400
in our lifetime, we're going to have

480
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,160
up to four billion knowledge workers,

481
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,640
maybe more.

482
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,600
So, think about what that means

483
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,040
in terms of automation.

484
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,720
If we were actually going

485
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,560
to automate even 50%

486
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,080
of knowledge work,

487
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,600
then we would go

488
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,000
from a billion knowledge workers

489
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,560
to 500 million knowledge workers

490
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,400
in our lifetime.

491
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,800
And 500 million other people

492
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,000
would have to either be unemployed

493
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,840
or find some physical work to do.

494
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,760
But I think the opposite

495
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,400
is going to occur.

496
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,440
I think what we're going to experience

497
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,720
is net negative automation.

498
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,960
That doesn't mean

499
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,680
we're not going to automate.

500
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,280
We're going to automate a lot.

501
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,200
But I think the key economic principle

502
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,120
is work can be created faster

503
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,920
than it can be destroyed.

504
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,600
And we can destroy it pretty fast.

505
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,200
We can industrialize it and automate it

506
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,320
and build all these tools pretty fast.

507
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,920
But not as quickly as we can create it.

508
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,640
And I think that we're going to be

509
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,400
in a sort of dialectic

510
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,880
where humans are doing a thing

511
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,200
and then computers learn

512
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,040
how to do that thing.

513
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,560
And then humans do another thing,

514
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,120
like a new trick

515
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,880
that we then teach

516
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,840
the robots and then

517
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,560
we're going to keep doing that dialectic

518
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,640
for a lot longer than people think.

519
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,400
And I think that you want to design

520
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,560
your business model around that,

521
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,640
or at least our business model

522
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,760
has been designed around that.

523
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,280
I think that those are going to be

524
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,040
the really interesting opportunities.

525
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,720
Not necessarily the selling pure,

526
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,200
pure SaaS, pure tools.

527
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,840
Francis, why do you care

528
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,320
so much about this? Why?

529
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,626
I mean, I saw how much you cared

530
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:22,360
about Everest.

531
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,280
I saw that passion.

532
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,680
And I'm seeing the passion now.

533
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,440
I'm feeling as if I'm back

534
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,040
in that MIT class in 2013.

535
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,240
Why do you care so much

536
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,840
about this stuff?

537
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,960
Because the future doesn't,

538
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,320
I mean, almost by definition,

539
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,080
should be very different than the past

540
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,680
and presumably better.

541
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,840
And I think one way

542
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,280
of thinking about it is

543
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,920
if you saw a human being

544
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,400
that was seven feet tall,

545
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:47,680
you'd be like,

546
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,040
wow, that person is pretty tall.

547
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,040
You saw a human being

548
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,480
that was eight feet tall.

549
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,080
You'd be like, are you

550
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,520
in the Guinness Book of World Records?

551
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
Like, you're like

552
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,800
three standard deviations, tall.

553
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,960
If you saw a human being

554
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,360
that was 70 feet tall,

555
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,760
you'd call the military.

556
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,480
It's an alien.

557
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,520
It's not a human anymore.

558
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,400
It's like, you know, it's Godzilla.

559
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,120
It's a giant.

560
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,520
There are just not

561
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,680
80 foot tall humans.

562
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,040
But that's a metaphor

563
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,520
for what is possible

564
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,600
with productivity gains.

565
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,080
And I think that

566
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,880
the mindset of Silicon Valley

567
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,960
has been the Turing test,

568
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,654
which is when can computers do

569
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:23,398
all the things that humans can do

570
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:24,240
that we can't tell.

571
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,200
And I think that that's the wrong test

572
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,920
for a number of reasons.

573
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,020
I think the more interesting test

574
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:29,742
is the da Vinci test, which is I think

575
00:17:29,743 --> 00:17:31,800
Steve Jobs's original intent.

576
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,840
Which is, you know,

577
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,120
in the 21st century,

578
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,560
when will the average person

579
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,960
be more productive

580
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,080
than the most productive person

581
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,080
in the 15th century.

582
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,440
And I think that in sort of a

583
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,120
a one on one productivity test,

584
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,840
da Vinci with his piece of paper,

585
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,320
would school any millennial

586
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,160
with their laptop and iPhone.

587
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,320
And I think that

588
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,800
that's the embarrassing thing.

589
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,760
That we have all this information

590
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,280
and all these tools,

591
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,480
and yet we're spending

592
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
so much of our time

593
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,440
not being creative

594
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,080
and not being strategic.

595
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,800
So, I think part of my message is,

596
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,320
is deeply optimistic.

597
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:18,560
I think I really believe in the good

598
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:21,320
that humans are capable of.

599
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,160
But part of it is like a real

600
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,000
reprimand in a sense,

601
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,960
like an exhortation.

602
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,377
Like we,

603
00:18:28,378 --> 00:18:32,266
Harvard said that up to 50%,

604
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:34,880
41% of the average knowledge workers time

605
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,000
is spent doing work that is repetitive.

606
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,520
And I think we just did not

607
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,640
get the education

608
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,920
and the opportunities that we have.

609
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,640
And we do not live

610
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,200
in this incredible era

611
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,560
in order to spend half

612
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,640
of our time doing irrelevant,

613
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,520
doing work that

614
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,760
isn't our highest contribution.

615
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,000
Right?

616
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,670
And we should have a certain urgency

617
00:18:54,671 --> 00:19:00,640
around solving problems, creating things.

618
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,480
And I think that,

619
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,657
Peter Thiel has I think,

620
00:19:04,658 --> 00:19:05,920
has the right philosophy,

621
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,640
the right pessimism

622
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,400
in his basic message,

623
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,000
which is that like, you know,

624
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,200
the iPhone is new,

625
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,520
our digital devices are new,

626
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,080
but when you walk around our cities,

627
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,920
they still feel like

628
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,320
they're in the 20th century.

629
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,440
Why is that.

630
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
You know.

631
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,080
And I think that there are,

632
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,241
Cathie Wood in ARK Invest

633
00:19:24,242 --> 00:19:26,760
talks about five technology platforms

634
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,840
that are disrupting

635
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,080
pretty much have the potential

636
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,920
to disrupt every aspect of our society.

637
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,031
I think the five are,

638
00:19:33,231 --> 00:19:34,720
I'm going to hope I get this right:

639
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,600
FinTech and blockchain

640
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,360
robotics and industrial automation,

641
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,400
AI and automation,

642
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,120
which Invisible is in,

643
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,640
and sort of software automation

644
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,200
enterprise tools,

645
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,400
the genomic revolution,

646
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,000
everything is happening

647
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,520
with CRISPR and gene editing

648
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,560
and everything that's happening

649
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,760
with autonomous vehicles.

650
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,200
I think those are the five.

651
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,000
But the reason I list them out

652
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,400
is that there's, you know,

653
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,919
this is such an exciting time

654
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,600
to be alive.

655
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
But we kind of have

656
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,200
to have a fire about it.

657
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,240
What's the phrase,

658
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,720
"light a fire under your ass".

659
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,400
I can definitely feel the fire,

660
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,960
the passion, the urgency.

661
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,280
I'm getting so much inspiration.

662
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,040
But Francis, before we end,

663
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,800
you have to tell me

664
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,920
the Peter Thiel story.

665
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,640
You told it to me seven years ago

666
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,320
back in MIT launch with Everest.

667
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
I need the short version now

668
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,040
for the audience.

669
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,360
Because it will be just fascinating.

670
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,400
If you feel comfortable with it,

671
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,880
of course.

672
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,760
Sure.

673
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,600
So, yeah.

674
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,760
He is one of the people

675
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,855
that I look up to most.

676
00:20:39,856 --> 00:20:40,760
Still to this day,

677
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,800
I think he's an intellectual giant.

678
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,920
And I just graduated from college

679
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,800
and I was starting Everest

680
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
and I had some people interested

681
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,280
in investing but hadn't been able

682
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,800
to make a breakthrough there.

683
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,200
And I met someone at an airport.

684
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,560
You know,

685
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,920
right when pretty much

686
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,400
I was thinking about quitting

687
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,920
and I was working

688
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,440
on the designs for the app.

689
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,260
And somebody

690
00:21:07,261 --> 00:21:08,683
looked over my shoulder

691
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,800
and saw the designs.

692
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,600
And then asked me some questions

693
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
and I answered them

694
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,280
and I told them about

695
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,640
the idea and he said,

696
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,520
"Would you like to raise money?"

697
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,200
And I said, "Yes."

698
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,400
And they said, "For who?"

699
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,960
Well, you know, from who

700
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,840
angels or VCs.

701
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,326
And I said,

702
00:21:20,327 --> 00:21:22,520
"Angels. But specifically,

703
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:24,084
Peter Thiel."

704
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:24,507
He's like,

705
00:21:24,508 --> 00:21:25,400
"Well, I actually happened

706
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,560
to go to Stanford with Peter

707
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,800
and I can introduce you."

708
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,040
And I spent half an hour,

709
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,160
tops, talking to Peter,

710
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,320
telling him about it.

711
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,907
And he said,

712
00:21:34,908 --> 00:21:36,680
"Well, send me some some materials."

713
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,040
And I just wrote

714
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,920
a 50 page business plan.

715
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:42,880
Everest created one of the first

716
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,800
web based pitch decks.

717
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,920
And we released it right around Christmas

718
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,760
and didn't hear from him.

719
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,720
And then New Year's Eve,

720
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:49,840
sure, I'm in for 50k.

721
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,760
And then everyone else came in

722
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,520
and we raised two point six million

723
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,760
and did this journey

724
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,680
for three or four years.

725
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,480
And it was a lucky break.

726
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,120
But something I think

727
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,720
I'm always going to be grateful for

728
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,160
and I think they're still,

729
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,320
I think it's a good example of some magic,

730
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,120
you know.

731
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,400
There are certain things

732
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,000
like generally, you should operate

733
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,800
with assumption that every single win

734
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
you have to fully earn it.

735
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:21,366
And, you know,

736
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:24,240
but as I look back over my career,

737
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,640
there have been

738
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,720
a number of people that have

739
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,040
given me favor and key moments,

740
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:34,560
and those were fortunate circumstances,

741
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,840
I'm very grateful for them.

742
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,720
And I think that's part

743
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,680
of what made Silicon Valley great.

744
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,640
And I think it's still there.

745
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,960
Francis, I love it.

746
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,280
Thank you for sharing the story.

747
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,840
Thank you for sharing

748
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,440
all the other stories.

749
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,440
This was just inspiring

750
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,160
to listen to again

751
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,120
and with the new insights.

752
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,320
And I can't wait

753
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,480
to keep following your journey

754
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,800
and continue getting inspired.

755
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,560
So, thank you for everything

756
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,800
that you're doing.

757
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,320
Both to me, the listeners,

758
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,120
but also to humanity,

759
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,240
when with all the different products

760
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,160
that your building.

761
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,480
Before we leave, I have to ask you

762
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,600
the most important question,

763
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,440
which is three words that you

764
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,560
would use to describe yourself.

765
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,000
And I know that

766
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,040
I'm already keeping you late,

767
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,040
so thank you for being

768
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,760
generous with your time.

769
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,444
Yeah.

770
00:23:14,445 --> 00:23:19,080
Iconoclast, classicist and amateur.

771
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,200
Iconoclast, because I tend

772
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,960
to go against the norms,

773
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,880
even when the norms are aesthetic.

774
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,600
Contrarian is a word we're familiar with.

775
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,680
But iconoclasm has a sort

776
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,680
of aesthetic connotation

777
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,566
that sometimes,

778
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:34,512
being a contrarian kind of,

779
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,560
it's actually unpopular and weird

780
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,760
and even can look ugly.

781
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,560
And it's like, what are you doing,

782
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,960
it's a weirdo.

783
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,640
And I think you have to embrace that.

784
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,720
And then classicists, because I think

785
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,640
that which is ancient,

786
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,760
is often futuristic.

787
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,400
There's the things that don't change

788
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,560
that you can learn the most from.

789
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,400
And I think reading original sources

790
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,280
in general is good,

791
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,000
and particularly when it comes to books.

792
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,080
I love reading books by dead people.

793
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,880
Then amateur, because

794
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,120
in the old word "amatore",

795
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,160
you have to have a certain love

796
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,120
for trying new things

797
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,480
and being like a child

798
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,760
and making mistakes.

799
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,960
So, I have many things

800
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,160
that I do that I'm not an expert in

801
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,520
by any stretch of the imagination.

802
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,880
Like I love to paint.

803
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,800
I love to learn about subjects

804
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,160
I know very little about.

805
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,040
Like I was reading a bunch

806
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,200
of white papers about

807
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,240
autonomous vehicles

808
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,520
and it's totally out of my depth.

809
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,960
But, hey, I think

810
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,560
that helps make you well-rounded.

811
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,040
And I think that

812
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,360
for a couple hundred years,

813
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,040
everyone's been trying

814
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,600
to become more specialized.

815
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
But I think going back

816
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,720
to the Renaissance idea

817
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,000
of being the polymath and being versatile

818
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,480
is a better way to go.

819
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,280
But to do that, you have to embrace

820
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,360
the identity of an amateur.

821
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,120
Francis, thank you so, so much.

822
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,360
This is wonderful.

823
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,920
Stay safe and stay healthy.

824
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,480
Thank you again.

825
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,160
Cheers Michael.
