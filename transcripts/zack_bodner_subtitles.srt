1
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,300
Zack Bodner, thank you so much for 
joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

2
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,300
It’s my pleasure. 
Thank you for inviting me, Michael.

3
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,000
You know, when I look at you, 
I think of the person

4
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,300
that’s allowing me 
to get Israeli entertainment

5
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,000
in Palo Alto because 
before corona times,

6
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I would come almost weekly 
to the JCC for the

7
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,300
weekly Israeli artists. 
I know that I may be

8
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,300
experiencing the JCC different 
than a lot of other people

9
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,300
around the community, 
but that’s --

10
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,000
you gave me such a great gift. 
So, first of all, thank you.

11
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,300
It’s really great.

12
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,300
It’s my pleasure. 
And I’m glad that

13
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,300
you’re taking advantage 
of all of the opportunities

14
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,000
we’re offering, or at least one 
of the many opportunities

15
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,700
we’re offering. 
And in this time of lockdown,

16
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,300
we’re doing a virtual -- 
all of JCC. And the Israeli stuff

17
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,700
that’s happening on Facebook Live 
is phenomenal.

18
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,300
So, I hope you’re taking advantage 
of that as well.

19
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,300
- A hundred percent. 
- There’s a lot of other stuff you

20
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,300
could be doing as well, Michael.
And when we open up,

21
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,300
hopefully, sometime soon, 
I’m happy to share with you

22
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,300
what those are as well.

23
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,300
I would love that, Zack, 
you’ve been involved

24
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,300
on the intersection of 
Israel-America Judaism for so long.

25
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,900
But actually, you started off 
by playing varsity soccer in Yale.

26
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,500
Is that correct?

27
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,000
[laughs]

28
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,500
Yes. I don’t know 
if that’s where I started,

29
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,700
but I definitely started 
at a certain point there.

30
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:17,300
Yes, I did. I went to Yale 
to get the great education

31
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,300
that Yale offers 
and to play soccer.

32
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,300
I was recruited 
to play soccer there.

33
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,000
I played goalie 
and it was an

34
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
incredible experience. 
I actually took

35
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,300
a little bit of a break. 
I went and studied

36
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,300
at Hebrew University in Jerusalem 
for one semester,

37
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,300
my junior year 
at the Rockford School.

38
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,300
And while I was there, 
I actually played with

39
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,700
[Hapoel Jerusalem]
so I played a little bit of ball

40
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,700
- with them and throughout --
- No way, you played --

41
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,300
professionally 
with [Hapoel Jerusalem]?

42
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,700
Not officially because 
I was playing NCAA ball.

43
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,300
NCAA is the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association.

44
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,300
So when you're playing with them --

45
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,300
Actually, my girlfriend 
at Stanford just won

46
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,300
the national championship 
this year

47
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,300
- as a striker.
- Hey, mazel tov!

48
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,300
Mazel tov [unclear].
Great.

49
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,000
[laughs]

50
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So, I trained with them.

51
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,300
I trained with Hapoel, I didn't 
play officially with them.

52
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,300
But it was a great experience. 
That’s what changed my life

53
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,700
that time in Israel, 
I met the woman

54
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,300
who I ended up marrying,

55
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:03,800
- Wow!
- Ronit

56
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,300
-- became my wife and made 
the best friends of my life.

57
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,300
I came back and I realized 
this is what I wanted to do

58
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,300
with my life, something related 
to Israel and the Jewish people.

59
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,300
- So, here I am. 
- What did you study at Yale?

60
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,300
I studied psychology and I focused 
on psychology of religion.

61
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,300
I’ve always been a seeker. 
I’ve always been kind of a Jew

62
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,300
in the wilderness, right? 
Looking for the answers.

63
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,300
And so, this was kind of like, 
"Why do people ask these

64
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,300
big life questions?" 
And I thought,

65
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,300
"Why does the dog 
howl at the moon?"

66
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,300
These are the sort of questions 
that I was always asking

67
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,300
that led me ultimately 
to graduate school.

68
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,300
work in philosophy of religion 
and theology, which is highly

69
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,900
marketable, let me tell you. 
What you’re doing with GSB

70
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,300
is going to get you 
a much better job

71
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,300
out of graduate school 
than what I did

72
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,300
with a graduate degree 
in theology, Michael.

73
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Amazing! I definitely -- 
GSB’s definitely

74
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,300
in my radar right now. 
I’m still in the undergrad,

75
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,000
but I love that -- 
I love -- people

76
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,300
think that I’m in the GSB. 
So, right now, it’s planting seeds

77
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,300
in my mind that I know 
I can get there,

78
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,300
and I’ll get there one day.

79
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,300
- Exactly. Exactly.
- Wonderful.

80
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,700
I think it’s your maturity 
having spent time in the army.

81
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,300
You’re older than most 
of the young students

82
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,300
at Stanford, I think.

83
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,300
I hope to get there one day. 
And I just love it.

84
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,300
I am trying to take a bunch 
of GSB courses because it’s --

85
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,300
just the building next door. 
But that’s for another topic. Zack,

86
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,300
I want to talk for a second 
about Judaism 4.0.

87
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,300
You had a great TEDx talk 
that you gave about it

88
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,300
and I love the very first sentence 
that you said.

89
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,300
You said Judaism 
is a lot of things,

90
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,700
but at the same time, 
it’s none of those things.

91
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,700
So, please give me a little bit 
of insight into

92
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,300
what is this Judaism 4.0.

93
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,300
Yeah, right. Well, Judaism is -- 
it’s a religion.

94
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,300
It’s not a religion. 
It’s a people.

95
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,000
It’s not a people. 
It’s an ethnicity.

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,300
It’s not an ethnicity. 
It’s a moral code.

97
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,700
It’s a culture, right? 
It’s all of the above

98
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,300
and none of the above. 
It’s 3,000 years old,

99
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,300
and yet, people are still confused 
by what Judaism is.

100
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,700
- Definitely.
- And that’s because it's evolved

101
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,300
over time. And I talk about 
4.0, Michael, because

102
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,300
I believe we’re in 
the fourth era of Judaism.

103
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,700
The first era was the era 
of the Mishkan.

104
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,300
We were wandering in the desert 
and our portable holiness

105
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,300
went with us. 2.0, we settled 
in Israel, the Holy Land.

106
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,300
We built the temple. 
It was destroyed.

107
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,000
Built the next temple. 
It was destroyed.

108
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,300
But that period of centrality, 
our spirituality had a home.

109
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,300
And then, destroyed in 70 CE. 
You know the story.

110
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,300
And ever since then, 
we’ve been in the 3.0 era,

111
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,700
which is the dispersion --

112
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,700
- Right. 
- the exile, right?

113
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,000
But what’s happening, 
and ever since

114
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,300
the kind of the enlightenment, 
is Judaism has started

115
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,300
to realize that it can also be 
a part of secular

116
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,000
society, too, right? 
And this is what's

117
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,300
confused people about -- 
is it religion

118
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,300
or is it not a religion? 
How can you convert out, and yet,

119
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,300
how can the Nazis still say, 
“Well, you’re Jewish,”

120
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,300
even if you converted? 
Does it mean there’s a blood issue,

121
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,000
there’s ethnicity? 
Well, now, we know Jews

122
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,300
can also be Asian. 
They can be African-American.

123
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,360
- Right.
- They can be Latino, right?

124
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,300
It’s not just about Yiddish.

125
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,300
It’s not ashkenormative. Right?

126
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,300
As we think about.

127
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,000
- I have heard that one before.
- There's Sephardi Jews. I married

128
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,500
a nice Sephardi girl.

129
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,000
I like that.

130
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,500
[laughs]

131
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,300
Yeah.

132
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,300
So, we’re now 
in this moment of 4.0.

133
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,300
We’re on the cusp. 
And it’s a lot of different factors

134
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,700
that are contributing 
to this moment,

135
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,300
but it’s creating 
a sociological crash.

136
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,300
Right? Our whole outlook 
has been flipped on its head.

137
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,000
So, we have to ask ourselves, 
what is the Judaism

138
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,300
of the future going to look like? 
So, our job, our vision at the JCC

139
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300
here in Palo Alto 
is to be the architects

140
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,300
of the Jewish future. 
We consider ourselves

141
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,300
to be the ones helping people 
think about how can they do

142
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,300
Jewish their way. 
So, Michael, you came

143
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
and you connected 
to your Israeli-ness --

144
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,300
- Right.
- here at the JCC, right?

145
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,300
And so, one of the things 
we’re saying is,

146
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,300
how do the Israelis bring 
their version of Judaism here

147
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,300
to American-Jews 
and how can we

148
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,300
as American-Jews 
export that to Israel?

149
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,300
That’s one of things 
we need to think about, right?

150
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,300
Because a lot of Israelis,
as you probably know,

151
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,300
think that you’re either secular 
or you’re orthodox.

152
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,300
And they’ll recognize 
us a lot in between.

153
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,300
Right? And American Judaism 
has this whole Mosaic

154
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,700
in between our idea of 
[Khilonim]

155
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,300
- Yeah.
- Right?

156
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,300
But if Israelis can see that here 
and bring that back --

157
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,300
So, I’ll give you an example.

158
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,300
- Right?
- Please.

159
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,000
Some Israelis, 
shlichim

160
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,700
who come here experience 
American Judaism,

161
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,300
they saw what a reformed 
Jewish synagogue,

162
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,300
a Friday night service 
could be like.

163
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,300
And they went back, 
and they brought that

164
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,300
to the Namal in Tel-Aviv, 
on the port.

165
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
And now you go on a Friday night --

166
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:04,800
Yeah.

167
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,700
-- with beautiful service, right?

168
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,700
Mixed men and women, and singing.

169
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,300
- And Israeli would be like,
- Yeah.

170
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,300
- "Mazel! What is this?" Right?
- [laughs]

171
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,300
That’s an Israeli import

172
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,300
from American Judaism.

173
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,300
- Right.
-By the same token,

174
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,300
I think we, in America, 
we need to import

175
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,300
the idea of the Mechina program.

176
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,700
- Yeah.
- The idea of Jewish service

177
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,300
that all Israelis like you 
serve in the army.

178
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,300
How can we do this 
for American-Jews,

179
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,300
so they feel like 
they’re a part of something

180
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
in the community and not just, 
“I’ve had my bar mitzvah.

181
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,300
[unclear] I’m done.”

182
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,300
Right now, I think one 
of the things I was exposed at

183
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,300
is through J-Ventures, 
which you’re also an LP of,

184
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,300
and the fun that 
we’re both involved with.

185
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
But I came to the room 
and you had about

186
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,300
a hundred partners in the room, 
all incredible executives

187
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,300
and investors. 
A lot of them, Israelis;

188
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,300
a lot of them, American-Jewish. 
And all of a sudden,

189
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,300
I believe there were some 
Americans there who said that

190
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
this is their first 
interaction with Israelis.

191
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,300
Israelis, all of a sudden, are
communicating with American-Jews

192
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
and not just, you know, 
in the Sunnyvale kibbutz

193
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,300
So, I think that I’m learning 
also that there are

194
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,300
these huge differences. 
And one of the things

195
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,300
that I was exposed 
to was the idea that, as an Israeli,

196
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,300
I don’t remember 
the last time my friends and

197
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,300
I really visited 
a synagogue in Israel.

198
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Yet, a lot of my 
Jewish friends here,

199
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,300
it’s kind of a thing 
to go to synagogue.

200
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,300
And it almost feels like 
you’re more Jewish than I am,

201
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,300
and I’m very Jewish.  
So, it’s very interesting to see

202
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,300
all these different cultures 
come together.

203
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Right. I think that 
with your experiencing

204
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,300
and being a part of -- 
with J-Ventures and at the JCC

205
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,300
is this acknowledgement 
that we can learn from each other

206
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,300
and be a part 
of each other’s worlds,

207
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,300
and give and take spiritually, 
culturally, religiously.

208
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,300
And then, we can love each other 
as a family even if we disagree.

209
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,300
- Yeah.
- And this is the part that

210
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,000
I fear actually, Michael, 
is that this next generation

211
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,300
of young American-Jews 
are only judging

212
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,300
their relationship with Israel 
through the two things

213
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,300
that they have issues with. Right? 
the Israel’s treatment

214
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,300
of the Palestinians and also 
the Chief Rabbinate of Israel.

215
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,300
The two things that many 
American-Jews disagree with,

216
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,300
that’s the whole lens 
though which they view Israel

217
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,300
is through those two things. 
And I’m saying no, no, no.

218
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,300
The relationship with Israel 
is much bigger,

219
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,300
much more beautiful, 
much longer lasting

220
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,700
and much more complicated. 
And you have to kind of transcend

221
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,300
those differences. 
And by the same token,

222
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,300
I’m saying to Israeli-Jews, 
don’t just look at us

223
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,300
as failed Zionists 
because we don’t have

224
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,300
the ḥutspâ [unclear]

225
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
Don’t just look at us and say, 
“You’re not even

226
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,300
going to be Jewish 
in a few generations

227
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,300
because of intermarriage 
or simulation, or anti-Semitism.

228
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,300
So, we’re talking past each other. 
And what you’re seeing

229
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,300
with organization like J-Ventures 
or the work we’re doing

230
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,300
here at the JCC 
is this integration,

231
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:39,300
the weaving together 
of Israeli-Jews and American-Jews,

232
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,300
and it’s making all of us better. 
And that way, if something happens

233
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
like in the next few weeks 
with annexation,

234
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,300
Michael, there’s going to be -- 
especially, in the liberal

235
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,300
bay area, there’s 
going to be a lot of

236
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,300
[unclear]
for American-Jews

237
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,300
around what’s happening in Israel. 
But if you love Israel

238
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,300
and you recognize 
that they have to make

239
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,300
some tough decisions 
that maybe we don’t agree with --

240
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
and we have every right 
to talk about

241
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,300
our positions in these 
but don’t let it define your

242
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,300
entire relationship with Israel. 
Right? Figure out how

243
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,000
just like when you’re sitting 
around the Shabbat table, Michael,

244
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,300
with your crazy Uncle Larry 
who has crazy views --

245
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,300
maybe he’s a Trump-lover 
and you’re not.

246
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,300
Or maybe he hates Trump 
and you love Trump,

247
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,300
but you’re still family. 
And you have to figure out

248
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,300
how to sit around 
the Shabbat’s table

249
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,300
and the Pesach table

250
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,300
and embrace each other 
even if you’re arguing.

251
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,700
This is what Jews have done 
for generations,

252
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,300
- the machloket. 
- Yeah.

253
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,300
We’ve never agreed on each other.

254
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,300
Yeah. You put two Jews in a room,
 you get three different opinions.

255
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,700
- Right?
- Exactly. Exactly.

256
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,300
Zack, talk to me a little bit 
about where are we headed.

257
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,700
You’re seeing these trends. 
You were a part of AIPAC

258
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,000
for many, many years. 
In leadership positions,

259
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,300
both at  the JCC and AIPAC, 
where are we headed,

260
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,300
let’s say, 10 years from now 
or 20 years from now?

261
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
Are there big changes? 
Are there different trends?

262
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,300
Optimism? Pessimism?

263
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,700
Yeah, I think that there are trends 
that can go either way, frankly.

264
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,300
Number 1, we’re seeing 
institutional affiliations

265
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
dropping. Right?
So, membership in American

266
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,300
synagogues is dropping, 
the old legacy institutions

267
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,300
are dropping. 
And you have the older

268
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,300
generation of Jews 
who are wringing their hands and

269
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,300
[unclear]
and worried but they shouldn’t be

270
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,300
because this next generation, 
your generation, you’re not

271
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
walking away from Judaism. 
They’re starting up new,

272
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,300
cool Jewish ways of doing, right? 
There’s the Urban Adamah,

273
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,300
and there's Moishe House,

274
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
and there’s Wilderness Torah, 
and there’s At The Well.

275
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,300
But there’s also 
this ethos of the Jewish

276
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,300
- Tikkun Olam social action, right?
- Okay.

277
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
Jews are doing Jewish 
by getting involved

278
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
with the racial 
justice movement.

279
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,300
Right? So, they’re still 
doing Jewish.

280
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,900
Right.

281
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,300
But the dropping 
of institutional affiliation

282
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
is going to change the landscape. 
That’s the trend

283
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,700
that we have to watch out for. 
The second trend

284
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,300
is the ethno-graphics 
are shifting, Michael,

285
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,700
which means that 
it’s no longer about,

286
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,300
are you Ashkenazi 
or you're Sephardi?

287
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,300
like I said, right?
There are Jews of color.

288
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,300
I’ll tell you a story. 
There’s a Japanese woman

289
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,300
on our board of directors here 
at the JCC. She’s not Jewish.

290
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,300
She didn’t convert. 
She married a Jewish guy.

291
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,300
The Jewish guy, 
he doesn’t really care

292
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,300
about doing Jewish. 
He’s happy that his wife cares.

293
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,300
She’s the one who’s doing --
She’s Japanese

294
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
and she’s the one driving 
the kids to Hebrew schools.

295
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
She’s the one 
who makes challah.

296
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,300
She’s the one 
who does the Passover.

297
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,300
So, tell me, who’s Jewish 
in that relationship?

298
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,300
- Right?
- Right.

299
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,300
The future is going to be long 
to those people

300
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,000
who choose to do Jew --

301
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,300
We’re all going to be 
Jews by choice.

302
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,700
Right? We’re all going to be 
Jews by choice.

303
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,300
That’s another trend 
we have to pay attention to.

304
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,300
The third is, 
this is the first time

305
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
ever, ever, ever in Jewish history

306
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
where there’s both 
a strong Jewish

307
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,300
homeland in Israel 
and a strong Jewish diaspora,

308
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,700
mainly here in America. 
It’s been one or the other,

309
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,300
but now we have both 
and figuring how we work together.

310
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,300
It goes back to 
what I was saying before.

311
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,000
We have to find a way 
to transcend our differences.

312
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,800
These trends are going to 
be incredibly important.

313
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
- The last thing I'll say is --

314
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
doesn’t it feel also 
that the Jews in diaspora,

315
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
or the centralized, 
ones in the US,

316
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,800
it still feels pretty fragmented. 
Now, you have a strong

317
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,800
centralization of Jews in, 
let’s say, New York.

318
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,800
And then, you have in Palo Alto. 
And you have maybe north --

319
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,800
so, do you consider 
that centralized

320
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
or is that also -- 
because the distance from

321
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,800
here to New York 
is just as great as, you know,

322
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
from Israel to London.

323
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,800
It’s true. But those distances 
are breaking down now

324
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
because of the ability to do 
exactly what you and I

325
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
are doing right now. 
And that speaks to

326
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
what I think is 
the last biggest trend,

327
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,000
science and technology. 
The massive pace

328
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,800
and speed of science and technology 
are changing everything.

329
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Look, you and I 
can have this conversation

330
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,000
even though we’re just 
a couple of miles away

331
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
from each other. 
Or we could do this

332
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
with folks in Israel. 
You can have a

333
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,800
Charedi woman and a secular man,

334
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
or vice versa actually talking 
like this now

335
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,800
right across time zones, 
across mechitza.

336
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,000
You can have age. No, it goes 
away all of a sudden.

337
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So, yes, there is a central 
place here in Palo Alto,

338
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,800
and a central place in New York 
but we’re breaking down

339
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
these barriers now. 
And so, think about

340
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,800
how we can now 
have real Talmud study

341
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,000
with the chavruta 
that’s sitting thousands

342
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and thousands of miles away. 
Okay, think about

343
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,800
how science and technology 
are changing things.

344
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
So, it’s not just 
the Shabbat’s elevator

345
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,800
in Jerusalem, Michael, 
but what if Tesla allows

346
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,800
for a Shabbat’s car. 
So, now we can drive on Shabbats.

347
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,900
Imagine if -- they’re now figuring
out how to make these

348
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,800
impossible burgers 
and these plant-based meat.

349
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,800
So, imagine now that we 
can have actually kosher pork

350
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,800
and kosher bacon. 
Science is changing everything

351
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,800
and those are the small things. 
But imagine the big things as well.

352
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,000
Imagine when virtual reality

353
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
allows us to actually 
stand at the base

354
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,700
of Mt. Sinai and experience 
revelation for ourselves. Right?

355
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,800
So, time goes away. 
Space goes away.

356
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
Science and technology 
is changing everything

357
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,800
and those are the positive 
trends, but it can also

358
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,800
have a dark side as well. 
For example, the genetic testing.

359
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
If somebody says, 
“Well, you can now test

360
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
whether you are 
genetically Jewish or not,

361
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,000
and that means you’re 
either in or you’re out,

362
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,800
I could see that going in a very, 
very dark and scary [unclear].

363
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,000
No. And obviously, 
I mean in Israel,

364
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,800
there’s a bunch 
of different conflicts.

365
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,000
in Tel-Aviv just recently, 
they very recently announced

366
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,800
that gay couples 
can declare themselves married

367
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
and get the benefits 
of being married,

368
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,800
which is a huge, 
huge incredible feat

369
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,000
that they managed 
to get through, finally.

370
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
But I’m also witnessing in Israel 
that there is a greater conflict

371
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,800
emerging between secular Jews
and religion Jews within Israel,

372
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,800
between the regular citizens, 
and then the Karaites.

373
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
And one of the amazing things 
that I’ve been observing

374
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,800
through technology 
and such is Moshe Friedman

375
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
from Bnei Brak. 
[unclear] already.

376
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,800
He brings on this amazing group 
of Karaite technology enthusiasts

377
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,000
and creates this 
venture capital arm in

378
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,800
Bnei Brak, bringing together 
also people from Tel-Aviv

379
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
and creating this mishmash, 
and showing that,

380
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
yes, we’re actually 
not that different.

381
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Sure, one eats pork. 
The other one doesn’t.

382
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,800
But we’re all the same 
people at the end.

383
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,000
And I think it’s beautiful. 
Zack, we have

384
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,800
just a few minutes left. 
I want to get your mind

385
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,000
about leadership a little bit 
because you have dozens of years

386
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,800
of experience with leadership. 
And I’d love to get your point

387
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
on leadership as a whole.

388
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Thank you, Michael. 
And it’s been a great conversation.

389
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
I love the way 
that you’ve made this happen.

390
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,000
It’s very grassroots 
and it’s very indicative

391
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,800
of what’s going to happen 
in this next generation.

392
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
- Right? No longer
- Thank you.

393
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
do you have to have somebody
heckschering you,

394
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,800
blessing you, saying, 
“You are now a leader; therefore,

395
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,000
you get to interview whomever." 
It’s going to come up

396
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,800
and bubble up organically, 
grassroots the way you have.

397
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
- So, I love that you’re 
- Thank you.

398
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
an example of this.

399
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
And thank you for inviting me 
to be a part of this conversation.

400
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Look, leadership takes 
all forms as we know.

401
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,000
And people talk about 
peace time leaders

402
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,800
and war time leaders, 
peace time CEOs,

403
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,000
war time CEOs. 
And you have to take on

404
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,800
different personality types 
for different environments.

405
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,800
I think about what 
a real leader has to do

406
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
and what a real leader 
doesn’t have to do.

407
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,800
And I have this acronym. 
It just happens to be

408
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,800
the word scaffolding. 
I think a real strong leader

409
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,800
has to offer the scaffolding 
and allow the rest of his

410
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,800
or her team to do the rest. 
And what does

411
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,000
this scaffolding entail? 
The S, you have

412
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
to offer the strategy. 
How can you be

413
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
the one thinking about 
what it’s going to take

414
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,800
to achieve the goals 
of the organization?

415
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,800
The C, you have to change 
the culture and set the culture.

416
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
And determine, are you going to 
micromanage or you can give people

417
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
a lot of freedom. 
Is it going to be a culture

418
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,800
of shared leadership or not, okay?
I think the A is the architecture.

419
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
What does this setup 
of the organization look like?

420
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
What does the org chart look like? 
Who reports to whom? Right?

421
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,800
F, focus. You have to provide 
the focus so that people

422
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,800
are not wandering off. 
But you also have to allow people

423
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
a little bit of autonomy in that.

424
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
- Right.
- The second F is forecasting.

425
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
You have to be 
able to see the future.

426
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,000
Right? People are looking for 
what is the future.

427
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
What's right around the bend? 
Some of the questions you asked me.

428
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Right? The O is for oversight 
and determining what oversight.

429
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,800
Are you going to measure 
daily metrics, weekly KPIs,

430
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,800
monthly, quarterly? 
What does that look like?

431
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,000
Right? The L is for leadership, 
okay? Leadership development.

432
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,800
And that’s not just kind of 
like the generic way,

433
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
but who are you 
looking to in the future

434
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,800
to bring onto your 
board of directors

435
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,300
to be your next round of investors? 
Right? Who’s your kitchen cabinet?

436
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
That’s leadership development.

437
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
So, not just a one-man show, 
but who are the people

438
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,300
that are going to help you 
and help the whole

439
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,300
organization lead with you.

440
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,300
Right, exactly. 
I is inspiration.

441
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,300
In many ways, the CEO 
has to be the CIO,

442
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,900
the Chief Inspiration Officer. 
Right? The N is for networkt

443
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,300
because you are the guy at the top 
or the woman at the top

444
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,300
and you are the only one 
who could talk to other leaders

445
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,300
at that level. 
So, you are the one who keeps

446
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,300
that network in your own industry. 
Right? So, the network is the N.

447
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,300
And finally, the last is the G, 
which is the golden circle.

448
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,300
Simon Sinek has 
this great TED talk.

449
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,300
You’ve probably seen it 
about the golden circle.

450
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,900
Yes

451
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,300
We all have to sell for the center 
of the circle, which is the why.

452
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,300
So, you as the leader, 
have to provide the why.

453
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,300
What is the reason why you are 
doing whatever you’re doing?

454
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,300
So, that’s how I think 
about leadership.

455
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,300
And anything outside 
of that acronym,

456
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,300
I leave it to the rest of the team.

457
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,300
Zack, why are you doing 
what you’re doing?

458
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,700
Why are you the CEO 
of the JCC in Palo Alto? Why?

459
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,300
Because this is my calling. 
This is what I’m meant to do.

460
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,300
Really, this is in my kishkes.

461
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,900
It’s what I am meant to be doing 
at this time in my life.

462
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,000
I took this job. I loved AIPAC. 
I ran the Pacific Northwest region

463
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,700
of AIPAC for almost 15 years. 
I loved it. I didn’t want to leave.

464
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,000
But when somebody approached me 
about this opportunity,

465
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,300
I realized that I -- 
I actually believe

466
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,300
the next 100 years 
of American-Jewish life, Michael,

467
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,300
is going to be built 
by the Jewish out here.

468
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,300
The last 100 years 
of American-Jewish life

469
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,000
was built by East Coast Jews. 
Everything that we know

470
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,300
from the synagogue structures, 
the legacy institutions.

471
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,700
New York Jewish deli 
defined our food, right?

472
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,300
Jewish humor came 
from the Borscht Belt

473
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,300
in Broadway. 
But the next 100 years

474
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
of American-Jewish life, 
it's going to be built

475
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,300
by the Jewish out here 
because they have the resources.

476
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,300
They are the ones 
who are disenfranchised

477
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,700
with the way that we used to do 
Jewish and they want

478
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,300
to change it up. 
And they have the willingness

479
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,700
to break glass, move fast, 
think like Silicon Valley

480
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,300
entrepreneurs. 
So, those three things

481
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,300
mean that these Jews out here 
are going to create

482
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,300
the next generation 
of Jewish life.

483
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,300
They may not know it yet, 
but I want to be a part of

484
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,300
that conversation. 
I want to help them think

485
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,700
about what it means to do that. 
That’s why I’m in this role.

486
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,300
I love it. I love it. Zack,
 last question,

487
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,300
the most important one. 
I need three words

488
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,300
that you would use 
to define yourself

489
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,300
or any of your colleagues 
at the JCC or AIPAC

490
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,300
would use to define Zack Bodner.

491
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,300
Good question. 
I think passionate,

492
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,300
as you could probably hear from me. 
I’m passionate about life,

493
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,300
about the causes 
that I attach myself to,

494
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,300
about the people in my world. 
So, number one is passionate.

495
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,300
I think number two is genuine. 
I always have to be myself

496
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,300
even if that means 
sharing bad news

497
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,300
as I’ve had to do this last week 
with the changes that are coming

498
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,700
at the JCC because 
of our budget situation.

499
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,300
Yeah.

500
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:46,000
And I think, finally, 
the last word I would use

501
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,300
to describe myself is gregarious. 
I’m a people person.

502
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,300
I like to be out there. 
I like to engage. I like to --

503
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,300
which is why this lockdown 
and the social distancing

504
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,300
is so hard for me 
in particular, right?

505
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,300
This way of connecting is great,

506
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,000
but it doesn’t replace -- 
I want to give you a hug, Michael.

507
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,300
I want to just be able to sit 
and break bread with you.

508
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,000
I want to share a drink with you. 
And so, being the

509
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,300
gregarious extrovert that I am, 
it’s very hard for me

510
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,300
in this situation. 
But I think those are,

511
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,300
at least, some of the words 
I would use to describe myself.

512
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,300
I love it. Zack, 
thank you so, so much.

513
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,300
I love that you’re on 
Jabotinsky suite right now.

514
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,300
[laughs]

515
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,300
- Thank you.
- Really phenomenal.

516
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,300
And thank you for the inspiration 
and for the time.

517
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,300
I learned so much.

518
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,300
- So, thank you for that.
- Thank you, Michael.

519
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,700
Appreciate you inviting me.

520
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,300
Thank you and I’ll see you 
at the JCC one day

521
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,300
- when corona is over.
- One day.

522
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,300
One day, God-willing.

523
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,300
- Take care.
- All right. Take care.

524
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,300
- Thanks, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
