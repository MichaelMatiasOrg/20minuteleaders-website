1 Even if you get higher education, no, almost no major can actually prepare you to today's job market and and workplaces. Those are the place that kind of give you the skills and teach you the hands on. Noa Ohayon Bab, thank you so much for taking time out of your busy schedule to be with me. How are you? Great. I'm really happy and excited to join you today. Thank you very, very much. Noah, if I begin to list the different things that you've done, the 20 minutes would be fast over. But just for reference, so that we can structure the conversation a little bit. You're running marketing for a startup, Colu. You're head of community for then for eBay. Today you're the head of the Israeli delegation to Washington, DC. But you're also a speechwriter for a very famous politicians, which you managed to put in your children's names in there from time to time, right? But one of the most important things, I think, is that you competed against on a [--] on a trivia game show. We did indeed. And lost. And lost. Tell me about that experience. You're in "Who's the last standing", right? Yes. Yes, true. And I was petrified being in front of the basketball player. And I'm like, "Oh, they're going to ask me some question about sports." And if there is something I'm not good at it's sports questions. And I end up losing to a question about a book, which is my passion, my hobby, my major. You studied literature. Yes. That was very true. I would say it's not a very good one. It's not a very good book, the one that I missed. So, I'm kind of okay with losing on that one. But I love it. I love it. Noa, even when I was listing the things, and it's important for me not to have anything written because I try to be spontaneous. But I forgot to mention that you also just casually co-founded one of the leading job search platforms in Israel, which we'll get to as well. But Noa, talk to me about your life journey, because that's fascinating. You're starting out with literature. You're writing speeches for famous politicians, which I want to hear about what that's like. And then, you all of a sudden find yourself in the tech scene. So, start from the speech writing and then let's move on to the tech scene. So, if we again smoother, I actually started as an educator because like everybody else, I wanted to change the world for better. I guess I just want to make the world a better place. And they said, well, education would be "it" probably, right? Especially in Israel when you have so many minority groups and such a huge gap in between certain populations. So, I said, "Okay, I'm going to deep dive into that." My original kind of ambition would be like the minister of education. And then I said, "A teacher would be a good start." I'd say. And I thought that would be the most effective way. Everybody goes through the education system, at the same time, also working in the big philanthropy organization with students, that came from disadvantaged background, kind of enabled them to get higher education and get the best out of that time period. And while I was doing all that, for sure impact, I still felt that I was kind of restrained in between these literally four walls sometimes. And I felt that if I in person want to get a jump start, but also with the impact, I want to create, tech would be it. It's this is the way to go. If we want to prepare the generation of the future, we should definitely skill them up with those areas. And I felt that would be the best thing to do. And because I had that social media as a non-profit startup, I'd say, I was pretty good with everything related to social media and online marketing. And so, that was kind of my ticket to make that transition. But I do have to say, Noa, I'm stumped for a second because that's exactly the point that I keep thinking about. It's about, while you just talked about what was the scale, right? You're saying, I'm making an impact, it's between four walls. Every minute that I put into a day, you can pretty much know, okay, this is the impact that I'm producing. And how do I now make this impact at scale so that I can impact millions of people? And I'm sure that the work that you were doing with the students physically in front of you, you changed their lives. But then you would think, okay, how can I now do this at scale and change millions of people's lives, right? Yeah, exactly. So, scaling is it, you know. Tech and scale is that so. It's kind of doing automation of impact, I would say. And so, that kind of that's how I made the transition into tech. Obviously this can be a whole conversation to itself because I know many people have that kind of ambition to do that transition to both ways. I get it out of course from people who want to do the other way around. And also, it's there's the language, it's not just the language. Translating your resume from, let's say, Hebrew to English. It's translating your resume from English to tackle whatever language it is. And each sector has its own lingo, and kind of in a world. It's like classic with our minister of technology moving from VC to the public sector. But you're right, the transition is both ways. But yeah. Sorry, I keep interrupting you. That's what I told you, I want to hear more about you than speak about myself, but will do the other around this time. And yeah, so I started off at in tech, in the FinTech startup, which was completely out of my comfort zone. And I do give a huge kudos to this startup that saw the potential in me. And it was kind of a smart move also from my end to give an opportunity to an early stage startup, because this is also kind of a tip for people who were seeking to do that transition. And it was the best school I could think of working in a startup. Especially in Israel, it's like there's 30 hours a day or 36 hours a day instead of 24. It's you learn so much. And it was literally the best school. And I do believe that employers, and also companies are the schools of today, if we mentioned education and so on. So, even if you get higher education, no, almost no major can actually prepare you to today's job market and workplaces. Those are the place to kind of give you the skills and teach you the hands-on work. So, yeah, so that was kind of the first step. And all along I kept on having my job search platform, which I co-founded with a friend named Dana. And yeah, which also kind of made it very loud and clear because I was talking to job seekers to thousands and tens of thousands and even more of job seekers, but at the same times to employers. And I could see very clearly kind of this gap between you write your resume, hope for the best, do whatever you can to put yourself into words, and then you send them out and hope that someone gets them. But we all know that even if they get them, they get a chance to read so few of them. So, that's kind of definitely a market disruption that I care a lot about. And obviously, I have to say that you're being very humble by just saying that you co-founded this platform. This is one of the most popular platforms in Israel for job searching with hundreds of thousands of visitors per month and tens of thousands of active engagements. And we're talking about here people's lives, people's livelihoods. This is not just another product. This is literally finding people jobs. For some people, it's to get food on the table. For others, it's for different fulfillment. So, that's incredible. Noa, you moved from Colu to eBay. And now you're about community and you're about engagement. What does that mean to you? So, first of all, thank you so for putting that in such good wording, because people keep on asking. I've been doing it for over than 10 years and we have a group of seven volunteers and people are like, why are you doing it? We do it voluntarily. We don't, we're not for this. Amazing. We're not getting paid. And when people ask me, "Do you not feeling...?" In Hebrew there's a special word for it, fry or fly, which means: do you not feel like you could get you're able to get so much money out of this? And I'm like, I want to make sure I keep it free for both sides. So people, so organization will be more than happy to send us as many jobs as possible, especially during covid. At the same time, we're going to keep it free for those who are job seeking. And we all know that that can be the toughest time out of someone's lives. Yeah. So, if you're actually about community, so, you know, this is pretty smooth because if we're talking about community, I guess it's exactly it. It's being able to, in a way to advance your life. And I do think when you talk about online communities and Facebook and social media, many of the times you would hear people criticize it and say it's shallow and it's a waste of time and it's only self bragging and so on. And I do believe that we can use social media and even online marketing to benefit our life, to become better parents. I get a ton of advice. I'm sure I'm a better mom since I've been using mom groups and parents groups online, and it makes us better professionals. And honestly, it's just it's I do believe this is the way to go. And if you talk about companies and tech companies, I think for everyone it is very clear that old days, marketing, the one that you think of a slogan of a catch phrase, you think of the best image, it's just not enough. None of us is going to make enough vision of what cell phone to buy because they have Galgadot, which I love. Yeah, I don't want to [--]. All of us do. But it's just not enough. I'm not going to get someone just because they have an amazingly beautiful face on it. I'm going to do it because, because I'm going to find this blog or just a friend or a Facebook group that I appreciate and I'm going to search and I'm going to see some reviews and make up my mind based on that more than anything else. And this goes for honestly, almost everything you do if you think about it. And also studies shows that 40% of the consumer choice we made are based on ear to mouth. And this is how we make our choices today. And that's why reviews are so big. And so many startups and companies are around reviews. But at the same time, community and consumer community or a product community, this is honestly this is the way you go. And eBay, the boss I had, which is also a funny story, he heard me interviewed on another podcast about online communities. And when the site in Israel wanted to try and kind of put up a team for that, they were looking for a team leader. And so, he heard me on that podcast and so he reached out. And it was so funny because it was exactly that they wanted to do this experiment where they take their users, their product users around a certain area and kind of build the community around it and see how we curate products better, how we create an inner community. Let's say, if it's buyers on eBay or Amazon, how do you create their own inner community to share your problem, best practices and so on. That is fascinating. I think that what you said before, which really resonated with me, you said that the pretty face and the logo and the message, is it's not enough. And I hear some people say that that branding and marketing has changed. I don't think the change is about it. What you're saying is it's evolved, right? It is still important. It's still important to have the great people presenting it. The messaging is important, the logo is important. But now for me to want to buy a cell phone, to for me to want to engage with the product, I need something more. I need to feel a part of the community. And I think that that's just something fascinating that really feels like it's something out of the last five or six years, right? That it's really becoming more and more common, which is, I think, incredible. But I want to make sure we have enough time also to talk about what you're doing today. Because today you're talking from Washington DC, right? Yes. What are you doing there? Yeah, basically kind of the same, but just different. The idea is to have a Israel representative live here in America, working with the community here in America and kind of working on the connection between Israel and working on that relationship to kind of make it more depth than what you hear on the news and on social media. So, this is kind of depict the deep relationship in between. And, yeah, I'm leading a group here and also moved here with my family on this adventure. Again, following passion, I guess. And I definitely love doing that. And I do believe that in some aspects we can definitely, some aspects and best practices, we can bring from outside of the country here to America and definitely learn from different cultures. I can say that Facebook groups in Israel are so big. Studies show that people in Israel spend their time, at least in two or three Facebook group and really consumer, but also for every other aspect in their life. And when we had a session or a committee of people who lead big community groups and communities online through Facebook. So, we met there GM of Israel and she said that Israel is really the kind of the top of that pyramid with innovation around kind of committee. I guess, because, you know, it's a good sandbox with those things. It's a small place. Everybody knows everyone. And definitely, yeah. So again, you're taking community. But you're going from tech now back to community. And I'm guessing that there is a little bit of a difference between running the community and engagement for a startup, then for a big corporation and now for more of the government and more for social issues, right? Yeah. And even maybe, even diplomate in a way. But I can tell you that throughout the last decade that I've been doing it in different aspects, you can see that some of the essence run the same. I mean, people want to find their peers or people they can relate to. They want to get knowledgeable from those areas. And I'd say I think kind of a difference between a non-community or a community is kind of, or between the old marketing and the new marketing will be around two things: one of them would be that the communication is both ways. It's not just a company or organization or a social cause shouting out their message, it goes both ways. And that one I can speak very close from working in a startup because you have your roadmap. And the product team have their plans and not want to hear any feedback from up the street. And kind of make a good buddy from work a good community manager and a more advanced marketer. You would bring that information back to the team. I can give you just a tiny example. When I work for PolyPay, it's a payment app like Venmo. And it was new. Five years ago in Israel, no one used a payment app. I remember. I remember when it was brand new. Yeah. Yeah. So, okay. So thank you. You probably got tons of emails from me. You know from Colu, it was me. And I said no one used it and we had to educate the market. And so we asked people, why don't you feel confident? We ask, what's kind of your feedback? And many of them said they don't feel confident enough to put in their credit card information. And so we just added the symbol, that icon of lock. And even that just increased the trust in maybe 30% when it happened. And it's just a tiny example of how feedback from users can really change your product and your everything. And so that's one major thing, the two sides of communication. And the other thing is, to create a space for people to communicate with each other. And that also was a good thing. Because if you're talking about a tech product, you would say, why is it important to ask? But we even just spread by widening focus group, they have an opportunity to talk users where they get the opportunity to communicate between themselves, you can actually create not just users, but passionate community members of your own product. And many before me, Yelp, they build their, that's basically how they build themselves up, bottom up. Noa, it's just fascinating. It's so, so relevant to everything that's happening today and the whole evolution of the company's brand engagement community, it's just fascinating work that you're doing. And I just love how you are getting all these different, extraordinary experiences. Half of which we didn't even get to really dive deep in and talk about. And that's why I keep beating myself on the head that I that I called this, 20 Minute Leaders and not 30 minute leaders. Because oftentimes I just want to continue. But unfortunately, I have to now thank you for being so generous with your time. And I have to ask you the last question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. So, I would say the first one would probably be passion. I hope it goes through it. I am passionate in everything I do, I'd say probably the second thing would be community. It's something I care a lot through everything I do. And the third one, which I had the hardest time choosing, maybe because it's the last one, I'd say maybe adjustable or kind of- Yeah. Yeah. Being- Dynamic. Adjustable. Yeah. Because, you know, people translate what Darwin said. And they sometimes you hear someone said that he said that the stronger survives. But if you look closely at the translation, it says, that it was more adaptive that's who survives. And I think that's kind of our generation and our future generation, and the reality that we live today, being adaptive and being able to adjust to whatever comes your way, that's kind of the way to survive, I guess. But also to enjoy, not just surviving. Yeah. Noah, toda raba. Thank you so, so much. This was just wonderful. Thank you for the incredible work that you're doing, whether it's helping thousands of people find jobs or helping spread the message of Israel in a better light and in a more correct light with actual deep meaning. And not just headlines from either sides. And I'm just looking forward to continue learning from you, from all your journey and continue maintaining this relationship. So, thank you very much. Same here. Thank you so much.
