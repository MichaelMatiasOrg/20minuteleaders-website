1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,080
So, I went there,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,400
I was hunting with the warriors.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,240
I was gathering with the warriors.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,720
Then they made me queen

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,360
and married me to the warrior.

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,700
To the best warrior.

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,200
Sarah Begum, thank you so much

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,400
for joining me, all the way

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,280
from the United Kingdom.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,400
How are you?

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,920
I'm good. Thanks, Matias.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,640
How are you?

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,080
Thanks for having me.

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,000
Thank you very, very much for being here.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,120
I really appreciate you taking the time.

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,960
You know, between all the traveling,

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,640
I don't know how much of that

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,280
you've been able to do during covid.

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,680
But, through all these extraordinary

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,640
experiences that you've had,

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,880
I'm especially curious

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,440
as young entrepreneur on my journey,

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,720
I'm trying to discover

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,080
what are different cultures in the world,

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,560
where there are different

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,000
experiences people are having.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,960
And I can't think of anybody better

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,280
to tell me about these

29
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,120
extraordinary experiences than you.

30
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,720
So, Sarah, why am I so excited

31
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,720
to speak to you?

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,440
I'll let you tell them yourself.

33
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,240
Okay. So, I have travelled

34
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,680
to remote parts of the world,

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,640
living with indigenous tribes

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,480
and capturing their stories.

37
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,240
I've also survived dangerous places

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,120
such as the murder capital of the world,

39
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,360
slums and mostly undercover

40
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,560
to tell those stories, too.

41
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,800
So, we're going to have to spend

42
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,960
the majority of the time

43
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,680
hearing those stories,

44
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,640
because myself nor my friends

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,120
have gotten to be undercover in slums

46
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,360
and the murder capital of the world.

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,520
So, tell me first a little bit

48
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,400
about your entrepreneurial

49
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,600
and adventurous self.

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,360
Where does that passion for traveling

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,920
and finding those crazy adventures,

52
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,640
what did that stem?

53
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,880
Where does that come from?

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,960
Okay. So, growing up, I grew up

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,680
in a very multicultural environment

56
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,400
with friends from all over the world,

57
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,240
different cultures.

58
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,240
And I was always curious.

59
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,520
And I was curious about the world,

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,320
what else is out there.

61
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,160
At the age of nine,

62
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,640
I learned about deforestation

63
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,680
in the Amazon.

64
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,640
And it became my dream

65
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,480
to go there and save the trees,

66
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,600
and also to visit these tribes.

67
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,520
And at the age of 21,

68
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,040
I was studying television film

69
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,680
and journalism at a BA HONs

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,920
at a university.

71
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:38,000
But I didn't want to be

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,080
just another graduate

73
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,280
in a sea of other graduates.

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,320
I wanted to stand out from the crowd.

75
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,760
And so, during my final year,

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,840
I took a month out

77
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,120
to make my own film.

78
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,280
I won an award

79
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,640
that helped fund the ticket there.

80
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,120
I used my life savings

81
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,560
and also the university's resources,

82
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,280
take note.

83
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,320
And I decided

84
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,680
to follow my childhood dream.

85
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,560
So, I found a cameraman

86
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,160
from New York,

87
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,720
someone from Portsmouth

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,880
and an indigenous tribe

89
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,280
who lived primitively till this day.

90
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,080
And I just went there.

91
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,920
I planned the whole thing,

92
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,280
obviously, six months in advance.

93
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,320
And my goal was always

94
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,240
to make it a commercial piece.

95
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:24,800
My goal was also to get it

96
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,320
in the Cannes Film Festival.

97
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,280
So, I went there.

98
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:31,600
I was hunting with the warriors.

99
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,480
I was gathering with the warriors.

100
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,960
Then they made me queen

101
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,600
and married me to the warrior.

102
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
To the best warrior.

103
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:40,519
To the best warrior.

104
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,120
I didn't know what was happening.

105
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,680
I was thinking, "Wait a minute.

106
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,320
I thought they were just making me queen."

107
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,000
Because they had

108
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,040
to strip me naked as well

109
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,720
and make me one of them.

110
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,000
So, I became one of the tribe.

111
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,200
And that was actually

112
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,360
to create an alliance

113
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,840
so that I would spread their message

114
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,080
about protecting their land

115
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,200
from exploitation, because

116
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,722
there's a large oil reserve

117
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:01,680
where they live.

118
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,960
And they've had years

119
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,960
of fighting against the oil companies

120
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,280
to preserve their land

121
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,680
and the jungle and their home.

122
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,960
So, when I got back,

123
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,120
I finished my degree.

124
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,440
And then, I started working in TV.

125
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,320
I was taking under the wing

126
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,440
of a prominent film directors

127
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,341
and producers.

128
00:04:24,342 --> 00:04:26,275
That one of Bear Grylls directors,

129
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:27,040
my role model,

130
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,680
Bruce Parry, contacted me.

131
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,320
That gave me hope.

132
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,560
And then eventually,

133
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,080
I managed to finish making this film,

134
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,080
this TV style, half hour documentary.

135
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:39,560
And I was the youngest person

136
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,360
ever to do that, to live with a tribe

137
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,760
and make a first film.

138
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,600
And funny enough,

139
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,840
as soon as I made this film,

140
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,640
it was accepted

141
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,240
into the Cannes Film Festival,

142
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,280
and that's where it premiered.

143
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
And it has been,

144
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,080
I'm still making royalties from it today.

145
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,640
So, it was acquired by Schultz TV

146
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,760
and many other online

147
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,320
broadcasting companies.

148
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,600
And yeah.

149
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,440
Talk about following your dreams, right?

150
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:06,880
Yeah.

151
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,680
Follow your dreams.

152
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,360
But that also made me realize

153
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,200
that this is what I want to do.

154
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,200
I didn't realize I was an explorer

155
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
and anthropologist, a journalist,

156
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,520
I had no idea because

157
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,840
I wanted to direct

158
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,720
the next godfather, you know,

159
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,040
and that didn't happen.

160
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,160
It just, life just took a different turn.

161
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:26,520
And I wanted to do something meaningful

162
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,560
with purpose in my life.

163
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,400
I just found it so exciting

164
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,320
going to these remote parts of the world,

165
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,840
learning about how these people live

166
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,080
and just giving them a voice.

167
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,920
And it helps them, it also helps me

168
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,320
because I feel fulfilled.

169
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,760
And over the years,

170
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,240
that's what I've been doing.

171
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,742
And jungles, I've been

172
00:05:46,743 --> 00:05:48,960
to the Brazilian jungle as well,

173
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,600
and the Atlas Mountains of Morocco,

174
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,400
with the Native Americans

175
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,080
in the USA.

176
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,640
I did a road trip in three weeks,

177
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,680
18 states on reservations,

178
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,560
powwows everywhere.

179
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,760
In deserts, in the Jordanian desert,

180
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,160
the Wadi Rum desert

181
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,240
with the Bedouin tribe.

182
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,400
The Chai tribe in Ghana,

183
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
where I lived for years,

184
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,800
as an investigative journalist.

185
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:10,808
A year.

186
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,520
Yeah.

187
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,280
Wait, I have to hear about this,

188
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,920
with the Chai tribe in Ghana for a year.

189
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,760
What is that like?

190
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
So, I lived in Ghana for a year

191
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,360
as an investigative journalist

192
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,880
and I was with the Chai tribe.

193
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,280
I was the only British woman

194
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,000
at the time when they were showing me

195
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,680
the [--] festival, to commemorate

196
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,480
when the British

197
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,920
kicked them out of their hilltop homes

198
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,720
because they thought

199
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,840
they were committing human sacrifice.

200
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,920
It was really interesting.

201
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,960
They were calling upon their ancestors.

202
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,600
And we went to various sacred spots

203
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,960
for libation and prayer and chanting.

204
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,320
And it was really interesting,

205
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,200
really interesting.

206
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,880
Almost like a pilgrimage.

207
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,960
And so, I documented that.

208
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,560
By the way,

209
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,960
when you go and document

210
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,240
as an investigative journalist,

211
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,040
so you're both an explorer,

212
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,320
from what it sounds to me,

213
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,880
it's like you actually become one

214
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,200
of their own, right?

215
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,280
I mean, you marry a warrior

216
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,560
right in their own ceremony

217
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,720
and make an alliance with them,

218
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,200
and then you go

219
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,800
and you immerse yourself

220
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,760
in the culture

221
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,600
and of the Chai tribe in Ghana,

222
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,440
spending years of

223
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,600
an investigative journalist there,

224
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,720
but then also going

225
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,440
to all these different cultures.

226
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,640
And so, tell me a little bit about

227
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,160
this immersive experience

228
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,520
that you're having there.

229
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,472
Because, I'm imagining

230
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:32,640
that you're not just there

231
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,320
as a journalist with a microphone

232
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,560
and a camera all the time, right?

233
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,600
You're actually experiencing

234
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,040
what they're doing.

235
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,280
So, I don't always like,

236
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:40,560
I know that the camera's there,

237
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,680
but I'm not focusing on the camera.

238
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,400
When I'm there, I'm with them.

239
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,320
I focus on them.

240
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,280
And it's about human connection.

241
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,320
So, you have to connect

242
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,320
with them in an authentic way.

243
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,280
And I believe by immersing yourself

244
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,240
in a culture but completely letting go

245
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,480
with any preconceived ideas

246
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,120
or beliefs or values,

247
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,680
you get a genuine

248
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,560
and true depiction of their culture

249
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,240
and who they are

250
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,680
and how they live.

251
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,480
And that creates understanding

252
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,000
between you and their culture.

253
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,040
And then you're able to portray that

254
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,840
in a very honest way,

255
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,560
you know, and a very genuine way.

256
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,320
And I think if we all

257
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,040
were able to do that,

258
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,640
instead of having all these judgments

259
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,974
about cultures before

260
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:27,640
experiencing them ourselves

261
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,600
and before communicating with people

262
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,200
on a very honest level, you know,

263
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,240
then we'll learn how to respect others.

264
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,520
We can respect one another

265
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,240
and that creates diplomacy,

266
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
and that creates peace.

267
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,040
100%.

268
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,000
So, I completely agree.

269
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,320
I think it starts with a dialogue.

270
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,160
Before the dialogue,

271
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,080
it starts with respect

272
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,520
and truly respecting

273
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,040
and acknowledging

274
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,440
the other person's way of life,

275
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,280
which is different than

276
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,960
your way of life.

277
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,240
Yeah, but how can you respect

278
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,840
what you don't know?

279
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,400
Right.

280
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,040
What you don't understand, you know.

281
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,000
So, by having an immersive experience,

282
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,280
you learn to understand.

283
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,560
And by understanding,

284
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,640
you then develop that respect.

285
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:13,840
Right.

286
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,640
So, before we get to talking about,

287
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,280
you know, the different experiences

288
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,600
that you've had,

289
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,680
I have to hear about,

290
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,720
you know, being in the slums

291
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,240
and being undercover also

292
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,080
in the murder capital of the world.

293
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,560
But talk to me a little bit about,

294
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,080
but I have to hear your thoughts

295
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,280
a little bit about the impact.

296
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,160
And at the end,

297
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,800
you're going through

298
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,120
these immersive experiences

299
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,320
and obviously you're documenting

300
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,640
and showing them with the world.

301
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,080
And one of the insights

302
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,520
I hear from you is

303
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,880
in order to really respect

304
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,320
and really acknowledge their existence

305
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,480
and their, you know,

306
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,000
our joint livelihood,

307
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,520
we first have to know

308
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,520
and understand what they are like. Right?

309
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,720
And it's very hard to do that

310
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,520
when we're not

311
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,600
immersing ourselves with them.

312
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,160
So, how can we,

313
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,960
as a civilization, come together

314
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,560
without actually, you know,

315
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,400
without each person being able to go

316
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,520
and immerse themselves with,

317
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,160
you know, the Chai tribe in Ghana?

318
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,640
Watch documentaries.

319
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,160
When you see, I mean,

320
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,600
we live in a country

321
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,920
and in a world where

322
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,840
we are very lucky to meet people

323
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,240
from other parts of the world, you know.

324
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,160
Our neighbors are different from us.

325
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,360
Our colleagues are different from us.

326
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,400
Have the time

327
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,000
to maybe ask them questions

328
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,120
about their background,

329
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,360
about their cultures, you know,

330
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,040
maybe what kind of music they listen to.

331
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,400
What was the story

332
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,080
of that artist that they really like

333
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,000
from Senegal,

334
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,200
and just learn about them.

335
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,240
So, ask questions

336
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,480
that show that you really actually care

337
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,520
about them as a person

338
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,640
and what's unique about them.

339
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,400
Because when you ask questions,

340
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,160
then you learn

341
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,000
and then you develop that connection

342
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,960
and understanding.

343
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,760
And who knows,

344
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,960
it deepens your friendship

345
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,600
or your working relationship,

346
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,440
whatever the relationship maybe.

347
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,840
And also, watch documentaries,

348
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,240
read up about those.

349
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,200
So many different ways to explore

350
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,360
and understand and learn

351
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,880
without going anywhere.

352
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,640
And do you really think

353
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,720
that watching documentaries

354
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,880
and exploring online

355
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,640
without having that personal connection,

356
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,160
is that enough?

357
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,320
Well, I'm talking about in a pandemic,

358
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,160
thing in a pandemic,

359
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,720
you can speak on Zoom,

360
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,760
you can interact with people

361
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,040
all over the world on the Internet.

362
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,000
That's why the Internet

363
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,400
has been very useful.

364
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,760
One thing I'd like to mention about

365
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,640
the Internet is,

366
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,680
my warriors are on Facebook.

367
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,760
And they messaged me all the time.

368
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,680
Now, when they first started calling me

369
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,840
and Skyping me

370
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,560
and sending me email, I mean,

371
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,218
I was like," Wow."

372
00:11:47,219 --> 00:11:49,520
"They use email. They use the Internet.

373
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,679
This is so cool."

374
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,200
But it's a great way

375
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,600
of staying connected to them.

376
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,720
And for them,

377
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,400
it's a great way of teaching

378
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,240
the world about their culture.

379
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,480
Right.

380
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,400
And, you know,

381
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,160
sending their message themselves.

382
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,560
It gives them an authentic platform.

383
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,160
So, I do think we need

384
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,156
to make use of

385
00:12:09,157 --> 00:12:11,440
all the different types of apps

386
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,720
and online education available to us.

387
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,400
However, I believe that nothing

388
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
beats human connection.

389
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,720
So, at the moment, I mean,

390
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,727
I don't want to say anything

391
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:26,118
that will make you

392
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:28,280
break the rules, broke down rules.

393
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,320
But after lockdown,

394
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,880
whenever that may be,

395
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,520
it would be great for you to travel

396
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,200
and learn about other cultures

397
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,840
through participation,

398
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,120
through observation,

399
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,840
through experiences.

400
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,920
And if you can't do that at the moment,

401
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,000
think about who there is at home.

402
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,840
Even your friends,

403
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,280
maybe you haven't asked them

404
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,880
a question that maybe you

405
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,000
didn't think about until now.

406
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,480
And if they're from a different culture,

407
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,280
a different background,

408
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,080
maybe you can go

409
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,720
and after this, after listening to this,

410
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,600
ask them those questions about them.

411
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,080
Maybe you'll learn something.

412
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,240
Who knows.

413
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,080
I can't wait to go

414
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,040
and practice this myself.

415
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,000
I've been thinking for a long time

416
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,160
about the things that I want to be doing.

417
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,560
And what one of those things

418
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,880
is using technology

419
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,080
to make a positive impact.

420
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,040
And that's on all over the world.

421
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,520
But it's very, very hard for me

422
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,840
to understand what really needs

423
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,080
to happen to make a positive impact

424
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
in places like, let's say,

425
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,200
Africa or East Asia.

426
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,440
And I think part of it is because

427
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,120
I'm not there.

428
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,560
It's because I'm not feeling the people.

429
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,320
I'm not interacting

430
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,760
with them on a daily basis.

431
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,880
So, it's hard for me,

432
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,320
to understand really what they need

433
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,880
and how we can collaborate together.

434
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,040
And I have to also mention that

435
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,560
I've been an avid participant

436
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,160
in Burning Man.

437
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,720
And one of the main points

438
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,040
of Burning Man is inclusion,

439
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,760
diversity and understanding.

440
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,240
And there is one rule

441
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,320
that you are not allowed

442
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,480
to be a bystander.

443
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,360
You're not allowed to be a spectator.

444
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,520
You have to participate

445
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,720
in whatever you do.

446
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,200
So, if you see something happening,

447
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,600
you're not allowed

448
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,440
to stand there and watch.

449
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,280
You have to actually go in the circle

450
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,120
and take an active part.

451
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,040
And that's one of the scariest,

452
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,240
but also most fun things for me in that.

453
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,560
Sarah, we have about five minutes left

454
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,480
and I'd love to hear from you

455
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,720
some more stories about

456
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,040
your immersive experience.

457
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,560
Because I want you to give me

458
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,520
this a taste of what I and my friends

459
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,160
can experience as we go

460
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,960
and travel the world

461
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,320
and immerse ourselves with these.

462
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
Where would you like to go?

463
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,120
Is there a place in mind you have?

464
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,040
Tell me a little bit about the slums.

465
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,840
About you coming from the United Kingdom

466
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,440
and immersing yourselves

467
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,800
in a culture that is

468
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,720
a little bit different, please.

469
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
Yeah. So, the first time

470
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,000
I ended up in the slums

471
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,040
in Venezuela was by accident.

472
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,560
And this was in Caracas.

473
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,320
It's the capital

474
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,720
and Petare is the name of the slums.

475
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,560
So, Petare is the largest,

476
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,640
most dangerous slums

477
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,200
in all of Latin America.

478
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,040
And I ended up there the first time

479
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,520
by accident because the road

480
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,320
was blocked to work.

481
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,600
The second time, I went undercover

482
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,520
to explore and investigate

483
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
what the conditions were like there

484
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,360
and to learn how people lived.

485
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,520
Now, I remember, I'm seeing

486
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,400
a space developed by

487
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,440
a group of students

488
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,040
from the local university there,

489
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,000
because they believed

490
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,160
by taking care of the spaces

491
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,160
and renovating them,

492
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,600
people start caring about

493
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,760
the said spaces and it reduces crime.

494
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,600
And once I was out there,

495
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,400
I was in these slum houses.

496
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:28,645
I was invited by a woman

497
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:30,134
who happened to be a friend

498
00:15:30,135 --> 00:15:31,280
of one of the teachers.

499
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,880
Now, it was so bizarre because

500
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,800
I saw like a thousand plushies everywhere.

501
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,200
It was like seven different levels

502
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,240
in terms of how many level floors

503
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,640
that were in the House.

504
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,400
There were speakers,

505
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,040
and like all the latest gadgets

506
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,760
and tech and, you know,

507
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,120
computers and music systems,

508
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,840
everything you can think of.

509
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,160
I was just so confused.

510
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,240
Because I was thinking, how?

511
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,240
Right.

512
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
What they did was

513
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,360
they sold essential goods,

514
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,600
which in the main city was hard to find

515
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,120
because of the shortages

516
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,640
caused by economic crisis.

517
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,800
And I can't believe

518
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,041
I found toilet paper here

519
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,320
and shampoo and milk and sugar

520
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,680
and all these other things

521
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,440
you couldn't find the shop in the city.

522
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,800
So, I was like, "Whoa."

523
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,320
However, they were being sold

524
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,000
about three, four, five times the price.

525
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,040
Really?

526
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah.

527
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,680
And I mean, it was just,

528
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,400
it was just bizarre.

529
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,080
Like if you watch my video

530
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,760
on my YouTube channel,

531
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,680
Surviving Caracas, you'll see.

532
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,920
And then I do some other like

533
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,560
short videos with longer,

534
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,680
longer durations of those actual scenes.

535
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah.

536
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,600
It was just really bizarre.

537
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,880
But she was nice to me

538
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,160
and she offered me some food

539
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,240
and drink and she was just so crazy.

540
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,160
She wasn't really lovely.

541
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,800
How do you even

542
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,040
get to those opportunities?

543
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,280
How do you go from the UK and said,

544
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,560
"Okay. I'm going to hop on a plane

545
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,840
and I'm going to go to Venezuela

546
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,720
and I'm going to be

547
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,560
in one of the most dangerous places

548
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,760
in the world."

549
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,200
So, that one actually

550
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,760
I was offered to be,

551
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,920
I was offered the role

552
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,920
to be a journalist and anchor,

553
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,840
a news anchor

554
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,515
for an English government channel

555
00:17:16,516 --> 00:17:19,640
based over there.

556
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,800
And I had no idea what I signed up for.

557
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,520
So, when I went there,

558
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,680
I discovered through my,

559
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,880
through realizing the lines

560
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,000
that I was expected to read on TV.

561
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,240
It was not a true depiction

562
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,680
of what was actually happening there.

563
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,680
So, I decided to make

564
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,320
a documentary undercover.

565
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,680
I went back, I made a documentary

566
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,280
about what was really happening.

567
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,960
And then I,

568
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,240
I launched that in December 2015,

569
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,440
just before the elections.

570
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,840
And the slums in Ghana,

571
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,760
that was interesting because

572
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,000
I did several stories in the slums.

573
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,240
I did one on petty crime

574
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,280
where a man was beaten up badly.

575
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,800
It was like blood flowing down

576
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,120
from his head because he refused to

577
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,760
fix the car properly.

578
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,840
Or he refused to do something

579
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,880
and it was just about fixing a car.

580
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,320
And so he was beaten up.

581
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,800
And then I just stopped him

582
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,280
and I asked him what happened.

583
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,920
And he told me and I said,

584
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,360
"Where are you going?"

585
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,707
And he said,

586
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,240
"Well, I'm going to the police station."

587
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,400
I said, "Okay. Can I come with you?"

588
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,080
He said, "Okay."

589
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,240
So, as I was walking

590
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,280
to the police station, there was,

591
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,200
I was watching him report the incident.

592
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,480
But then a man on a motorbike,

593
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,960
he was unconscious,

594
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,680
beaten unconscious,

595
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,320
sandwiched between two men

596
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,600
on this motorcycle came

597
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,000
and they were trying to frame the guy

598
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,400
who was reporting the incident.

599
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,200
It was bizarre, like, wow, what's this?

600
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,360
What's going on?

601
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,840
And also, I went into,

602
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,680
to investigate the conditions

603
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,120
of the brothels in the slums.

604
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,200
And I remember walking up

605
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
into the building

606
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,320
and almost falling through the roof.

607
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,800
Well, the floor, you know,

608
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,680
it was insane.

609
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,240
And you know, these girls,

610
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,240
they came to the city

611
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,160
from the countryside.

612
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,040
They had big dreams.

613
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,680
One of them wanted

614
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,520
to be a football player

615
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,360
because she had talent.

616
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,840
And she thought if she goes to the city,

617
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,680
she can save up money

618
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,360
or she can be spotted.

619
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,920
But that never happened.

620
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,000
She ended up in the brothel

621
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,920
and she wasn't able to leave.

622
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,800
And she was embarrassed to go back

623
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,440
because she worried

624
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,560
about what her parents would think.

625
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,160
Another one I did was, I'm investigating

626
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,640
illegal mining that, I don't really want

627
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,200
to talk about that too much.

628
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:48,160
It's like sensitive information, you know.

629
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,720
No, no, no, Sarah,

630
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,480
I have to, first thank you

631
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,560
for being so generous with your time

632
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,040
and for sharing all those experiences.

633
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,880
I think that one of the things

634
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,560
that I'm getting most inspired by

635
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,680
from this is

636
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,320
the passion and the ambition

637
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,800
to go and experience these for myself.

638
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,040
It's one thing hearing you

639
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,640
talk about them,

640
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,760
I'm sure it's a completely

641
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,720
different world being there

642
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,400
and actually immersing myself

643
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,240
and indulging myself

644
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,400
within those experiences.

645
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,200
That some of them sound

646
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,440
very uncomfortable,

647
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,760
some of them sound scary,

648
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,520
some of them sound exciting and joyful.

649
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,920
But overall, I think

650
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
it just sounds mind opening.

651
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
And so, thank you

652
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,240
for sharing that with me and thank you

653
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,520
for instilling within me now

654
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,160
this excitement, and hopefully

655
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,480
anyone else who's listening.

656
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,760
But before we leave, I have to ask you

657
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,200
the most important question,

658
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,760
which is three words that you would use

659
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,560
to describe yourself.

660
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,400
Okay, adventurous, brutally-honest.

661
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,400
Well, there's a hyphen in there.

662
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,280
Yeah.

663
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,240
And loving. I love to love.

664
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,920
I believe in love a lot.

665
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,040
I love that.

666
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,880
Sarah, thank you very, very much.

667
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,520
Stay safe and stay healthy.

668
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,120
And I can't wait to follow you

669
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,960
on the next places

670
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,320
you're going to go to the world.

671
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,760
And I can't wait

672
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
to watch these documentaries

673
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,200
because now I'm completely excited

674
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,560
about them.

675
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,240
Thank you so much, Michael.

676
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,840
I hope you do.

677
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,800
I hope you have more stories to share.

678
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,840
Thank you very, very much.
