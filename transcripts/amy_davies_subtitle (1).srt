1
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,920
All right.

2
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,440
Amy Davies, thank you so much

3
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,440
for joining me.

4
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,080
Thank you so much for having me.

5
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm really excited to do this.

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,600
I am extremely excited to do this

7
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,800
because I think that what you're doing

8
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,160
is so so relevant

9
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,400
to the unfortunate events

10
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,480
that have occurred in 2020.

11
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,160
Now, the interesting thing is that

12
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,080
I was watching a lot of the content

13
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,440
about First 30, a startup to help

14
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,080
both the onboarding

15
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,800
and outplacing of employees.

16
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,760
So, I saw, for example,

17
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,320
a video from September of 2019

18
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,640
talking about how relevant it is

19
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,480
to help people

20
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,240
as they transition to different jobs.

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,120
And then, I can't help

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,640
but reflect on March and April of 2020

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,840
with the massive layoffs

24
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,480
and how difficult that was.

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,240
And thinking that there are now

26
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,600
these platforms like First 30,

27
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,120
which make it easier,

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,280
especially emotionally

29
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,440
for the individuals,

30
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,680
not just for the company.

31
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,120
The individuals are I know, the focus,

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,520
especially in your work.

33
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,120
But before we get to that,

34
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,040
I'd love to hear a little bit about you.

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,080
Where do you come from?

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,800
I know you're in Toronto,

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,520
but where does your journey start from?

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
And how do you get to work

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,680
in the space of onboarding

40
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,440
and outplacement of employees?

41
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,080
Yeah. Well, thanks.

42
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,360
I started my journey,

43
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,680
I guess I started,

44
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,480
I studied sociology in university.

45
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,200
I was always really interested in people

46
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,320
and groups of people

47
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,800
and how they function.

48
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,160
And then, I went and moved to Europe

49
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,720
for about six years after graduation.

50
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,880
I wanted to live in a different society.

51
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,080
I wasn't brave enough to go somewhere

52
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,720
where I didn't speak the language,

53
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,800
but I did live in England.

54
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
And actually for a short time I also lived

55
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,640
in a very small town in Switzerland.

56
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,600
In Gommiswald Switzerland.

57
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,640
Yeah, I was an au pair

58
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,720
for a summer up there

59
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,120
and it was amazing.

60
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,400
But I lived and worked in England

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,000
and traveled all around Europe

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,440
a number of times, actually.

63
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,040
And I started working in market research.

64
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,840
And I actually read a book called,

65
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,880
"What Color Is Your Parachute?"

66
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,960
And that book,

67
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,480
I mean, people laughed

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,240
because it's like supposed to tell you

69
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,960
spit out what you're supposed to do.

70
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,000
And it was so accurate for me.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,960
And I got into, I actually,

72
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,640
this was an interesting story.

73
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,000
I started working at Unilever.

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,400
I was a temp employee.

75
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,280
I got that job through a friend who said,

76
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,280
"Unilever is the best place to be a temp."

77
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,360
"I'm going to get you in there."

78
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,760
So, it's great to have a good network.

79
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,040
And then I was typing menus.

80
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,120
I typed menus for the cafeteria.

81
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,400
And I did a very bad job.

82
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,360
Anyway, I really loved the company.

83
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,080
And the minute I walked in, I'm like,

84
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,880
"I belong here."

85
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,440
I love the people.

86
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,600
And I started applying for jobs

87
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,200
internally there in research.

88
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,320
So, there was a job

89
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,440
on the strategy team and I got it.

90
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,360
And actually, there was

91
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,680
a really tough competition for the job.

92
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,440
But I think it was just because,

93
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,960
and this is what I always tell people is,

94
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,040
make sure not just networking

95
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,280
with your external network,

96
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,400
but also networking internally

97
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,160
at your job.

98
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,320
So, within a few months I started work,

99
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,600
go went from typing menus

100
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,640
to doing strategy

101
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,360
for the future of the business.

102
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,600
And so, that's where it began.

103
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,640
And then over the years

104
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,240
I had different market research jobs.

105
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,140
I came back to Canada

106
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,320
and started working for companies here.

107
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,240
I worked for Rogers, for Mars Wrigley,

108
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,320
and then I also worked

109
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,440
for Grainger Canada.

110
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,560
And really enjoyed it,

111
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,480
but always had this idea

112
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,760
that I wanted to help people

113
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,960
with their careers.

114
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,120
Every business I worked with,

115
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,600
beginning with Unilever,

116
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,360
all had mass restructures

117
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,840
when I was there.

118
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,000
And I saw the emotional toll

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,120
it took on people.

120
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,760
And even the people that didn't leave,

121
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,240
having survivor's guilt, staying

122
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,560
and not really trusting

123
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,280
the organization anymore,

124
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,840
I think one big miss

125
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,640
for companies right now is that

126
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,480
there are a lot of great companies

127
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,560
take care of their people

128
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,880
that are exiting the business,

129
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,840
but they're not really thinking about

130
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,440
how to take care of the people

131
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,560
who are staying behind.

132
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,960
Who are left.

133
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,760
Yeah. Because their productivity

134
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,080
is affected, their commitment

135
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,800
to the business is affected.

136
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,840
And people fundamentally,

137
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,600
and I learned this

138
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,160
when I did market research,

139
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,080
we feel most unwell

140
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,800
and we're seeing it

141
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
with covid right now,

142
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,340
when we feel out of control

143
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,680
of our own outcome.

144
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,800
That impacts our well-being so badly.

145
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,120
And when organizations go through change,

146
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,880
what happens is people think

147
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,160
they don't have control

148
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,440
over their own outcome.

149
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,920
So, one of the most important aspects

150
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,040
of doing the type of work that I do

151
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,840
is making sure people understand

152
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,920
how they can take control back.

153
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,240
That's so fascinating,

154
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,880
I have to say that.

155
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,920
Because I was reading the other day

156
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,960
for I guess the third or fourth time

157
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,560
the letter that the CEO of Airbnb

158
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,880
sent to their employees

159
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,480
when they had the massive layoffs.

160
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,720
And I was so impressed

161
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,600
with how they were dealing

162
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,920
with the communication.

163
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,080
And over communicating

164
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,280
and making it a reasonable

165
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,680
expectation experience for the employees.

166
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,360
And I never stopped to think about

167
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,920
how it impacts the other employees

168
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,560
that are staying.

169
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,280
Since covid, all the media

170
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,960
has been talking about is how the leaders

171
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,600
are communicating externally

172
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,760
to the ones who are leaving

173
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,600
and taking care of them.

174
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,960
But I don't think there's been

175
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,280
any real coverage about how employers

176
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,640
are looking internally

177
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,560
and working on the culture.

178
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:50,840
So, I think

179
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,000
it's a really fascinating thing

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,080
that you're bringing up here.

181
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,520
Yeah. I agree with you.

182
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,040
We just assume people will just snap back.

183
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,480
But I've been through so many restructures

184
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,720
and sometimes my role has been affected.

185
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,920
It's always been affected

186
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,320
in the sense I've change teams,

187
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,520
change leadership.

188
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,360
Not always lost my job,

189
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,120
but I see that even six months,

190
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,880
a year later,

191
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,480
people still talk about that day

192
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,800
when their colleagues were laid off

193
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,640
and they have a lot of pain

194
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,920
associated with that

195
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,600
and the insecurity around it.

196
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,240
Right, right.

197
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,600
Okay. So, you've gone through

198
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,800
these mass restructurings,

199
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,400
which is obviously an inevitable part

200
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,760
of many many companies,

201
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,080
it's also a natural part

202
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,720
as companies progress and they pivot

203
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,000
and they have to change strategy.

204
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,600
And then, how do you come

205
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,840
to this idea for First 30?

206
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,560
Because companies have been onboarding

207
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,840
and outplacing employees

208
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,040
for hundreds of years, right?

209
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,240
I mean, this is the natural thing to do

210
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,280
in the company.

211
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,520
So, where does this idea come from?

212
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,280
Yeah. Well, I want to just point out

213
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,400
that I agree with you there.

214
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,880
It is natural companies

215
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,280
need to restructure.

216
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,200
So, I do believe that companies

217
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,960
need to do this.

218
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,240
And I do also believe there's right ways

219
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,480
and wrong ways to do it.

220
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,640
And I talk about a lot about the fact

221
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,360
and part of the title of my book is

222
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,440
all about living in a reorg world.

223
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,200
So, what happened with First 30 was,

224
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,480
I was put through

225
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,960
two different outplacements

226
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,240
over the course of my career.

227
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,200
And I thought,

228
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,920
"Wow, this is so great

229
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,560
to be given the service."

230
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,960
But the whole time I thought,

231
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,200
"Oh, there's something different

232
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,360
we can be doing."

233
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,240
And then, of course, I naturally did.

234
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,640
What I do best was, I started researching.

235
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
And I found out how expensive,

236
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,680
first of all, the outplacement companies

237
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,680
were for businesses.

238
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,640
So, outplacement companies

239
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,880
can charge anywhere from about

240
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,120
$3,000 to about $15,000 per employee.

241
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,880
I don't think a lot of people are aware.

242
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,400
Yes.

243
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,520
No. That's crazy. Wait.

244
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,040
But what do they do,

245
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,920
these outplacement companies?

246
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,360
What are their role in there?

247
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,680
Yeah. There's all kinds

248
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,400
of different things.

249
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,880
So, people can get together

250
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,240
for group sessions to come in

251
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,040
and have a presentation on a topic

252
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,800
like branding yourself or networking,

253
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,520
all kinds of different topics.

254
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,680
They can get their resumes reviewed.

255
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,680
They can have a coach work with them.

256
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,880
But then, so, the coaches

257
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,880
what is costing the company

258
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,760
the most money.

259
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,960
That one to one personal coaching.

260
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,200
And employees,

261
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,360
so, they're exiting employees.

262
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,040
I know this because I did research

263
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,320
with dozens of people.

264
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,960
I'm always on the phone a friend

265
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,680
for anyone who loses their job.

266
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,040
So, of course,

267
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,640
I treated it like a research project.

268
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,560
I had my list of questions.

269
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,760
And so, the way that the personal coaches

270
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,840
were described to me

271
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,680
was that they were formulaic

272
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,640
in their approach.

273
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,600
And that the person

274
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,960
didn't really get their industry;

275
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,520
they didn't get their work level;

276
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,880
and they didn't really get them

277
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,200
as a person.

278
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,560
So, that was one of the things they said

279
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,920
they were most excited about

280
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,200
about these programs,

281
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,320
but it's what disappointed them the most

282
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,960
because of their expectation was so great.

283
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,280
So, that's when I thought about

284
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,880
how could I put together a program

285
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,520
that had a lot of virtual components

286
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,920
that gave them a strong connection with it

287
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,600
and also took them along a journey.

288
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,720
And the other thing that

289
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,720
there was a big pain point,

290
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,160
you could do a little blooper reel

291
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,600
from this.

292
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,760
I guess you're putting it all in,

293
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
you don't edit, right?

294
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,920
That's the beauty of it.

295
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,840
Yeah.

296
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,000
The other pain point was that

297
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,800
when they get on online portals,

298
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,080
because a lot of these businesses

299
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,320
set up online portals,

300
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
it was like a resource dump.

301
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,760
So, there was all these resources.

302
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,560
And then, you know you're stressed

303
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,120
and anxious, so, the way

304
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,040
that I organized First 30

305
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,840
was very thoughtful.

306
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,320
So, it's so clear.

307
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,840
if you've got a job interview,

308
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,520
you know exactly where to go

309
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,480
in that program

310
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,840
to get the help that you need.

311
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,440
But we also do all of the same things

312
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,480
that these outplacement businesses do,

313
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,480
we do resume reviews;

314
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,600
we have a great resume expert,

315
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,280
she come here to follow.

316
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,920
And she actually does videos

317
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,560
and she'll review people's resume on video

318
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,160
and then it will be sent to them

319
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,800
so they can see exactly

320
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,560
what they need to do to change.

321
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,800
And they always have that video saved.

322
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,280
And so, I really tried to find

323
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,440
the best of the best.

324
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,880
It's really important to me to work

325
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,560
with the very very best people

326
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,800
and provide the absolute best service.

327
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
It just so happens,

328
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,080
because of the approach we've taken,

329
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,160
we can also do it

330
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,720
out of a fraction of the cost

331
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,960
of traditional outplacement companies.

332
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,640
So, just for the high level sake,

333
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,600
the idea behind First 30 is an alternative

334
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,200
to these very expensive

335
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,000
outplacement companies

336
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,240
that an organization that is going through

337
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,440
a restructuring or layoffs or onboarding,

338
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,200
they can come to First 30,

339
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,760
which is an online platform

340
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,360
that is personalized to the person

341
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,560
who's going through the layoff

342
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,440
or the onboarding

343
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,800
and gives them personal resources,

344
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,880
whether it be doing their own branding;

345
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,480
their resume revamp;

346
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,760
understanding what other opportunities

347
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,280
there are;

348
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,160
and understanding, I'm guessing,

349
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,240
that the whole way

350
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,480
of how this is going to happen, right?

351
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,120
Because I'm sure

352
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,320
there are a lot of questions for somebody

353
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,920
who is getting laid off.

354
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,680
Like what's going to happen

355
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,560
with my compensation,

356
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,200
what do I have to take care of now, right?

357
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,040
Yeah. So, there's not a lot

358
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,520
on the compensation part

359
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
because we are not lawyers.

360
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,600
And so, it's really important that

361
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,640
if they have those types of questions,

362
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,040
there's all kinds of lawyers

363
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,120
that they can contact.

364
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,920
And that is what

365
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,440
I would recommend to people

366
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,040
if they feel like they need to review that

367
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,560
with their employer.

368
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,480
But we do give them all kinds of,

369
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,520
so, it starts

370
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,640
at the beginning of the journey

371
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,120
like how they must be feeling.

372
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,400
Right away they need

373
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,080
our clinical psychologist, Dr. Marilyn,

374
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,240
who's in the program.

375
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,480
And she talks to them

376
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,360
about how to move forward.

377
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,480
It's all about moving forward

378
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,680
and taking control.

379
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,800
Taking care of your well-being,

380
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,880
but also growing as a professional.

381
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,400
Sorry.

382
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,880
The only thing I was going to add is

383
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,280
every two weeks or so,

384
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,120
we also run webinars.

385
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,280
I'm always there.

386
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,440
Sometimes I bring in an expert guest.

387
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,720
And I love the way that you do this,

388
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,560
because this is the way

389
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,720
we do our webinars.

390
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,280
We're talking with each other.

391
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,640
I'm trying to open it up now

392
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,040
so the audience members

393
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,480
can start contributing.

394
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,520
So, we do these all the time

395
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,880
and they're very organized

396
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,760
because there's a very clear purpose

397
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,320
and clear outtakes.

398
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,160
But they're also very open

399
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,080
and I've been there.

400
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,400
So, I'm not talking at anybody.

401
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,480
We're having a conversation together.

402
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,920
And that's the beauty of the program.

403
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,960
Right. And it's all about the individual

404
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,560
at the end, right?

405
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
So, one of the things also,

406
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,560
I think that it's part of the focus

407
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,320
in your book is this idea

408
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,560
of individual empowerment

409
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,600
and not just looking at it

410
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,040
from an organizational perspective,

411
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,880
but looking at how each individual

412
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,600
is going to go through

413
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,720
this difficult process of outplacement

414
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,440
or the happy but complicated process

415
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,920
of onboarding, right?

416
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,840
Yeah. The book itself,

417
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,920
the book is called,

418
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,880
A Spark in the Dark:

419
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,080
Illuminating your path

420
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,720
to a brilliant career in a reorg world.

421
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,680
So, the book has been published.

422
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,800
That's on Amazon.

423
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,760
It's also for people, for companies

424
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,280
who register their employees

425
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,920
in the program.

426
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,160
It's in the program too.

427
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,440
The audio edition

428
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,640
is actually being launched

429
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,310
to the public in September.

430
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,360
Oh, congrats.

431
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Thank you.

432
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,800
That book is all about

433
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,960
really what the world looks like, today,

434
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,640
what the career world looks like.

435
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,280
Of course, covid has had a huge impact.

436
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,960
And the book was written before that.

437
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,480
But it actually is a great book to read

438
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,160
when you're going and you're really trying

439
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,680
to make have a successful career

440
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,760
in this world, because that's precisely

441
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,880
what I'm talking about.

442
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,960
It answers the question,

443
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,680
"How do you have a successful career

444
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,600
when you're losing or changing your job

445
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,040
every two to three years?"

446
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,480
Because nobody's doing it for you.

447
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,160
I always hear this being said,

448
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,400
that no one cares more

449
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,000
about your career than you.

450
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,920
So, you better take the helm

451
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,000
and do something

452
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,720
because it's not just going to happen.

453
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,520
And I fear that, I always make the joke

454
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,120
that the next book that I'm going to write

455
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,480
is how to raise kids other people like

456
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,240
because likability

457
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,200
is so strongly connected

458
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,120
to your career outcome.

459
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,680
But I think so many people

460
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,040
are going into the corporate world

461
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,880
and with very loving parents

462
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,000
who have told them

463
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,080
that they're really good

464
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,560
at so many things.

465
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,320
And I fear that they're going out there

466
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,720
and finding out that it's,

467
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,960
we may be special to our loved ones,

468
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,280
but we're not going to be treated

469
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,280
like we're special in the world.

470
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,120
And because being special, it is special.

471
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,360
Like you're different than everybody else.

472
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,400
And of course, we all have

473
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,760
our unique abilities.

474
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,760
We're special to the people we love,

475
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,160
but we're not necessarily special,

476
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,040
if that makes sense.

477
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,000
I hate to say that. It's such a gloomy.

478
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,120
But when you get out in your career,

479
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,520
that's one of the first things

480
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,840
that people realize is that

481
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,480
you got to do the tough work.

482
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,880
I've done it, you know.

483
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,920
I'm sure you're doing it

484
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,840
like you're in school,

485
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,320
you're starting a career,

486
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,360
like you're doing the tough slog

487
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,280
to get there.

488
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,480
It doesn't all happen overnight, right?

489
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,760
Right. So, what are some

490
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,240
of the key insights that you've gained

491
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,400
over the past few years

492
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,520
understanding this ecosystem?

493
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,280
So, as you know,

494
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,360
as a young entrepreneur myself,

495
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:42,960
going on my journey

496
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,760
and a lot of my friends

497
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,760
who are running companies,

498
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,680
what are some key things

499
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,640
that we need to keep in mind

500
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,920
from a leadership perspective

501
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,640
on the whole process of onboarding

502
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,760
and outplacing employees,

503
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,040
except, of course, from using First 30

504
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,040
as an aid for our people?

505
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,360
Yeah. Well, I do think

506
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,720
that you have to consider the benefits.

507
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,560
When you on board

508
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,040
your employees very well,

509
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,520
your retention will be a lot higher.

510
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,600
That's proven in research.

511
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,760
That employees stay longer,

512
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,560
they're more productive right away,

513
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,360
and it will help

514
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,400
your overall employer brand

515
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,560
both to on board really well

516
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,440
with excellence,

517
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,760
and to treat the employees

518
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,080
that are leaving really well.

519
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,840
It's a very very small world.

520
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm sure you're finding that,

521
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,880
especially doing all these shows.

522
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,720
I mean, your world

523
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,880
just keeps getting smaller and smaller.

524
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,360
I think it's great.

525
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,480
But I would say,

526
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,920
make sure that you treat people well

527
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,120
because it will have

528
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,560
a real financial impact on your business

529
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,120
when you do.

530
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,880
So, when I work with suppliers,

531
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,720
even I make sure

532
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,040
that I pay my suppliers

533
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
what they're worth.

534
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,680
I don't try to get them down to pricing

535
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,200
because why wouldn't I just pay

536
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,720
if it's a quality service

537
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,080
and they're an entrepreneur just like me.

538
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,640
I work with a lot of other entrepreneurs.

539
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,240
We have built the First 30.

540
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,600
Anyone who goes to the First 30 website,

541
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,960
it's first30ready.com,

542
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,680
will see the beautiful branding

543
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,400
on the website.

544
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,040
And that isn't me.

545
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,880
That's my designer, James White.

546
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,320
And he and I have an amazing relationship.

547
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,080
And the developers did a fantastic job.

548
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,960
And I do think

549
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,440
that it's how you treat people

550
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,800
just in general,

551
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,360
whether they're your employees

552
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,840
or your suppliers,

553
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,960
and to pay them what they're worth.

554
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,640
Yeah. So, I don't know if that helps.

555
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,680
And it's not specifically

556
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,600
about onboarding and outplacement,

557
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,440
but any entrepreneurs

558
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,920
going out on their own.

559
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,400
Do not cut corners

560
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,160
when it comes to how you pay people

561
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,240
and how you treat them

562
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,200
because the work will just be better.

563
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,880
Right?

564
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,600
Right.

565
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,440
So, obviously you're a researcher at heart

566
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,720
and it exudes from the conversation,

567
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,840
and from your journey.

568
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,800
What do you see

569
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,200
as the future of onboarding

570
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,480
and outplacement, let's say,

571
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,520
in 10, 20 years?

572
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,720
Do you think that the workforce

573
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,000
is going to continue at the trajectory of

574
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,960
every two to three years

575
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,680
you change jobs,

576
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,320
especially in the tech ecosystem?

577
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,160
Or do you expect some radical shifts

578
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,960
due to covid?

579
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,280
Well, certainly there's going to be

580
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,160
radical shifts due to covid.

581
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,040
There's new job,

582
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,360
new types of jobs opening up all the time.

583
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,960
I do believe that we're all

584
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,760
going to be seeing

585
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,720
that we're going to be having

586
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,120
multiple different jobs,

587
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,600
multiple different careers

588
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,280
over our career path.

589
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,400
That is not going to change

590
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,800
because the world is changing so quickly.

591
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,280
And what we need

592
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,360
in terms of specialties

593
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,600
and what people are capable of doing,

594
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,040
that will change

595
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,360
and it should change.

596
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,440
And I think people help themselves,

597
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,360
career professionals help themselves

598
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,120
by being aware that we live

599
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,080
in this reorg world.

600
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,560
So, you can get ahead of it

601
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,520
and keep scaling up

602
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,600
if you need to scale up

603
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,000
and looking around and see.

604
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,480
Never ever ever get complacent.

605
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,680
So, yes, I think

606
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,040
we're going to keep seeing the world

607
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,240
continue to change.

608
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,640
Restructuring happening

609
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,440
where I do like to think that

610
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
that opens up opportunities.

611
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,520
I don't like when I see people

612
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,480
lose their job,

613
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,880
but I certainly know what to do

614
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,320
to help them when they do.

615
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,760
So, I'm very happy

616
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,960
to have lunch First 30.

617
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,920
I think that type of business

618
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,680
will have a lot of potential

619
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,560
in the future for sure.

620
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,400
I love it.

621
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,840
Amy, 20 minutes go by way too fast

622
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,040
Oh, is it really at the end?

623
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,480
Unbelievable, right?

624
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,200
And I want to thank you

625
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,480
for being so generous with your time.

626
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,760
I know how busy you are.

627
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,680
And before we leave,

628
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,640
I have to ask the most important question,

629
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,880
three words that you would use

630
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,240
to describe yourself.

631
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,320
Well, I'll use two words and a phrase,

632
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,840
because in the book I talk about

633
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,320
an illuminate exercise

634
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,400
where you figure out who you are

635
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,720
and what you want to convey

636
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,440
to the world.

637
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,360
And at every single touch point

638
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,440
be that person.

639
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,880
So, mine are, I'm strong.

640
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
I'm sincere.

641
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,800
And if you know me,

642
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,280
I make your life better.

643
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,760
And those are the three things that I am

644
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,680
and I try to convey every day

645
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,880
at every touch point.

646
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,440
Amy thank you very very much.

647
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,960
This was very very insightful.

648
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
And I look forward

649
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,920
to definitely sharing this platform

650
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,000
and hopefully using it myself

651
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,560
to empower the people

652
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,680
that I'll get to work with

653
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,680
and have a meaningful experience

654
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,160
for everybody.

655
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,520
And it's definitely something

656
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,360
that's hugely relevant

657
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,000
over the past few months especially.

658
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,800
But moving forward

659
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,560
and the trajectory of the workforce

660
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,960
is going, it sounds like

661
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,040
the right place, right time.

662
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,360
So, thank you very much and good luck.

663
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,400
Thank you. I really enjoyed this.

664
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,360
And all the best.

665
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,240
Take care.

666
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
Bye.
