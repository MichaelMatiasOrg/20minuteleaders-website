1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,999
I think the biggest misconception

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,319
about people that are tattooed

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,479
or about getting tattooed is that,

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,879
it has this stigma

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,759
and people, think that people

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,910
just want to look bad ass.

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,839
Laura Schaack,

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,879
thank you so much for joining me

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,079
on 20 Minute Leaders.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,159
Good morning to you.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,639
Good noon.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,319
Yeah. Good afternoon over here.

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,160
Good afternoon to you.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,320
Good night to me.

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,640
That's what I love about,

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,999
corona times have been

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,480
very timing for a lot.

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,440
But this getting to adapt

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,320
to all these different times,

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,960
it's been pretty, pretty fun,

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,680
especially in a show like this.

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,760
Thank you for joining me.

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,880
I'm incredibly excited

24
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,840
to talk about tattoos,

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,080
of anything tattoos.

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,800
Laura, are you a tattoo artist

27
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,639
besides being a tattoo entrepreneur?

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,320
So, I'm actually not a tattoo artist.

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,560
And I think that's what has been

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,160
the detriment of a lot of people

31
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,440
that have attempted something

32
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,160
in the tattoo and tech space.

33
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,200
The majority of founders have

34
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,920
been tattoo artists who decide

35
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,640
maybe I want to build an app.

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,400
I'm coming from a different angle, right?

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,080
I've been working in tech

38
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,280
for the last 10 years.

39
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:29,559
So, like tech is my trade,

40
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,120
tech is what I know,

41
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,600
building apps is what I know.

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,480
And I love tattooing.

43
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,680
And I'm super heavily tattooed.

44
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,880
And I've got a lot of tattoo artist friends

45
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,800
here in New York.

46
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,640
So, I'm definitely coming at it

47
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
with a tech lens.

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,800
And the learning curve

49
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,600
is really the artistry side.

50
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,720
But it's a really interesting topic

51
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,240
to have as a learning curve.

52
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,160
So, what does that mean

53
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,360
when you say heavily tattooed?

54
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,680
Give me the details of it.

55
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:53,479
I'm heavily tattooed.

56
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,320
I've got a full sleeve on my arm.

57
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,200
I have, a couple,

58
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,880
sort of random ones here and there,

59
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,680
about half my left leg done.

60
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,240
I love that.

61
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:08,039
So, before we get into the tattoo space,

62
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,039
who are you Laura?

63
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,319
Give me the rundown of how you got

64
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,680
to be a tattoo entrepreneur in tech

65
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,360
and we'll dive into that intersection

66
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,840
a little bit later.

67
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,400
But I want to learn

68
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
a little bit more about you right now.

69
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,240
Yes. So, I kind of hop on

70
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
upon the tech scene, right?

71
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,120
And it happened, I think before

72
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,800
it got really, really popular.

73
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,480
And then Silicon Valley came out.

74
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,800
And now every gen Z

75
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,640
or just wants to be a founder

76
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,600
and be their own boss.

77
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:32,240
And that's really cool.

78
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:33,479
But there's a lot more to it

79
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,399
than that, right?

80
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Those are really hard.

81
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,640
But there's a lot of pressure

82
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,760
a lot of stress,

83
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,240
a lot of constant work.

84
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,840
So, it really wasn't romanticized for me,

85
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,907
honestly.

86
00:02:43,107 --> 00:02:45,160
I was working in a

87
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,280
international nonprofit space, actually.

88
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,240
And I needed something more fast paced.

89
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,160
I came here to New York when I was 17,

90
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,800
went to NYU, got out,

91
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,200
started working in the nonprofit space

92
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,760
and was like, this is great

93
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,960
and I love that I'm making an impact,

94
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,720
but it's not enough of an impact for me.

95
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,920
So, I need a type of industry

96
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,240
that is super fast paced,

97
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,720
that is going a mile a minute,

98
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,920
that is ready to try really innovative,

99
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,200
really risky things to see if that's

100
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,400
the optimal way of doing things

101
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,760
that probably only describes

102
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,720
the startup industry,

103
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,400
to be honest to you.

104
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,320
So, I sort of accidentally

105
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,240
moved into the startup space.

106
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,200
I was one of the first employees

107
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,960
at an incubator

108
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,240
that moved European SaaS companies

109
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,520
and integrated them into the US market.

110
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,000
I lived abroad.

111
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,440
I worked in Madrid, Spain, for a while.

112
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,840
So, I think these European entrepreneurs

113
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:35,639
were sort of like,

114
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,120
great, she has European experience.

115
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,480
And also, she's the only

116
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:39,319
American on the team.

117
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,480
We need a little both on the team.

118
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,760
So, this really took a chance.

119
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,520
I sat there and I took this job

120
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:46,839
at 23 or 4.

121
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,040
But I thought I just gonna travel Europe.

122
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,680
That was what I thought I was doing.

123
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,640
I didn't know at the time

124
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
that I was kind of entering

125
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,880
the early stage tech startup space.

126
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,960
Little did I know,

127
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:57,959
fast forward not even six months,

128
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,800
and I'm going to pitch competitions

129
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,840
and I'm talking about

130
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
go-to-market strategy,

131
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,840
and I'm talking about product market fit,

132
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,560
liaisoning with CEOs and CTOs from Europe

133
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,120
way earlier than I probably should have

134
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,680
in my professional career.

135
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,600
And sort of went on to really be

136
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,320
really well integrated

137
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,680
into the startup scene here in New York.

138
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:17,880
Right?

139
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,880
So, I also joined some startups

140
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,920
to build them from the very ground up.

141
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,120
I went through a number

142
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,920
of accelerator programs here in New York.

143
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,520
I'm in here for one now, actually.

144
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,000
And I think in a little bit after that,

145
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,640
I also worked at

146
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,880
some app development firms

147
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,360
It's little different

148
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,120
but they're understanding

149
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,480
of the tech side of things.

150
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,480
So, the idea for Tattd came about

151
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,360
much further along than

152
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,840
than whenever I started it, right?

153
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,520
I've had this idea for almost five years.

154
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,160
I only started it about

155
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,400
a year ago because

156
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:46,839
I came to the point where I was like,

157
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,160
first of all, it took me a long time

158
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,120
to become brave enough to do it, right?

159
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,680
Like, I had seen founders.

160
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,280
I'd seen the really ugly side,

161
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,440
like the really scary side,

162
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
the really tense side.

163
00:04:57,441 --> 00:04:59,239
I work for the startups that aren't like,

164
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,520
the Twitters of the world

165
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,600
where you just get free snacks all the time.

166
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,920
But, you know, there's some people

167
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,840
I'll meet on every the events,

168
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,720
some people are like, "Oh, yeah,

169
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
I work in the startup industry, too."

170
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,880
And I'm like, "But which type?"

171
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,320
I work to the type where you're unpaid,

172
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,160
working on the founder's apartment building.

173
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,680
Like we've had different experiences.

174
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,920
Do you know what I mean?

175
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,000
But I finally came

176
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,040
to a point in my career, I was like,

177
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,720
okay, I've had sort of this

178
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,680
trifecta of experience, right?

179
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,840
I have worked in incubators

180
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,960
where I'm seeing companies at scale.

181
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,800
So, the SaaS companies were moving over

182
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,960
are like series A, Series B level,

183
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,480
7, 8 years old, really ready to scale,

184
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,120
they have a lot of capital behind them.

185
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,280
I've seen things launch with very little

186
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,560
to no money from the very ground up,

187
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,760
and I finally have, after working

188
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,480
on some app development firms,

189
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,440
a thorough understanding

190
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,840
of the technology side of things.

191
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,920
So, I feel like I had sort of this

192
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,840
trifecta of experience

193
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,040
that would allow me to start Tattd

194
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,600
and make it really, really successful.

195
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,440
Even though I had this idea

196
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,160
for a long time.

197
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,640
So, hopefully, that's what I'm doing.

198
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,480
That's amazing.

199
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,920
So, let's go back just a little bit

200
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,000
the intersection of you.

201
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,200
You have this idea for Tattd

202
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,480
for about five years.

203
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,800
And we're talking about the tattoo market

204
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,560
and we're talking about a marketplace

205
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,480
that matches tattoo artists

206
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,200
with people that are looking

207
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,240
for their artists.

208
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,120
And so, talk to me a little bit

209
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,760
about the market,

210
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,720
because I really know nothing

211
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,760
about the tattoo industry.

212
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,800
I've been thinking,

213
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,240
and if my mom and my dad

214
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,600
and my girlfriend listen to this,

215
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
then I'm in trouble,

216
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,080
but I've been interested to understand

217
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,960
what is the tattoo market?

218
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,200
Why are people getting tattoos?

219
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,920
What is the benefit

220
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,160
or what does it do to them

221
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,440
emotionally or psychologically?

222
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,080
So, please teach me a little bit

223
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,280
about what's happening there.

224
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,720
Absolutely.

225
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,160
So, I think the biggest misconception

226
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:43,479
about people that are tattooed

227
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,000
or about getting tattooed

228
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,040
is that, it has this stigma.

229
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,920
And people think that people

230
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,160
just want to look badass.

231
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,080
And everyone has that story

232
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,800
of like their drunk sorority sister

233
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,240
that got some horrible tattoo

234
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,680
or whatever the case may be.

235
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,120
And we all smoke on the cigarettes

236
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,040
and maybe ride motorcycles

237
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,800
and like probably will curse at you

238
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:04,919
in a coffee shop line,

239
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,599
you know what I mean?

240
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,920
Like, this is the idea

241
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,160
of people that are tattooed.

242
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
And it is so inaccurate.

243
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,760
And I need like mainstream media

244
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,560
to stop making that portrayal.

245
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,840
I think people need to open their eyes

246
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,400
to the actual community of people

247
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,800
that are tattooed.

248
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,840
Tattooing is an art.

249
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,640
So funnily enough,

250
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,560
half my coursework

251
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:25,599
at NYU was art history.

252
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,960
Whenever I was like, a child,

253
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,400
I volunteered very young

254
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,600
as early as I could get a job

255
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,160
at the art museum.

256
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,880
I grew up in Austin, Texas, in Austin.

257
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,160
Like I thoroughly have

258
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:37,399
an understanding of fine art.

259
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,759
And tattooing is an art, right?

260
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,879
These people are usually

261
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,760
like illustrators or painters

262
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:44,799
and sort of come and start tattooing.

263
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,559
So, tattooing is really significant

264
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,239
to the tattoo artists,

265
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,079
but also a lot of the times

266
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,039
to the person getting a tattoo. Right?

267
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,119
People get a tattoo of sort of like

268
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,239
in memoriam of people that have passed.

269
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,519
People get tattooing because

270
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,200
it makes them feel empowered

271
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,440
about their body.

272
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,640
You know what I mean?

273
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:02,079
it's really closely aligned

274
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,800
with their identity and it's something

275
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,240
that is really special to people and

276
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,600
is a way to express themselves. Right?

277
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,120
It's not something that people go and say,

278
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,640
"Now, I feel really cool

279
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,320
and people can't talk to me anymore."

280
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,760
That's not it at all.

281
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,000
It's actually extremely special.

282
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,160
And I think millennials are really

283
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,240
kind of getting a hold of that.

284
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,880
Millennials and Gen Z,

285
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,000
people can say a lot about them,

286
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,920
but they really do push boundaries

287
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,760
and they really do

288
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,480
sort of defy the status quo.

289
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,080
And I think that's really benefited

290
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,240
the tattooing industry. Right?

291
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
They're no longer

292
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,200
pulling away from that stigma,

293
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,840
and people are getting into it.

294
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,800
There's also a trend within

295
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,240
that sort of mentality

296
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:44,319
that is sort of like

297
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,600
a personal brand customization.

298
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,080
You know what I mean?

299
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,560
And it's a question of

300
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,080
who am I and how do I differentiate.

301
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,320
What I remember growing up,

302
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,760
it was all about fitting in.

303
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,880
I think I was just sort of

304
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,840
on the cusp of that change.

305
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,720
So, it's really interesting

306
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,360
for someone my age,

307
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:03,319
I'm 29, if anyone wonder.

308
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,760
But I think it's interesting

309
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,280
for someone of my age that saw

310
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,320
what it was like that

311
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,760
the mental was to fit in

312
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,280
and become homogenous.

313
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,760
And now I have seen a huge shift,

314
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,400
and the mental is absolutely not that

315
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,840
if anything, it's the antithesis of that.

316
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,320
It's more like, who am I,

317
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,440
do I fit in with this people

318
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,400
or do I not.

319
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,880
And what is my individuality mean,

320
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,920
and how do I express

321
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,480
or define that individuality.

322
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:29,199
And so, I think that also sort of

323
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,040
spurring more and more.

324
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,200
I mean, the number of that show

325
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,240
the industry is increasing,

326
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
but I think, that's why.

327
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,680
So, give me a little bit about

328
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,240
the numbers of the industry.

329
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,600
Do we know how many

330
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,760
of the tattoo artists are out there?

331
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,360
What is the demand for it?

332
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,640
How many tattoos are being administered

333
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,880
on an annual basis, stuff like that?

334
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,360
Yeah.

335
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,480
We know that there's

336
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,000
145 million Americans

337
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,800
that are tattooed,

338
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:51,039
which is just about half.

339
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,919
Wait. Half of Americans are tattooed?

340
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,919
That's right.

341
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,280
What?

342
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,880
That sounds crazy.

343
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,719
A crazy number.

344
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,119
That's in 2019 data.

345
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
145 million.

346
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,640
Half of the US is tattooed.

347
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
And half of them

348
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,920
have more than one tattoo.

349
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,520
It's not just like one little one off.

350
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,560
You know what I mean?

351
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,840
A quarter of Americans

352
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,880
have more than one tattoo?

353
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,400
Yeah.

354
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:16,839
That's like the best engagement

355
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,240
of any product I've ever heard.

356
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,599
I mean, it's amazing.

357
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,999
And it's like, it's incredible to me that

358
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,639
not a lot of people

359
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,439
have really tried to harness the space.

360
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,760
This is a huge market,

361
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,160
It's a huge market and it's only growing.

362
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,960
it's gigantic.

363
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,520
Americans are spending

364
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,120
1.7 billion dollars a year on tattoos.

365
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,880
Billion with a B.

366
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,840
It's crazy.

367
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,240
And I think there's

368
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,920
a lot to say for the fact that

369
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,760
it's sort of this distraught industry.

370
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,400
There's not a center fine force to it.

371
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,760
There's not really leaders in the market

372
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,560
because all of these

373
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,400
are sort of individuals.

374
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:50,799
They're all individual freelancers.

375
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,520
They are small businesses,

376
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,040
the small shop in the corner

377
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,840
of that neighborhood that you go to

378
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,200
because you befriended.

379
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,160
That's so interesting.

380
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,400
Yeah.

381
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,640
How do you explain then

382
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,280
that there is such a big stigma

383
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,920
around tattoos,

384
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,280
yet, half of Americans have tattoos?

385
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,320
Yeah. It's interesting.

386
00:11:09,321 --> 00:11:11,399
I think people maybe get tattoos

387
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,919
and then maybe distance themselves

388
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,360
from the tattoo community.

389
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,320
So, there's a difference between

390
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,640
some that had a tattoo

391
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,000
and someone that is

392
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
part of this cult, if you will,

393
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,240
for lack of a better word.

394
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,000
And you know, people are very insular

395
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,040
about allowing other people

396
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,240
into that sort of cult mentality. Right?

397
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,000
And I think that has a lot to do

398
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,080
with the fact that they

399
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,200
have been stigmatized

400
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,160
and have been semi,

401
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,400
not discriminated against in a way

402
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,320
that many other groups are

403
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,000
for many other reasons.

404
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,240
But the stigma has sort of allowed

405
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,440
heavily tattooed people,

406
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,840
people that are a lot more heavily

407
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,760
in the industry than you know,

408
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,440
just having a one of tattoo.

409
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,680
Unless you really sort of band together

410
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:54,359
and nearly reject other people entering

411
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,519
the tattoo industry.

412
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,360
Which is also something

413
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,480
that Tattd is fighting, right?

414
00:11:57,481 --> 00:12:00,759
So, I remember the first time

415
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,759
I went to go get a big piece.

416
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,479
I walk into the studio and I was like,

417
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,560
"Okay, I have a tattoo idea.

418
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,599
This is what I want.

419
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,520
Can someone talk to me?"

420
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,200
And I got the stink eye of a lifetime

421
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,920
from this woman.

422
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:17,399
And she was just like,

423
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,360
"Can you just look up our artist

424
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,640
and contact the artist directly?"

425
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,920
You don't do that.

426
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,840
Like as if she's like, "Get out."

427
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,400
Wow.

428
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,840
I didn't know it operated like that.

429
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,880
You can't just go to a shop

430
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,600
because the shops are literally just

431
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,840
shares essentially

432
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,520
that they rent out to people.

433
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,520
Like you contract with the tattoo artist.

434
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,120
Yes.

435
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,600
I had no idea.

436
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,880
I thought you walk in and you say,

437
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,680
"You look like a great artist.

438
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,080
Come here and I want you

439
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,600
to draw something on me."

440
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,120
No, not personally custom.

441
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,760
So, I mean, they have like again,

442
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,240
like pushing towards to stigma,

443
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,120
but on the street with all the bars

444
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,080
on any given city,

445
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,000
there's probably tattoo shop

446
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,160
that you can probably walk in

447
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,040
and choose something off

448
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,320
of a laminated page in a binder

449
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,240
and get that tattoo.

450
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:01,879
That is not at all how the majority.

451
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,440
I thought it was more like a haircut,

452
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,880
that you have a big bunch

453
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,680
of different styles

454
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,360
and you can come in and say,

455
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,960
"I want this style now."

456
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,240
I had no idea.

457
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,840
A haircut you would have forever.

458
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,120
Right.

459
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,080
So, now it makes so much more sense to me

460
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,120
why there needs to be

461
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,280
a dedicated marketplace.

462
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,480
Because if you're contracting the artist,

463
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:19,920
first of all,

464
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,480
it doesn't make too much sense to me

465
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
that you only have access

466
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,880
to the local artists

467
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,320
that are you're seeing

468
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,200
in your a geographical area,

469
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,920
because if you're getting

470
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:28,159
a tattoo for life,

471
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,640
maybe you're willing to travel

472
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,880
a little bit farther

473
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,760
for that special artists,

474
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,800
five hour drive,

475
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,320
that can do something very, very special.

476
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,640
So, now it makes perfect sense.

477
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,440
Please keep going.

478
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,360
Absolutely.

479
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:39,840
Absolutely.

480
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,480
And there's also an issue with sort of

481
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,720
the data being very distraught.

482
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:47,119
So, when you're choosing a tattoo artist,

483
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,800
having all of the different data points

484
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,200
available to you is actually essential.

485
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,400
You can't just have one.

486
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,320
So, when I say data points,

487
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,040
I mean the artist's location.

488
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,760
I would love to go

489
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,000
and get tattooed in Tel Aviv,

490
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
probably not today.

491
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,800
You know what I mean?

492
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,080
So, location of the artist is essential.

493
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Price also is essential.

494
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,320
Because prices can range from,

495
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,760
they usually go in hourly rates.

496
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,480
They can range from like

497
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,200
a $100 an hour,

498
00:14:09,201 --> 00:14:11,559
I've seen some four $800 an hour.

499
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,199
$800 an hour?

500
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,319
$800 an hour.

501
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,960
I have seen it.

502
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,400
These are like celebrity tattoo artist,

503
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,120
but still.

504
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,760
I think I'm switching profession.

505
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,320
You should.

506
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,560
I think my fallbacks

507
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,040
should totally be tattoo artistry,

508
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,760
you know what I mean if this isn't work out.

509
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,640
That's incredible.

510
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,040
How many hours does it usually take

511
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,560
to get a significant tattoo?

512
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:36,919
Yeah. It can be anywhere from,

513
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,319
three to twelve.

514
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,200
It really depends on the size

515
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,280
and the detail.

516
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,640
Really?

517
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,960
Oh yeah.

518
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,040
The average tattoo cost is about $2500.

519
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,160
The average tattoo cost is $2500?

520
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,560
Yes.

521
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,720
Or that's maybe the average amount

522
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,240
that a person has spent on their tattoos.

523
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,440
That is still incredible.

524
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,280
It's in the thousands.

525
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,560
Yeah.

526
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,040
My tattoo is worth thousands.

527
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,959
If I'm comparing it for a second

528
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,840
to the streaming industry,

529
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,400
that's probably pretty much

530
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,320
what a person would pay

531
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,200
for Spotify, Netflix, Hulu,

532
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,400
over their entire lifetime.

533
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,480
Right. Exactly.

534
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,560
So, we're pretty much on the same size.

535
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,080
Okay. So, that's fascinating.

536
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,840
Talk to me a little bit about Tattd.

537
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,600
And talk to me about the challenges,

538
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,400
about the traction,

539
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,960
what insights have you gained

540
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,720
as you've been building this marketplace?

541
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,599
Yeah. Absolutely.

542
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,079
So, what we built is essentially

543
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,200
an intelligent search where

544
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,720
we're combining the ability to search

545
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,640
by location, price range, specialization.

546
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,000
So, speaking about to sort

547
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,560
of my history with art,

548
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,280
a tattoo artist specializes in a way

549
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,520
that is very significant

550
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,480
whenever you're making that choice.

551
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,040
So, a tattoo artist

552
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,480
that does impressionist tattoos

553
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,880
like a [--] fine art

554
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,240
doesn't do like pop art,

555
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,600
Andy Warhol stuff.

556
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,960
That's not the same person.

557
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,079
In the same way,

558
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,960
if you want a tattoo artist

559
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,600
to do like script tattoo

560
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,720
or if you want a tattoo artist

561
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,160
to do Americana,

562
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,160
you're not going to go to someone

563
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,880
that does the opposite thing.

564
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,360
You know what I mean?

565
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:10,760
So, you need to know

566
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,319
their specialization actually.

567
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,360
So, a tattoo artist by specialization

568
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,640
and you can even search by keyword

569
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,759
if you want to see a certain image,

570
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,880
if you want to see a butterfly

571
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,560
in their portfolio, fine, you can search

572
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,080
by a certain image as well, right?

573
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,840
So, you have all of these options.

574
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,560
Typically, what the user would have to do

575
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,120
is go to Yelp if they want to know

576
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,720
the location of the studio.

577
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,840
They would have to go to Instagram

578
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,960
and go on a hash tag of specialization.

579
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,080
Find a great artist,

580
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,320
wait there in Berlin.

581
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,440
There's no cohesive data.

582
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,680
So, that's what Tattd

583
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,400
has brought together.

584
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,800
The app itself

585
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,880
has actually gone beautifully.

586
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,360
Which is probably

587
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,040
because I've made history

588
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,960
in actually building app.

589
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,800
So, it's like, that part has gone

590
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,680
really, really smoothly.

591
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,600
And we've got an amazing,

592
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,680
amazing responsiveness.

593
00:16:50,681 --> 00:16:52,319
The number one thing

594
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,360
that I hear back is

595
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,640
how is this not been built before.

596
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:55,880
Right.

597
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,920
After this conversation,

598
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,800
I'm shocked myself.

599
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,360
I have been shocked this whole time

600
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:01,880
that I've been waiting

601
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,800
for someone else to do it.

602
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,880
I don't even know if I want to do this.

603
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,760
Because this is a little work

604
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,720
you guys someone else needs to do this.

605
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,960
And no one did.

606
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,000
And so, here we are.

607
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,560
But I love it.

608
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,880
It's like a labor of love.

609
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,640
And watching it

610
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,440
sort of gain traction and come about.

611
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,600
I mean, in the first month

612
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,480
we had 2,000 downloads.

613
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,200
We're only opening 12 launch cities,

614
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,520
the 12 most tattooed cities in the US.

615
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,080
What are some of them?

616
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,039
New York, LA, Austin, Miami, Denver,

617
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,760
Portland, Houston, San Diego,

618
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,520
San Francisco, Chicago.

619
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,600
All of the main ones

620
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,040
that you might imagine.

621
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,040
And I believe that these are also

622
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,480
the 12 main tech hubs of the US.

623
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,400
Yeah. Funnily enough,

624
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:45,999
the urban centers seem to follow

625
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,319
both of those trends for sure.

626
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,879
But what I want to do is make sure that

627
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,399
there is a strong database

628
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,439
in each of these cities. Right?

629
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,840
So, imagine I just like launch,

630
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,760
anywhere in the US.

631
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,320
What if you're in a Richmond

632
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
and like only two artists

633
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,200
have sign up there?

634
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,520
That's going to be a horrible experience.

635
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,160
And here I am looking at my app and say,

636
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,760
"There's no artist here actually."

637
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,920
Like, bye.

638
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,840
So, I was like,

639
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,040
all right, we need to concentrate

640
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,880
and limit a number of cities,

641
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,200
build a really strong database.

642
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,360
I want hundreds of artists, like if not,

643
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,560
like a thousand plus in each city,

644
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,520
and then I can launch

645
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,400
and get even more.

646
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,520
I want everyone on this app.

647
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,400
The kind of other thing to mention is

648
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,040
that it's free for both sides,

649
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,640
which no other platform

650
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
has been for artists.

651
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,680
Which is so horrible for them,

652
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,800
because these artists,

653
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,920
you know, they're trying to make

654
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,160
a living off of their art.

655
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,920
And it's not easy.

656
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,320
They have to pay

657
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,440
for their own health insurance.

658
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,200
Even if they're in a studio,

659
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,520
they pay for all their own materials.

660
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
All the ink you see,

661
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,840
which is very expensive,

662
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,680
all the machines, very expensive,

663
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,800
all insurances for their actual art.

664
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,520
It's literally everything they have

665
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,160
to actually pay for.

666
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,960
And then a studio

667
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,320
takes a cut on top of that.

668
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:58,399
So, making an artist pay for a platform

669
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
in order to promote themselves

670
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,240
can make any sense to me.

671
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,960
So, it is actually free for both sides.

672
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,680
And we still figure

673
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,080
out a way to monetize.

674
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,520
But that was really the important to me

675
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,840
just because it is a huge mission

676
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,800
to empower creative industries

677
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,640
through tech and allow these people

678
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,280
to not be paycheck to paycheck

679
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,280
for their whole lives.

680
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,200
So, that was really important.

681
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,880
The other thing that is of note is that

682
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,040
as I was becoming more acquainted

683
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,000
to the community and this was

684
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,280
very much a grassroots movement. Right?

685
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
So, instead of going

686
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
from the very ground up

687
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,160
and like, you know,

688
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,920
going to top tattoo artist in the US

689
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,200
and getting them to endorse us

690
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,960
or whatever it is,

691
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,440
I was like, all right,

692
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,400
they already have a following.

693
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Like, they already have enough business.

694
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,840
I want this to be a grassroots movement.

695
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,680
I want it to be real.

696
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,920
I want to speak for the people.

697
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,880
And that means for us as users,

698
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,000
but also for the tattoo artist.

699
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,360
We did tons of,

700
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,320
sort of micro influencer outreach.

701
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,560
We did an ambassador program

702
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,520
where literally I would take

703
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,760
30 minute calls with every single artist

704
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,800
that partnered with us

705
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,080
that wanted to be on the platform

706
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,200
and told them about the mission

707
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,080
and heard about their pain points

708
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,600
and all that.

709
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,760
And we got all these people

710
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:01,759
sort of behind it.

711
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,639
Now, as I became more and more acquainted

712
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,440
with the community

713
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,480
and probably after, as we're building

714
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
our social media presence

715
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,920
and sort of defining our brand,

716
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,000
for me and my value is that

717
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,480
diversity and inclusion of all people,

718
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,960
of every gender, race

719
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,280
and shape and size

720
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,240
was always going to be a part of this.

721
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,480
I thought I was going to get

722
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,240
sort of a nod from the tattoo community.

723
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,680
Like, yes, that's what we believe to.

724
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,920
Thank you so much.

725
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:29,559
Moving on.

726
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,800
Because of the counterculture, right?

727
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,280
It's a counterculture.

728
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,400
In my head, that meant,

729
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,480
that it was not subject

730
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,320
to the white male paradigm, you know.

731
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,560
So, it was like, great, okay,

732
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,400
we probably don't have to worry about that.

733
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,000
Little did I know,

734
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,240
the more I connected with people,

735
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,240
they were merely informing me

736
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,400
of my own mission.

737
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,560
And I really connected with people,

738
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,360
they were saying,

739
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,000
"Thank you so much

740
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,360
for being such a strong voice

741
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,760
for the LGBTQ community and tattooing."

742
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,320
And I was like,

743
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,760
"Am I a strong voice you had?"

744
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
I thought we were just

745
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,960
being inclusive and being diverse.

746
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,400
And the more and more I realized

747
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,760
that it actually is a huge issue

748
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,000
in tattoo culture,

749
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,800
which is shocking to me personally.

750
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,400
But it is at the end of the day,

751
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,080
when you think about it,

752
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,400
there's no HR department

753
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,640
for tattoo artists.

754
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,600
You know what I mean?

755
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,960
There's tons of stories about women

756
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,560
being harassed by shop owners,

757
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,000
you know what I mean?

758
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,280
Or worse.

759
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,440
So, there's no one

760
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,840
that's able to police that,

761
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,400
or is able to set these standards.

762
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,920
So, Tattd became to be

763
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,320
a really proactive voice for that,

764
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,240
nearly accidentally,

765
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,280
to be really honest with you.

766
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,160
And the more and more I got the response

767
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,840
and I had people reach out to me saying,

768
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,040
"I will work for you for free."

769
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,000
I had creative directors,

770
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,680
I had interns.

771
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,360
I had developer reaching out to me

772
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,720
that is connected to the community

773
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,280
that says, I had literally,

774
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,040
some come to me and said,

775
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,200
"I am gay and I have

776
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:47,759
never been comfortable

777
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,240
walking into tattoo parlor.

778
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,040
Thank you so much.

779
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,320
I would love to get a tattoo,

780
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,120
but I just don't even feel comfortable.

781
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,440
I want to work for you."

782
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,360
That's just remarkable.

783
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,280
And it's incredible.

784
00:21:58,281 --> 00:22:01,959
Laura, thank you.

785
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,040
Thank you for this inspiration.

786
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,480
Thank you for sharing these stories.

787
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,880
And it's amazing how that

788
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,400
the side effect consequences come about.

789
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,120
And I'm sure that that fulfillment

790
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,840
of hearing these remarks by people

791
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,080
that haven't felt comfortable

792
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,320
showing their passion

793
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,640
or exhibiting their excitement

794
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,280
over this industry,

795
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:25,239
it's just, it's really, really great.

796
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,240
So, it's a really fantastic job on that.

797
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,160
Thank you for doing good for the world.

798
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,840
Before we leave,

799
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,400
I have to ask you

800
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,800
for the most important question,

801
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,720
which is three words

802
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,280
that you would use to describe yourself

803
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,160
The hardest question.

804
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,240
The hardest question.

805
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,760
I would say authentic.

806
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,800
You usually get sort of me

807
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,440
unfiltered at all times.

808
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,360
For better or worse, authentic.

809
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,040
Passionate, if you didn't already notice.

810
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,120
Very passionate at everything I do.

811
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,000
Yeah. Definitely. Definitely

812
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,119
An adventurous I would say.

813
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,999
I feel like I usually am really ready

814
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,359
to try something new

815
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,999
and go out on a limb and take a risk.

816
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,159
I love that.

817
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,079
Laura, thank you very, very much.

818
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,759
Best of luck with Tattd.

819
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,799
I know it's just the beginning

820
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,319
of a long journey,

821
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,919
but it sounds like it's off

822
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,720
to a great beginning.

823
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,520
So, best of luck and I look forward

824
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,040
to following the journey closely.

825
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,760
Take care.

826
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,520
Absolutely.

827
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,240
Thank you so much.
