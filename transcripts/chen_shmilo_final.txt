1 But you have to realize that first, it's not enough and you have to be very much conscious of not getting in love too much with your idea, especially, with your solution. Chen Shmilo, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? Good. How are you, Michael? Thank you so much for having me. Thank you very much for spending time here. I know how busy you are making a lot of impact. And that's what I want to talk about today, impact. The impact that you're making right now is in the context of 8200 impact. And I can't wait to hear all about that. But your journey is just as fascinating as the work that you're doing now. And I know that you want to focus a lot on the impact of this organization. But I have to ask you a little bit about yourself and a little bit about your upbringing. Start all the way back to when you were leading the course group in your elementary school. And then, zip forward all the way to your public work moving to the private sector. Go ahead, Chen. Yeah. That's sounds really a  nice, fun fact. Right? So, besides singing, and it was only until Elementary School you know, when my voice changed then my plans have changed, too. But I've always wanted to be socially involved and to lead social activism wherever I was. So, even studying in high school when I was the head of the student council, then through initiating a special project during my military service at 8200 units, and through my university experience when I went to law school in Haifa University and I was the head of the students board there, it was always about using my skills, knowledge, passion to make things happen and change whatever there is to change and fix. So, this is basically who I am. So, whenever I need to choose my next step in my career path, I'm always looking at the intersection of what I know to do and what I desire to do. And I hope to find, you know, the right meeting point, the right intersection between these two elements. And this has led me through pretty much diverse positions till now. And the reason is being the managing director of 8200 impact acceleration program. Right. But before we get to the 8200 impact program, I have to talk a little bit about this dissonance between the public and private sector. So, Chen, you're telling me that the way that you grew up, you are always looking for ways to make an impact, right? It's always been, how can I find a connection between what I want to do and what I can do to make that impact. You become a lawyer and you go into the public and NGO sector trying to affect change in your community. So, tell me a little bit about this motivation to affect change, and sort of your realization and transition from the public to the private sector. So, I think it started during my internship. And I did my legal internship in one of the biggest law firms here in Tel Aviv. And was a really high quality practice there, but I didn't really feel connected to the mission. And it was defending and providing legal services to really big corporations, big private market entities. And I couldn't feel how we're changing the world by providing them with legal services. And there was even a specific case where I understood the legal case, it was pretty much obvious what should be the money that should be paid to the other partner of the side that we represented. And yet we had to spend months and months in district court in the north, you know, hiring over a very pretty much small amount of money. And I said, "Okay, this is not my destiny." And so, I was fortunate enough after finishing my internship and getting my lawyer license, to be a legislative aide to the Knesset. And I was like, you know, big fortune to work with former MK Dalia Itzik in her last term after she concluded her position as the speaker of the Knesset and was the head of the Kadima faction. And even though it was quite a short period of time, I learned a lot. And working at the Knesset, amending or proposing bills to amend the law, using my knowledge as a tourist to pursue social changes, I really liked it. And so, there after the elections back in 2013, I started to work at the Israeli Medical Association as their public policy director. And this is where I had the chance to promote public health issues and represent the physicians at the Knesset committees. And this is, you know, except of the best experience that you gain working with leaders of the physician world and working with MKs with the government, you also have the opportunities to promote things that you believe in. And that was the right place for me back then. Right. But at some point, when I return from the Humphrey Fellowship, I was a food writer in the US, spent almost a year in Richmond, Virginia focusing on public health management. I came back, I started being the CEO of the non profit in the health care system. I managed to include very important medicine, preventive medicine in the basic health basket here in Israel, called PrEP. Pre-exposure prophylaxis that prevents HIV transmission. But I also realized at the time that there's something broken in the system. It takes so much time. You have to pull so many strings. And I think, you know, covid-19 pandemic now is actually highlighted what I started to realize and feel even before the pandemic started, and that there has to be some kind of a game changer in this world so we have a more balanced economy, more opportunities for diverse population. This is where I started to aim at working in the private sector and specifically just to pursue change. So, in just a few sentences, how do you summarize that realization, that of the impact that you're able to make in the private sector versus the public sector? Because I hear of a lot of people that go from the private sector to the public sector to effect change because they're saying the real power lies in the decision makers, in the government and the NGOs, et cetera, not in the private sector. Yet Chen, you're saying I want to make the biggest impact I can so, I'm actually transitioning from my work in the public to the private. Am I getting that right? Yes, you are. Well, the thing is that I think the role of the government, the role of the state actually varies from one situation to another. And sometimes, the only thing the government needs to do is not to intervene. Sometimes it can be the catalyst for helping other organizations to make the change. They can be a partner, sometimes. They can be the regulator. But I think and I truly believe that the pandemic is highlighted this notion, they are not as strong as I used to think they are. Public are the regulators. So, the balance and the role is shifting. And I don't think we can ignore them. Absolutely not. But I mean, look at everything. Nobody could have done it better than the private market in collaboration and cooperation with governments. That should be implemented in other fields to. That makes perfect sense. So, given that realization and given that understanding and your motivation, talk to me a little bit about what you're spending so much of your time now, making an impact through the 8200 impact project. What is the vision and what's actually happening today? Right. So, we're actually affiliated with the 8200 Alumni Association. And it's part of our goal to harness the human capital of the alumni of the unit for the sake of the economy and society, we've created several exertion programs. I run the 8200 impact acceleration program, which supports technological ventures or what we call now, impact tech startups. Impact tech startups are different by three criteria points of categories. The first one is the intentionality test, is whether they have initiated the whole venture startup company in order to make significant change and to support significant social or environmental problem. How do you measure that? How do you measure intentionality amongst, you know, early stage founders that are just now beginning their journey? That's a wonderful question. Usually by their statements. Usually, by the way they stick to their intention throughout the process, even though it is harder to be in impact tech entrepreneur. It is harder to find a business model, it is harder to find investments. In many cases, your beneficiaries are not your clients because your beneficiaries are coming from disadvantaged communities that cannot afford paying for your product. And then it becomes more complicated. If they stick to the intention, if they talk about what they do in terms of not just making profit, which is great, and they have to make profit of course, especially those who are aiming at being a startup company, but then talking about measuring the social impact and it has to be embedded within the product. Then if this test is they're doing okay with the first test of intentionality. Right. It is not a clear cut. I mean, still black and white. And sometimes people are doing the social worship just stating they care about impact, about society or environment. But at the bottom line, they're not. So, you test along the way. Right. Okay, so that's the first test. And walk me through some of the other criteria of how you are observing these entrepreneurs. The second one is whether they intend and they have the ability to measure it. So, we're looking at the measurable social or environmental impact. Usually at this stage, we use this the SDG, the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN. And it's not a perfect method. But so far, things are happening in this field. So, we're using the SDGs mostly. And the third one is, you know, the financial revenue. Whether they can be a good fit for mainstream VCs, of impact VCs, angel. Whether they can come up with a really good idea and then product, the people would want to invest in. Right. And combination of the three criteria, it's pretty much complicated. So, when you do accept people into this cohort or into this group and program, what actually happens? How do you actually help these impact entrepreneurs that you now call them progressing to their, you know, make it actually happen? Yeah. So, it's a five-month program. We usually select each year between 10 to 12 entrepreneurs or ventures. Some of them operated as a company. Some are not at that stage. We provide them with a weekly day of workshops and lectures. A very intensive mentorship program. They have lead mentors, professional mentors, office hours and virtual board meetings. You know, kind of tailor made specific services plan for each entrepreneur, depending on the stage they're at, depending on their current needs. And I have to make sure that I create for them the right space to do amazing things. Right. Including connect and material support. Sometimes even credits from big corporation that can help them do what they do in a much faster pace. And at the end, we have a really big event showcase event, or annual demo day in which they're being exposed or investors are being exposed to our portfolio companies. Right. So, tell me a little bit about the impact that 8200 impact is making and how do you measure that impact? Are you a shareholder or stakeholder in these companies? What is sort of the relationship that you have with the entrepreneurs that are coming? So, our model is a philanthropic one. We don't charge anything. We don't invest. I mean, we don't get any equity. We do have a board of partners who are actually our sponsors and they actually create the budgets that we work with. The way we measure our stuff, that's a really good question, you know. The program is now, we're nearing the end of the sixth batch. So far, in the survey that we conducted very much recently, we have the figures of the accumulated investment sum of money of our companies is a little bit more than $45 million. And our startups have created more than 100 jobs in Israel, but not only in Israel. Which is pretty much a common criteria to measure an acceleration program. We also asked them about whether they measure their social impact and then see, you know, accordingly, if we can also present any progress with specific SDGs. Right. It's not that easy for an early stage startup. But we do see some progressing relating to SDGs. We're also adopting other methods of management within the startup company of diversity and accessibility for people with disability and other criteria that are more common in impact tech ventures. I think that makes perfect sense. So Chen, I'd love to spend the last few minutes that we have talking a little more broadly about impact and some lessons that you can provide to young entrepreneurs, whether they're in Tel Aviv and can take part in or in Israel and can take part in this great program or outside around the world. What are some of the lessons that you've learned along the way of that make up a successful impact venture? Or at least a successful enough to be able to take roots and grow even passed the first milestone of the formation of it? Wonderful question. Well, first, being an impact tech entrepreneur is well, it starts with being an entrepreneur. And here I have no news. You have to learn the whole you know, the whole system. Maybe people can read your book that was recently published. It starts with the notion that you want to be an entrepreneur you are courage enough. Really. Sometimes, maybe people will say you're crazy enough to start this amazing but very very painful journey. So, you have to be very much passionate about it. The second one that you have to know that making a positive impact is not something that has to do only with being a purpose driven entrepreneur. It is a whole system where you also have to measure it. Right. The third thing I would say, well, in many cases, our entrepreneurs that we support, have a very strong connection between the product and their personal life. Interesting. Sometimes, a really interesting advantage. Sometimes it could be very challenging. So, for example, female entrepreneur, that at some point had a very negative experience whether in terms of domestic violence or feeling unsafe in public places and she comes up with a brilliant idea of creating you know, an app that enhances the feeling of being safe on the streets. That could be an advantage. I think that can really strengthen your passion along the way. But you have to realize that first, it's not enough and you have to be very much conscious of not getting in love too much with your ideas, especially with your solution. I think that's, yeah, I think that's a wonderful point that you're making. We actually had a really brilliant guest. I think she's episode 190 something, Anita Kumari. And she founded The Happiness Factor. And she founded it as a result of a very abusive relationship that she had coming from India into a marriage that was unsuccessful. A very abusive marriage. And she founded an organization to help women gain confidence and support for dealing with these things. And so, I definitely see the value and being very connected to the product on an emotional level, especially when you are talking about impact. The other thing that I want to reiterate is you're mentioning of both being intentional but being measurable. That you know, just because you're making a social impact and you're doing social good often with impact, it doesn't mean that you should allow yourself to not measure your process and measure whether you're able to continue making that impact. Just like any regular venture where you have to, you know, you can sometimes measure sales and measure your revenue or your burn rate, here and maybe you don't need to measure sales, but you do want to measure whether the impact you're making is growing because that is the equivalent of sales for regular venture. You actually want to measure both. And that what makes it more complicated. So, you want to measure your sales, you want to show fraction. You want to show that you're moving the needle in terms of the specific social challenge. Wow. That makes a lot of sense. Chen, I want to thank you for being so generous with your time. There's more that I wanted to talk about, but we don't have enough time for that. So, we'll have to do another episode in the future. But before we leave, I have to ask you for the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. It's the hardest question. Of course. I would say passionate. I can't work with passionate people, unless I'm passionate myself about what I do. I hope I'm genuine enough. And then other two words, maybe three phrases and not three words, social activist. I truly believe, even being now in this intersection of business and making an impact, I truly believe that we are doing social activism in an innovative way. I love it. Chen, thank you very, very much. This is wonderful. Continue making a positive impact and continue helping others make a positive impact. And I can't wait to share this with the world. Thank you very much. Toda raba. Wonderful. Thank you, Michael.
