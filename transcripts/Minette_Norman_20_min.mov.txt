1 I would sit down with the engineers, the developers of the software and say, explain this to me, so that I completely understood it and only then could I write about it. Because, I mean, if you've ever tried to explain something you don't understand, it doesn't work, right? But if you understand it, you can take what is complex and make it simple. Minette Norman, welcome to 20 Minute Leaders. Thank you for joining me. How are you? I'm good. Thanks for having me and for inviting me Of course. Thank you. Where are you calling from right now? I'm in the San Francisco Bay Area. I live in Marin County, just north of San Francisco. Wonderful. It's a beautiful, beautiful area. I really enjoyed going hiking there before covid and hopefully after covid as well. More than 30 years of experience in the tech and software industry, but it all starts with nothing else but a major in drama and French. How does that happen? Exactly. How does that happen? I'm not quite sure. But I'll tell you the brief story of how it all went down. So, I got out of university with a degree in drama and French and realized that being an actor, which I aspired to be, is a really hard work. And I hated going to auditions. And I realized that wasn't for me. So, I had to get a job. My first job out a school was being a French teacher. But soon after that, I got a job at the French Trade Commission in New York City where I was living, when they introduced computers for the first time. And it turned out, this is going way, way back, this dates me more than twice your age, I think Michael, but this was like the original PCs, the IBM PC is back in the 80s, and it turned out I was a quick study. And I learned how to use them. I figured out how to use them pretty well. But what I was really good at was explaining how to use them to the people who didn't understand and who were kind of scared and intimidated by them. And so, that led me, that was sort of the crucial step in my career that led me to the tech industry. I decided to leave New York back in the late 80s and moved to California, where I'd grown up, in the Bay Area. And I decided, based on advice from a friend, that I was going to try to become a technical writer, because what technical writers do is actually translate technical information into something digestible and understandable by a layperson. And so, this is like 1989 timeframe. And I was applying to the very few software companies that were around, and one of them happened to be Adobe. And so, back in 1989, I'm having this interview at Adobe and they're asking me questions like, "What do you know about print reproduction and photography?" And the answer to all of those questions was, "I know nothing". But they hired me to be a technical writer and my first assignment was to write the tutorial for Photoshop version 1.0. No. Really? Yes. Seriously. Yes. Yes. And if you give me a minute, I'll probably, I have a copy here, I'm sure. I'll pull it out of my drawer. Wow, that is so cool. Can you see that? Yeah. Wow. That was 1989. It actually came out in 1990. So, that was my first job in tech. You wrote a book basically. That was your first published book. Exactly. That is just incredible. And I wrote several after for Photoshop and Illustrator and Premier and all sorts of Adobe products. And then, what happened after that is because I was young and it was early days and there were so much going on in Silicon Valley, so I moved around from company to company. So, I went from Adobe to Symantec. Actually, that's not the order. I went from Adobe to EFI to a startup, Symantec and then finally Autodesk. So, I basically, in 10 years from '89 to '99, I was a technical writer at five different companies in the Valley, and then in '99, I landed at Autodesk. And I ended up staying at Autodesk for 20 years. And I went on this crazy journey, right. So, talk to me about this crazy journey because you end up as vice president at Autodesk, which is incredible itself. But it's always the journey that's even more impressive. So, talk to me about the different stepping blocks that you've gone through during your time at Autodesk. Well, as I said, I started as a writer back in '99. And what happened pretty soon after I started is that my manager decided that she wanted me to be a manager. She said she needed a manager, she needed someone to manage the writers, and she saw potential in me for leadership and management. And I hadn't aspired to that at all. Michael, I was just, I was happy doing writing. And yet I said, "Well, I'll give it a try." She kind of twisted my arm. And so, I started being a manager of other technical writers. And then it turned out, I love that, because I'm very much a people person and I love the figuring out how people tick and that everyone's different and that you can't manage 10 different people in the same way. And so, I got into management and then I did that for several years, leading the technical writers. And then I decided I was bored. And I'd been doing technical writing for 10 years. And I've managed writers for a few more years. And I'm like, I want to learn something totally new. This is kind of how I am when I, that's why I moved around so much for those first 10 years. I just wanted to learn new things. So, I started looking around for a new job, both inside of Autodesk and outside. And it turned out there was this really interesting job internally to lead a team of engineers who were managing our software for localization. So, for those of you who don't know, localization is actually getting everything translated and ready for international markets. And there's this very specific software that they were managing that was really complex and they needed a new manager for the team. So, I applied for that job and that was for me, a real stepping stone because, you know, going from managing writers where I could do the work to managing engineers, where I couldn't do the work that they did was a real big jump for me. And I had to interview with a zillion people to get that job. And I got it. So, that was my first job out of my comfort zone, really. That's incredible. And I have to understand a little bit better this process of being a technical writer. And for example, taking the Photoshop version 1.0 guide for the layperson, talk to me a little bit about that process, I don't think neither myself nor most of my friends know really what goes into writing these guides. So, how does that process actually look? Yeah, and you know, it's so interesting. I mean, even the terminology, I don't think we even use the term technical writer anymore. It's often content designer, content developer is much more common now. And is often seem as part of design and UX and all of that. But back in the day, we called it technical writing. But what it really is and, you know, you have all, you and everyone else, whoever listens to this has experienced bad technical writing. It's when you buy something and you get the instructions and you can't follow them or they're just plain wrong or they don't make sense. What good technical writing is, is that the writer sits down and truly learns the software like Inside and out or whatever it is, hardware, software. I spent, and my process was I would learn everything I could on my own, and I would read whatever specifications, I would play with the software. But then I would sit down with the engineers, the developers of the software and say, explain this to me so that I completely understood it, and only then could I write about it. Because, I mean, if you've ever tried to explain something you don't understand, it doesn't work, right? But if you understand it, you can take what is complex and make it simple. And I think people, this is one of the things I really learned, and as I got better as a writer is, how can you take something infinitely complicated and make it as simple as possible. And that was always my goal. Now, you mentioned to me before this that, you know, going back to your major, drama in French, it's kind of played an interesting role in your career as it was unfolding into the different perspectives. And the skill sets that you had, while they didn't seem to align with the positions and what you had to, would you had to use, they actually were pretty beneficial. Tell me a little bit about how that came about. Yeah, I thought about that over the years because it's not necessarily obvious. But, you know, one thing I think is whenever you study and learn a foreign language, and I lived in France and I'm really fluent in French, so I was able to immerse myself in another language and culture. I think that makes you just much more adaptable to different cultures and different perspectives. Because you've learned to think in another language. I think that really helps in just, I mean, I've worked in very international companies so working with people from different cultures whose first language is not English. And so to me, it's always about communicating clearly, trying to understand the other person. And I think that has really served me well. And then from drama, I mean, drama is one of these underestimated skills, I think, because certainly acting you learn to listen to the other person. You learn to improvise because unexpected things happen. You learn to communicate in both verbal and non-verbal ways. And you learn, I think the thing that certainly stage acting and I know, I never did film, but I know this is true, it's such a collaborative process. You know, the actor is only as good as the director and the lighting and the costumes and everything else. And what I loved about theater is the collaborative nature of it, and I really saw the parallels in developing software. Because software is not just the software developer, it's the designer, it's the product manager, it's the marketing people and the salespeople and those technical writers and the QA people. And all of that is what makes a great product. And that's the same in theater. So, I think all of the skills are transportable. I have to look back to my high school days, I was a huge musical theater geek. I still am a musical theater fan, but I used to take part in every musical and every play that we had in school. My dream as a child was to be an actor on stage for the rest of my life. It turned out that I fell in love with computers and software. And so, that's where I'm at now. But looking back, I see it in every single aspect of my life. I see it in my relationships, I see it in the way that I communicate with people, this collaborative nature of what you're saying and you've mentioned that you're only as good as you are as a group. And being on stage, I remember in the shows, you know, we were kids, we've made mistakes all the time. Somebody would forget their lines in the middle of the play or this prop would fall from the sky. And we would find ourselves in this situation where we realized that, you know, we can't look good if we distance ourselves from the problem. We have to go at it together. And if we try to distance ourselves, we're only doing harm both to ourselves and to everybody else. And so, I really, really appreciate this insight and I couldn't agree more with it. Yeah, so it's not obvious that drama and French are the perfect preparation to eventually become VP of engineering at a software company. But in my mind, it couldn't have been better, honestly. So, if anybody's listening to this from Stanford and they're studying CS, consider moving to the drama or foreign language departments and you'll get perhaps to the same spot. But Minette, along the way, you make this pretty radical transition from being vice president at an amazing company like Autodesk to starting to speak to others and to share some of the key insights that you've gained along your career. Some of it is about compassion, about empathy, about acceptance. So, what are some of those insights? Well, I think I have to backtrack a little bit to tell you how I got to that. So, we sort of stopped with my career that I got to manage some engineers. And then many years went by and I ended up taking on a series of other leadership positions in the company. But to get to that VP of engineering job, I had gotten to a senior director role, I led a big department in the company, but to get to that VP role, I had to basically, the guy who was hiring for that role said, "You know Minette, you've got a great track record here, I know you're a good leader, but you have two strikes against you." And he was very clear about those two strikes. He said, "One, you were never an engineer. So, you have to gain credibility with the engineering community because although you've been in tech and you are technical, you weren't the one developing software. So you've got to gain credibility." And two, he said, "You're a woman. And the engineering leadership here is a boys club. And so, you're going to have to break into the boys club." And so what happened is I did not get the job right away. I had to do a 90 day trial. And during those 90 day, yeah, I did an acting role. So, I was acting VP for three months. And yeah, and during those three months, I basically had to win the endorsements of all the engineering leaders in the company. And they happened, at that time, to be all men. Wow. So, you were acting VP for three months. You have to get the acceptance of that boys club. Okay. That's incredible. Go on. So, I did. I mean, it's a long story, but I eventually, I did get that role and I did that role for about five years. And during the time, and my goal, what I was basically assigned to do was to transform engineering at Autodesk, which is, you can imagine, a huge task. It was about 9,000 people when I was there, about 3,500 engineers. And I realized none of this is a technical problem. I mean we had a lot of issues, we had all these different platforms and we had to really consolidate tools. But it was a behavioral issue, it was a people issue and it was culture. It was all about culture and how we behaved. And I got, as in that role is like, yeah, I had a great staff, I had very technical people working under me, but what I needed to do was really talk about how are we going to behave differently, how are we going to collaborate, how are we going to work more effectively together. And so I got myself a big education really through reading and being online and just reading a zillion books about human behavior. And I also became a real advocate for women and for people of color, because even though I am a white woman, I was very much in the minority because engineering is so male. And so, I often felt other, I often felt like I didn't fit in, like I wasn't included. And I wanted to change that. And so, when I finally left Autodesk after 20 years, I left last year, I realized, you know, Autodesk is a great company, but they're struggling with this, all the companies are struggling with inclusion. Diversity, inclusion and equity. And so, I wanted to bring my perspective and my experience and help others do better around this. Because, honestly, everyone's struggling and everyone needs help with that. Minette, you're vice president in the engineering space. 3,500 engineers at Autodesk and you're coming, you're saying, talking about how this is a behavioral problem, its culture at the end. And of course, you know, in 2020, we've seen that not just in tech, but around the world of how big of a part culture plays into our life and into our ability to thrive just as a planet, and as a global community. And I'd love for you to share a little bit more into the insights of how do you build a healthy culture both in large, large corporation like Autodesk, but also in a small startup? And I'm looking specifically selfish insights for me as I'm about to start my own entrepreneurial journey and for all of my friends that are in their journey, what are some key insights that you've gained about behavior and about culture and diversity and inclusion? Yeah. Well, there's so much and it is kind of hard to know where to start. But what I will say is that the leaders really set the tone. And I think, especially, big companies and small, but when you're a startup, often, and I've seen this, so much startups are going really fast. We're going to build something really cool, we're going to get it out there, we're going to try to get investment, we're going to try to get customers, and then later even, you know, even with a startup, they'll say, Oh, look, we're all men. Now, we got to hire some women and how are we going to do that? And it's almost too late, even if you're just a handful of men, because, do the women want to come work there, do the people of color want to come work there. So, I think that whether you're large or small, starting up or a 30 year old company, you need to be intentional and the leaders need to set the tone of being inclusive, and what that means in terms of leadership, and this is a lot of the work that I do is that leaders are not omniscient and they need to admit what they don't know. They need to be vulnerable. They need to be open to listening. And honestly, that is so much of what I think the problem is right now is that people don't know how to listen to their diverse employees and to hear their true experiences. And I've experienced this myself. A senior executive will say, "Don't bring me problems, bring me solutions." But honestly, you need to hear the problems before you can even attempt the solutions. And you need to be uncomfortable with that listening. You need to be willing to be uncomfortable and to say, I don't have all the answers, but I'm willing to listen and I'm going to make sure that this is a safe place where everyone's voice can be heard. And to me, that is the number one thing is that we have to make it safe. And people do not feel safe today speaking up and telling their truth. Right. And I love your take on being intentional about as a leader and being vocal about it, and being willing to be uncomfortable with the problem. And not just sugarcoating it or shrugging it aside. I think it's wonderful. How do you then make the impact now? So, you've left Autodesk. Part of the motivation from what I'm hearing from you is understand that you've made an incredible impact at your company, Autodesk. Then, this is a global problem along with many companies, and you're now looking to make that impact there. So, how do you go about doing that? Yeah. Well, I started my own consulting business this summer during covid because what else do you do during covid, right? I took a break and then realized that's what I wanted to do. But I've also, for many years, even when I was at Autodesk, I was a keynote speaker internally and externally. So I've been doing recently a fair number of keynotes that there's a real appetite to hear about diversity and inclusion. And so, I had one last month, I have one this next Friday. So, I'm trying to get the word out. But I do have a new client and that's a start up, and they're realizing that they may have an issue with equity and with inclusion. And so, we're just starting the conversations. And so, I'm doing both just the one on one engagements with smaller, large companies, and that's just starting. And then, I'm also giving talks because I feel like people just need to hear. And one of the things is that I will be honest in those talks. I'm not going to sugarcoat things and say that it's all perfect and I'll share my own experiences as well. I love that. Minette, I want to thank you for being so generous with your time. Before we go, I have to ask the most important question. Three words that you would use to describe yourself. All right. I have to start with authentic, because you only get one Minette. I don't have different personas for different environments. It's I'm always going to be real. So, authentic. Empathetic. I can't even turn off my empathy. And that's both a blessing and a curse. So, if you start crying, it's likely that I'm going to be crying with you. But, you know, that's just who I am. And then the third is, I don't know if I would say energetic or enthusiastic, I'll go with enthusiastic. Because I've just got a lot of, I've got so much oomph and I have so much I want to share and I want to help people and I want to get at it. Wonderful. Minette, thank you so much. This is wonderful. Continue making a positive impact in helping companies regain the equity and diverse nature that they all deserve and we all deserve. And I look forward to seeking your advice when I'm starting my own venture to make sure that I properly I'm leading by example and being intentional about it. So, thank you. Thank you. I would love to continue that with you. Michael, thanks so much. Take care.
