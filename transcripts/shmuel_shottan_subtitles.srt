8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,840
Shmuel, thank you so much

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,320
for being with me

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,240
on 20 Minute Leaders.

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:23,840
Thanks, Michael.

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,440
My pleasure.

13
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,240
Appreciate your project.

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:27,960
Thank you. Okay.

15
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,520
So, we already started this interview.

16
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,600
I forgot to hit record,

17
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,840
but it's great because it's part

18
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,750
of this whole informality.

19
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,600
Shmuel, we know each other

20
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,150
from J-Ventures,

21
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,280
a wonderful fund that we're both at.

22
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,880
And what I mentioned before

23
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,560
is that I just get so inspired every time

24
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,440
by senior insights and your motivation

25
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,240
and your passion for helping early stage

26
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,080
startups in and out of the fund.

27
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,760
So just to thank you for

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,400
everything that you're teaching me

29
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,880
through that great program.

30
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,480
And I'm really excited to learn

31
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,440
over these 20 minutes

32
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,960
who you are a little bit better.

33
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,880
So, let's get right back

34
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:00,680
to where we were.

35
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,200
Shmuel, who are you?

36
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,720
Okay. So, if I have to define myself

37
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,880
and I think I said it

38
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,080
before you forgot to record.

39
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,800
I am a computer architect,

40
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,240
that's how I define myself.

41
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,520
You started with interview.

42
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,680
I just want to mention.

43
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,400
I would venture to say that while

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,560
at the beginning of my career,

45
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,440
I was thinking that I'm an introvert.

46
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,520
Well, all engineers need to be.

47
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,160
I'm not exactly an introvert.

48
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm not going to spend a lot of time.

49
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,840
But at a certain point of my career,

50
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,960
when I'll venture to say,

51
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,120
was pushed into it

52
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,280
into engineering management.

53
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,640
I was a chip designer.

54
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,680
I was doing some cash control errors.

55
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,920
I was told, "Hey, take a team. Lead it. etc."

56
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,640
And one of the things I learned

57
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,240
and if you ask what makes me tick,

58
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm a product guy.

59
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,040
Which means

60
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,080
somebody has to use the product.

61
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,720
And when it occurred to me

62
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,000
subconsciously maybe

63
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,240
that I can do it with a team.

64
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,160
It takes a village

65
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,960
Whatever tactic it is.

66
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,560
Better than an individual contributor.

67
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,600
I continued as an engineering leader.

68
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,400
Maybe unique engineering leader

69
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,240
and never left the technology.

70
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,200
But never forgot that

71
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,400
I have to trust people

72
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,960
who are smarter than me.

73
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,760
I'll take all a small task.

74
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,320
But I see the big picture.

75
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,080
You mentioned you said

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,040
you were pushed into it.

77
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,640
What does that mean?

78
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,720
What does it mean?

79
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,800
Paint me the picture.

80
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,480
Take me back in time.

81
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,360
Okay. So, long answer.

82
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,600
How many in-directional

83
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,120
I'll have to remember.

84
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,880
How many pushes and then

85
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,520
how many pops off the stock.

86
00:02:53,530 --> 00:03:00,920
But came to the states as a young engineer,

87
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,440
part of an Israeli startup.

88
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,080
One of the first companies in Israel

89
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,680
that was called the startup.

90
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,320
I'm talking early 80s.

91
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,680
Wow.

92
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,800
I am not going in who the investor was.

93
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,560
It was all black and white back then. Right?

94
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,000
It was, I was a chip designer,

95
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,960
but we actually use chisels to

96
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,120
divide carving on the rocks.

97
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,160
Yeah, I can do jokes as good as you.

98
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,400
But to the point of,

99
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,440
I'm sorry, I apologize.

100
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,000
You have the erase button.

101
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,880
So, I came here as a young engineer.

102
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,840
I mean, maybe another in-directional.

103
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,250
I climb out of it as alternate hole.

104
00:03:39,255 --> 00:03:42,120
Technion graduate.

105
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,040
I started to work at a large

106
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,840
government military research institute.

107
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,520
Okay.

108
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,240
In Israel, you could call it Rafael.

109
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,880
So. And the reason I joined

110
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,360
I was third year in the Technion.

111
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,600
They come and say, "You join."

112
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,280
Was kind of the plan.

113
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,520
Hey, plans, plans never happen.

114
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,360
Kind of the plan.

115
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,760
Okay, what I'm doing there,

116
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,680
which had nothing to do with computers,

117
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,080
but it was pattern recognition,

118
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,800
video analysis, etc.

119
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,200
We had video at that time.

120
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,160
But yeah, it will be my

121
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,520
thesis and then maybe PFT.

122
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,720
Anyway, I joined the startup

123
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,360
that was doing super many,

124
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,400
unique super many in the early 80s.

125
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,040
Never looked back.

126
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,440
Came to this country

127
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,640
kicking and screaming.

128
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,320
Really.

129
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,000
I mean I just got married

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,040
couple of months before

131
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,800
we bake the first son.

132
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,200
My wife had to take a leave of absence

133
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,280
and 38 years after it I'm still here.

134
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,440
But now going back,

135
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,320
I'd never forget

136
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,720
the pops and pushes are on the stock.

137
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,920
What does I mean push?

138
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,320
So, I came here.

139
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,640
I started to work as a designer

140
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,360
for an American company,

141
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,400
who required the Israeli startup,

142
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,200
with colleagues of mine.

143
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:13,160
And my domain was whatever,

144
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,440
doing the cash controller.

145
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,000
At a certain point,

146
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,280
and I had no pretension.

147
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,000
I didn't even know I'm staying.

148
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,240
At a certain point.

149
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,480
Push means,

150
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,880
my mentor at that time,

151
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,840
and I use the term mentor a lot

152
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,960
because if I'll ever write a book color,

153
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,920
I get about all the people I learned from

154
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,680
basically said,

155
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,800
"You should lead the team."

156
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,840
And then it was,

157
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,820
"We'll make you a manager."

158
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,560
And then I was, when I say

159
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,280
kicking and screaming again,

160
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,440
the pushed was,

161
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,120
"No, I just want to write test vectors

162
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,920
to what I design."

163
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,320
I hope I explained the push.

164
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,640
So, somebody saw something and,

165
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,640
And here you are after--

166
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,400
And he was right.

167
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,920
Right. Okay.

168
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,120
So, now fast forward.

169
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,000
You've been an SVP at quite

170
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,440
a few organizations.

171
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,800
Huge organizations.

172
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,320
So, talk to me a little bit about

173
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,400
what is the role

174
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,200
of a senior vice president of engineering?

175
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,800
What does that even mean?

176
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,880
What does it mean?

177
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,440
So, huge means after the acquisitions,

178
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,560
I mean, I have been part of three startups.

179
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,400
All the companies that are startup,

180
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,800
they ended in acquisition.

181
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Usually I didn't stay.

182
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,360
At the current one I stayed.

183
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,880
Not gonna ask why.

184
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,800
But what does it mean?

185
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,000
It means responsibility

186
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,160
for delivering the product.

187
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,800
I'm not the architect anymore,

188
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,480
although I try to remain as technical.

189
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,400
It means you asked,

190
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,480
you said that at the end

191
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,160
you lost me, but,

192
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,400
it means re-fix, it means people,

193
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,200
because--

194
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,240
you're already giving me

195
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,440
the answer for them.

196
00:06:59,440 --> 00:06:59,760
This is cheating.

197
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,840
No, no, no, no, no, no.

198
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,080
I'm not defining myself.

199
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,880
But it means people.

200
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,240
It means a project

201
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,720
which has a timeline,

202
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,360
nothing words explained, etc.

203
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,600
And it means a product.

204
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,960
Which means working with

205
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,280
product management, the customers, etc.

206
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,840
to define the MVP, etc.

207
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,120
It's all about the delivery.

208
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,960
Right.

209
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,720
But when I say people,

210
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,160
I never forget that

211
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,880
an engineering leader,

212
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,840
and I had a term S VP, VP, etc.

213
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,520
It's really an engineering leadership

214
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,280
is about people.

215
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,520
And remembering that

216
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,720
you delegate to people who are,

217
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,520
I hate the term

218
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,240
because we don't do a competition,

219
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,680
smarter than you.

220
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,160
And you delegate to people

221
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,680
who cover for your weaknesses.

222
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,480
Right. Okay.

223
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,120
But not passes all the strengths

224
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,760
and weaknesses.

225
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,480
But that's really

226
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,560
the definition of the job.

227
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,640
And between those

228
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,840
in those three startups,

229
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,600
depending where they invest

230
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,320
or where

231
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,840
and two of them almost die.

232
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,720
Then I had to help redefine the company.

233
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,680
By the way, when I say I,

234
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,880
it's just a habit.

235
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,280
But I remember that.

236
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:17,560
It's never I.

237
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,720
It's us.

238
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,760
But.

239
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,240
Shmuel, how many people

240
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,440
are you leading now?

241
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,600
About 300.

242
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,960
I've led a thousand before.

243
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,000
But you don't lead them directly.

244
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,480
But Shmuel, you're defining the culture.

245
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,640
You're defining what it means

246
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,960
to deliver the product.

247
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,040
How do you lead a thousand people?

248
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,160
A thousand people?

249
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,720
It doesn't matter if it's direct or

250
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,600
if there is different steps

251
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,480
of the pyramid.

252
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,960
And then they're looking at you

253
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,120
as the person who's defining

254
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,560
the strategy and trajectory.

255
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,240
Is as simple as one word, maybe two.

256
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,600
And again,

257
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,280
clarity.

258
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,240
You'll have to explain

259
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,640
what's the true north,

260
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,240
because in order to get to a product,

261
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,000
if it's an innovative product,

262
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,360
there are challenges.

263
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,320
You are going to remember

264
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,800
that you're not gonna,

265
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,320
So, you have to make sure

266
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,040
you are getting into the true north.

267
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,080
You have to help them realize.

268
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,800
Where do you move resources

269
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,840
and one task to another?

270
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,120
When I say true north

271
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,520
think how a chimpanzee or a gorilla

272
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,040
moves in the jungle.

273
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,320
If you watch him,

274
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,640
you'll see he jumped from limb to limb,

275
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,080
from tree to tree.

276
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,720
He knows where your key is going.

277
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,080
My job was to make sure

278
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,600
that we know where we are going.

279
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,160
Because at certain times at the project,

280
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,360
you don't know where you're going.

281
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,360
Clarity is key.

282
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,800
What really do we need to expect?

283
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,160
Run interference.

284
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,480
Because especially in large company,

285
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,560
accurate acquisitions,

286
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,160
there is a huge.

287
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,240
Contingency of people

288
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,560
who are trying to help you,

289
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,000
but they are not stakeholders.

290
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,240
All right.

291
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
Let's leave it at this.

292
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,800
At the startup, it's easy.

293
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,040
It's small.

294
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,680
All the management team came together.

295
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,240
It's much easier to do a project

296
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,720
with 10 engineers.

297
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,760
And that's how it started.

298
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,680
And then grow to a hundred.

299
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,680
Then work on a large company.

300
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,200
And last but not least,

301
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,760
I'm sorry if I'm preaching,

302
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,680
No no no.

303
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,840
Especially with engineers.

304
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,240
They simply don't send videos,

305
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,920
don't behave as an exec.

306
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,040
I was told I'm not the right exec.

307
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,160
Which is true.

308
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,080
But apparently, I do something right.

309
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,880
But I am not a typical,

310
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,640
I'm not a typical exec.

311
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,880
I don't communicate by long e-mails.

312
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,640
I don't send long e-mails.

313
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,240
You stand in front of them.

314
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,760
You try to do some small coffee gatherings.

315
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,040
Well, I can't now so I do it at Zoom.

316
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,720
I need to change my headset

317
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,480
because the headset is now glued to me.

318
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:15,000
But back to what I was saying.

319
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,400
They remember what you say.

320
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,760
So, say what do you mean,

321
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,680
mean what you say,

322
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,400
and deliver.

323
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,640
Because it's all about trust in my opinion.

324
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,840
Amazing. And I think that's inspiring to hear

325
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,560
at a time when even in small companies

326
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,200
and I have the benefit of also seeing

327
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,360
a lot of my friends go into all these

328
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,200
different startups.

329
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,840
And here in Palo Alto,

330
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,400
there's a lot of excitement over

331
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,240
everything that's happening.

332
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,520
And even somebody who's in a leadership role

333
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,760
in the tiniest startup.

334
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,480
I mean, people especially I think

335
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,400
my generation.

336
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,280
I guess I think a little bit

337
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,920
more than previous generations,

338
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,440
enjoyed the titles

339
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,520
and enjoy the responsibility.

340
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,920
And it comes across also

341
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,240
within the workforce, I think.

342
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,320
At least from what my friends

343
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,840
are telling me,

344
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,400
that why is that

345
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,720
my team leader of five

346
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,480
sending me these crazy pitches

347
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,080
and the slide deck

348
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,960
to represent a simple idea.

349
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,040
And why wouldn't they do

350
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,240
a one on one with me?

351
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,280
And which is exactly what

352
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,480
you are saying here.

353
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,200
And again, I am atypical.

354
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,120
I mean it.

355
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,600
I'm not saying I'm better

356
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,640
or worse or whatever.

357
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,520
That's my style.

358
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,880
It worked for me.

359
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,600
I can't tell you if it works for others.

360
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,800
A lot of my colleagues are

361
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,360
now corporate America.

362
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,520
I used corporate America.

363
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,640
I work a lot of Japan.

364
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,160
It's a corporate worldwide which is

365
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,440
that means that's it.

366
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,120
And then there is a video

367
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,080
and a Zoom to 100 people.

368
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,280
I don't.

369
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,840
But I don't and I admit it.

370
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:44,920
It's my weakness.

371
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,160
I'm not good at it.

372
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,360
I am much better at one on one.

373
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,920
The other thing to remember

374
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,520
and again, when I learned it,

375
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,720
and that was my failure at the beginning,

376
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,480
when I learned it things started to work.

377
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,600
Check the ego at the door.

378
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,520
Check the ego at the door.

379
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,320
There was a period,

380
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,160
I would say, in the late 80s, mid 90s.

381
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,440
That I was thinking

382
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,920
I'm the smartest guy walking the planet.

383
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,800
Because I can design supercomputers,

384
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,560
whatever.

385
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,040
And credit to friends.

386
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,200
Credit to my wife for the two kids.

387
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,080
Credit to who told me that,

388
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,600
Okay.

389
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,360
Well, about to make you a raise.

390
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,040
My shit does stink.

391
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:40,640
And that was quiet and education.

392
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,640
And I realized I have an ego.

393
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,200
Well, all successful people have egos.

394
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,200
If you don't learn

395
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,160
to check them at the door.

396
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,800
Some humility.

397
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,320
You're not gonna be successful.

398
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,400
I mean, others are.

399
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,560
But it didn't work for me.

400
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,280
Shmuel, and it goes hand-in-hand

401
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,920
with what you told me

402
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,240
right before we started.

403
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,920
Which was you look at millennials

404
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,160
who are coming in as engineers

405
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,320
and you realize

406
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,640
two pretty contradicting things

407
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,120
yet complimentary things. Right?

408
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,000
Okay. So, let me start at the high level.

409
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,080
So, they were born with computers.

410
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,480
I wasn't.

411
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,200
I never saw a computer until my

412
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,080
third year at the Technion.

413
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,760
Okay. It shows my age.

414
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,920
But I told you that I came

415
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,640
here in the early 80s.

416
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:35,160
I was getting my dad, Billy,

417
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:39,840
and I had some big simulation,

418
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,880
RF simulation in Fortrun.

419
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,320
And guess what?

420
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:47,600
The Technion had that time a 37168.

421
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,520
And I had to program it on punch cards

422
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,520
and go and submit the job.

423
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,320
And learn stuff like job control language.

424
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,200
And one of my colleagues Sonny said,

425
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,800
"Why don't you have an accountant TSO?"

426
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,480
And I go, "What's TSO?"

427
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,480
"Oh, it's a time-sharing option."

428
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,600
"Good. How do I get it?"

429
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,640
"Oh, you'll have to study

430
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,520
computer science."

431
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,560
So basically, I had computer science

432
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,160
and never looked back.

433
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,120
But now to the point.

434
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,760
So, I didn't grow up with computers,

435
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,200
but I was lucky,

436
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:25,240
Most of my professional fun,

437
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,480
I almost say career

438
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,400
and I hate that term,

439
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,600
but call it career,

440
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,600
was in the 80s and the 90s.

441
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,640
And as far as I'm concerned,

442
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,760
that's the decade

443
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,400
where computer architecture

444
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,800
was defined.

445
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:42,280
And it gave me a foundation

446
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,000
that I still use

447
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,680
because I was doing cash controllers

448
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,640
and I was a designer

449
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,680
on a risk processors

450
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,840
and their operating system

451
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,720
was at that time

452
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,560
Unix System V and etc, etc.

453
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,920
I became a much better software person,

454
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,920
system person,

455
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,000
because I understood

456
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,160
operating systems to adapt

457
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,520
that only a designer of processors

458
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,840
could understand.

459
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,840
Now I say,

460
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,440
Okay, that's the advantage.

461
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,280
And that's what I use now

462
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,200
to obstruct stuff at a higher level.

463
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,400
But when I say that your generation

464
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,560
is much better than me

465
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,920
and I envy you,

466
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,040
I struggle with the simplicity

467
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,840
where you guys take micro services

468
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,400
and combine it to Google analytics

469
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,160
and whatever

470
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:42,000
and blah, blah, blah, blah.

471
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,400
I don't say my kid can write in python.

472
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,720
I struggled with it.

473
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,960
I mean, but at a certain point

474
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,760
I realized that I can help

475
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,680
because I can understand stuff

476
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,760
that they don't.

477
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,440
Because it's so natural.

478
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,040
So, the foundation of

479
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,320
how the processor works

480
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,560
and how the operating system works,

481
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,560
and I don't care

482
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:10,720
is it virtualize or containerize,

483
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,120
or in the cloud

484
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,840
still gives me an advantage.

485
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,830
I hope I answer why I have both

486
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,750
an advantage and a disadvantage.

487
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,960
100%, 100%

488
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,040
I'm a dinosaur.

489
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,350
But I'm lucky that dinosaur,

490
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,240
Sorry, but I'm lucky that

491
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,320
my professional learning

492
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,680
was at the decade that processors

493
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,720
took a giant leap.

494
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,400
Definitely. I think one of the things

495
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,750
that I grew up with in my house,

496
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,560
which was also,

497
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,600
I come from a house where

498
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,040
I have quite a strong tech presence

499
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,350
and great mentorship.

500
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,280
And one of the things that

501
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,200
I was always taught

502
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,120
from very young

503
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,560
is first to get the foundation.

504
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,760
Get to really understand

505
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,070
the foundations.

506
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,960
Learn the advanced mathematics,

507
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,240
understand how things are happening,

508
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,440
and then you'll be able

509
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,520
to apply these things at an abstract

510
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,200
later on whatever technologies.

511
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,280
And what I do see and I agree with you

512
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,400
is that a lot of a lot of engineers today,

513
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,120
they jump straight into Python and JavaScript

514
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,840
and today it's all commoditize.

515
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,560
It's very easy to go and write website

516
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,750
or run an application.

517
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,960
It's much harder to do the complex

518
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,240
and really cool stuff

519
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,680
because that's where the foundation kicks in.

520
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,030
So, I completely agree.

521
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,800
Shmuel, what are you so excited about now

522
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,510
with working with early stage startups?

523
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,840
So, you've been with startups yourself

524
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,600
as an executive,

525
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,040
but now you're also helping invest

526
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,120
and advise startups.

527
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,590
So, talk to me a little bit about this

528
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,000
this interest of yours that is

529
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,120
over the past decade or so.

530
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,560
So, working with startups again,

531
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,310
mostly advisory role.

532
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,310
That means on demand.

533
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,080
Nobody wants your advice

534
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,520
unless they have a need.

535
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,440
So, it goes everywhere from,

536
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,440
Hey, can you look at this problem

537
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,590
and use your brain to tell me?

538
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,440
I mean, most of advice means,

539
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,000
put it for me,

540
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,160
[--],

541
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,200
doing the same thing

542
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,790
and expecting different results.

543
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,350
The definition of lunacy.

544
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,160
A lot of time it's about sharing.

545
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,200
I hate to advice.

546
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,790
I don't give advice.

547
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,550
It's basically wrong.

548
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,510
But trying to use example and say,

549
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,920
here is what I have learned.

550
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,920
That's what the business side,

551
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,320
is the what the way I help.

552
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,830
On the technology.

553
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,880
Only when I asked to do a deep dive.

554
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,720
We talked about the foundation.

555
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,040
And yeah, I agree with you

556
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,440
and thanks for sharing with me.

557
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,600
I mean I didn't even know

558
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,160
I wanna do that I believe.

559
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,270
I started to physics and math

560
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,960
and whatever,

561
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,920
but credit to the Technion

562
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,200
I think still now.

563
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,480
But definitely at that time,

564
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:59,760
the foundation is much stronger than,

565
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,040
Hey, here is a quarter and we'll teach you

566
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,760
how to write JavaScript.

567
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,240
And nothing against it,

568
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,920
again, I envy those guys.

569
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,560
But at the end the really cool stuff

570
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,920
is the foundation.

571
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:16,960
The cool stuff is the foundation.

572
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,840
And that's what I'm trying to help with.

573
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,760
And that's not one semester

574
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,400
of learning how to do JavaScript.

575
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,830
Of course. Shmuel,

576
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,760
we're almost out of time.

577
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,440
I don't know why I called it

578
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,360
20-minute leaders.

579
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,960
I could have called it 30-minute leaders.

580
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,840
And I would have one 10 minutes more

581
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,560
with every person.

582
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,750
Stay on time.

583
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,750
I do have to ask you my last question.

584
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,200
Three words that you would

585
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,680
use to describe yourself.

586
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,590
Okay.

587
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,750
It's the hardest one.

588
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,960
Let's speak from 10.

589
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,340
So,

590
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,550
Direct.

591
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,000
Although I am American now.

592
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,400
So, I took American in business.

593
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:59,520
But that DNA has never.

594
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,560
Innovative.

595
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,830
Which is trying to, um.

596
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,680
Passionate.

597
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,310
I was told sometimes, "Relax, okay."

598
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,310
The passion will never disappear.

599
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,550
Humble is my word for you Shmuel.

600
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,680
It's extraordinary.

601
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,600
All the things that you've done

602
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,840
and you're still doing

603
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,080
yet you're here talking

604
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,790
with so much humility about everything.

605
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,840
And it really resonates.

606
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,160
So, thank you for the inspiration

607
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,960
and thank you for teaching me so much

608
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,110
through working together at J-Ventures.

609
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,280
It's really fantastic.

610
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,200
And thank you.

611
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,680
That's it.

612
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,200
Thank you, Michael.

613
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,480
Thanks for what you're doing.

614
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,040
Take care.
