1
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,040
All right.

2
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,200
Noa Gastfreund, how are you doing?

3
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,240
I'm good.

4
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,560
How are you?

5
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,840
I am fantastic.

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,760
I'm so excited to share

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,960
these next 20 minutes with you

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,120
to talk about

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,880
the wonderful hybrid program

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,600
that you're working on.

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,920
As well as some of the other endeavors

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,720
that you've had.

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,880
Noa, to get started,

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,600
I have to talk about this fun fact.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,600
You grew up wanting to be a supermodel.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,880
Talk to me a little bit about that.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,480
Okay. So, yeah.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,160
When I was 14, I guess, it was my dream.

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,360
I didn't realize that it won't happen.

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,040
Never. Because I'm not that tall. Yeah.

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,760
And no one told me.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,280
No one told me that.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,680
But I went to an agency in Israel,

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,040
called Roberto,

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,640
which is the well known agency

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,120
here in Israel.

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,640
And he accepted me also.

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,320
I don't know.

29
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,240
I thought that, I think it's a joke.

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't know. But he accepted me.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,400
But Noa, it's so discerning

32
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,480
because you don't have to be tall

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
to be a supermodel.

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,520
You don't have to be

35
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,700
with specific weight and height.

36
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,680
That's what everybody's talking about.

37
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,560
The whole "me too" movement.

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,880
You don't have to look a certain way

39
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,000
to be a supermodel.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,800
So, why is it so far fetched?

41
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,680
Nowadays, you are right.

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,680
But 14, 15 years ago, I'm not sure.

43
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,240
And now you know my age.

44
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,880
Yeah, but I'm past.

45
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,600
Now I know I can't be a model.

46
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,560
Everything is right.

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,160
All settled down. So, we are good.

48
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,600
And now you're focused

49
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,720
on doing good for the world.

50
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,640
So, Noa, let's start with a little bit

51
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,760
about Hybrid.

52
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,480
This incredible organization in Israel.

53
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,920
The name it aims to give

54
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,800
a little bit of a taste

55
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,960
into what you're trying to do.

56
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,640
But what is hybrid?

57
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,880
So, hybrid, I'll start from the beginning.

58
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,680
It's a call initiated between

59
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,520
the 8200 Alumni Association,

60
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,200
which I'm part of,

61
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,320
and the government in Israel.

62
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,280
Actually, Eitan and Fadi

63
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:49,480
initiated five years ago and thought that,

64
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,080
why not 8200

65
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,560
with all the connection and skills

66
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,000
that graduated in 8200 unit

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,720
can help other people,

68
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,880
which in our situation

69
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,600
is Arabs and Israelis.

70
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,640
So, why not.

71
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,800
So, I think, today,

72
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,240
it's something that it's more common

73
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,560
and people understand what we are doing

74
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,720
and love what we are doing.

75
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,440
And I think that five years ago, people,

76
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,600
not all of them understood the reason

77
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,240
and the match between the 8200

78
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,120
and the Arab community in Israel.

79
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,160
And I think it's a great success.

80
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,680
Because we are truly helping

81
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,200
the Arab society

82
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,520
succeed and merge into

83
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,280
the high tech ecosystem.

84
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,200
And specifically,

85
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,920
into the startup ecosystem. Yeah.

86
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,280
So, Noa, before we get deep

87
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,200
into the workings of the program

88
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,400
and how tangibly that happens,

89
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,800
give me a little bit of context

90
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,360
into the ecosystem

91
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,560
and the relationship between the 8200 unit

92
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,640
in the Israel Defense Forces

93
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,160
through the Arab communities in Israel.

94
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,520
The integration with the tech ecosystem.

95
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,280
Eric Schmidt, the former chairman

96
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,960
of Google, and now of Alphabet,

97
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,840
he talks a lot about

98
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,960
how the startup nation,

99
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,960
part of the foundation,

100
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,440
is built upon these technological units.

101
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,440
And the army in general,

102
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,760
where you take 18 year olds

103
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,400
and you give them the skills necessary

104
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,680
to both mature very quickly,

105
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,920
but also professionally to execute

106
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,200
on very mission driven missions.

107
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,360
So, give me a little context

108
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,600
into what's happening in Israel

109
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,880
and why is Hybrid even relevant,

110
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,480
especially in a place like Israel?

111
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,560
Because in other places around the world,

112
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,480
it might not seem

113
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,600
very forthcoming and relevant.

114
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Yeah.

115
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,880
So, here in Israel,

116
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:00,680
the 8200 and other units, army units,

117
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,120
are helping their graduates to succeed.

118
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,840
And it's a well known units

119
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,000
that you just needed to record it

120
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,120
in your CV and you're good to go.

121
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,520
And unfortunately, the Arabic community

122
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,120
are not taking part in this play.

123
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,680
And I think this is where Hybrid

124
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,480
is coming to action.

125
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,800
And actually take all the value

126
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,720
and the skill and the networking

127
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,720
of the 8200

128
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,880
that helped them to succeed

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,440
to the Arab community.

130
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,760
And sharing the success.

131
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,720
This is what I would say about Hybrid.

132
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,320
Sharing the success within those

133
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,600
that are not, I won't say lucky enough,

134
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,240
but that they don't take part

135
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,480
in this play and yeah,

136
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,280
and it's affected them for sure.

137
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,120
Right. So, up until now,

138
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,360
there is very clear distinction between

139
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,360
not just the Israeli, the Jewish Israelis

140
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,200
and the Arab communities,

141
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,440
but also within

142
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,760
the Jewish-Israeli community.

143
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,800
You have those that go

144
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,720
to the elite technological units,

145
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,800
like you're mentioning,

146
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,760
they put it on the CV

147
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,000
and they're pretty much good to go.

148
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,880
It's like the MIT

149
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,840
or the Harvard of the United States.

150
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,240
And then, you have a program like Hybrid

151
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,600
which aims to connect other communities

152
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,360
with that community.

153
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,840
So, what is the actual program?

154
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,280
And how does that actually take place?

155
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,240
Yeah. So, our goal is actually

156
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,000
to build a diverse team.

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,880
I can't say like Jewish and Arab,

158
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,560
and I can't say that it's something

159
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,640
that we are very succeeded by now.

160
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,120
But what we actually do is

161
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,800
under the 8200alumni association,

162
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,680
there are some accelerators.

163
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,760
And we are acting the same

164
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,240
as the other accelerators.

165
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,560
But we are aiming to find

166
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,520
the most talented Arabs in Israel

167
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,760
and actually act as a gift

168
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,720
or help them to get integrated

169
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,400
into the startup scene.

170
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,320
And I don't think we do something special

171
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,160
except understanding and knowing

172
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,480
who are our audience.

173
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,600
Understands their needs

174
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,080
and what we need to do

175
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,840
in order to to help them get integrated

176
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,680
into the startup ecosystem here in Israel.

177
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,800
So, what does it take

178
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,360
to get integrated into the ecosystem

179
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,960
for somebody who's growing up

180
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,800
someplace that is not necessarily

181
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
in the heart of Tel Aviv,

182
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,520
in the heart of startup nation.

183
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,120
Yet they have all the potential

184
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,000
and all the capabilities

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,440
of being a part of the startup nation.

186
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,880
What is the take

187
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,840
that you're doing within Hybrid?

188
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,960
Yeah. So, I think the first thing

189
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,280
that we are trying to help with

190
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,200
is changing their mindset, okay.

191
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,560
Those people are mostly coming from

192
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,440
more conservative norms and way of life.

193
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,840
And if they don't want to be like doctors

194
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,800
or something very conservative,

195
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,040
they joined the high tech,

196
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,720
but they mostly will join to corporates

197
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
where everything is stable

198
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,040
and without taking risks.

199
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
So, I think first

200
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,440
is changing their mindset.

201
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,040
Help them think how taking risks

202
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,840
can change their life

203
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,120
and can take them step ahead.

204
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,760
And help them take part in the play

205
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,080
with the other startups play,

206
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,040
the Jewish led startup play.

207
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,520
And second, I think networking,

208
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,840
it's a kind of challenge.

209
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,640
Because they are not taking part

210
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,680
of the army, not in the elite units

211
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,680
and other, I don't know,

212
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,400
other places that I was lucky enough

213
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,880
to take or maybe you.

214
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,240
So, this is the second thing

215
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
that we are trying to help with.

216
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,800
And pretty much, the rest is,

217
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,520
launching your own startup is

218
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,000
it's hard for everyone.

219
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,800
Jewish, Arabs, Christian,

220
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,360
but I think we are trying to help them

221
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,840
get to the starting line.

222
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,640
And from there, it's like have them

223
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,240
as each and every entrepreneur on Earth.

224
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,920
Because it's still challenging

225
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,240
being an entrepreneur.

226
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,760
Of course. So, paint me the picture.

227
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,400
How does the life cycle of the program

228
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,680
work from the moment

229
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,960
that somebody may go

230
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,160
in the hybrid website?

231
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,560
What is the relationship between

232
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,800
the participant of the hybrid program,

233
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,320
whether it's mentorship or accelerator

234
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,280
or whatever, until the moment

235
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,360
where they are, perhaps,

236
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,400
launching their own startup

237
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,200
and continuing to gain the support?

238
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,320
Yeah. So, basically,

239
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,480
we are meeting startups

240
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,760
within the whole year.

241
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,560
We are not waiting for a specific cohort

242
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,040
or specific event or something like this.

243
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,360
We are here to help.

244
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,760
This is the first thing

245
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,800
that it's important to say.

246
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,440
So, yeah. When they reach us out

247
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,960
and on every platform via email,

248
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,640
I don't know, meet us in events

249
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,880
or through the website,

250
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,800
we are very welcoming

251
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,240
and trying to help all of them.

252
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,400
Not all of them will join

253
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,320
the actual accelerator of the course.

254
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,880
But we are helping all of them

255
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,520
because we know we have a mission.

256
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,280
It's our mission to help those people

257
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,000
with or without joining the accelerator.

258
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,240
But the accelerator,

259
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,840
the six months program

260
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,720
is our main thing, okay?

261
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,080
And we work as cohorts.

262
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,720
Each year we have a six month program.

263
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,080
The main pillars will be

264
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,960
the mentoring program,

265
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,080
and the content, workshops, sessions,

266
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,360
one on ones, office hours with investors.

267
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,160
And pretty much everything, all you need

268
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,400
in order to build your own startup

269
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,560
and being entrepreneur in Israel,

270
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,800
we are here for them.

271
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,280
We are very listening to everything,

272
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,440
trying to help to do as much as we can

273
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,760
in order to to help them grow,

274
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,680
to help them succeed.

275
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,080
And our goal is

276
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,200
within these six months,

277
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,200
to have them being able

278
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,120
to reach out to investors

279
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,600
and raise their first round,

280
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,840
their seed round probably.

281
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,160
So, this is our main goal

282
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
within the accelerator.

283
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,920
But we are doing much more than that.

284
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,240
Of course. It's going to be impossible

285
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,320
over a 20 minute session to explain,

286
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,840
to really grasp what's happening there.

287
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,600
But I'll try.

288
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,200
So, talk to me a little bit

289
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,840
about the highlights that you've had

290
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,560
within the program.

291
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,720
Whether they're personal stories

292
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,160
that you've come across,

293
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,600
or people that whose lives

294
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,440
have been transformed by the mentorship

295
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,720
they've gained through hybrids.

296
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,880
Or perhaps startups that have actually

297
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,920
gone through the program

298
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,400
and have shown that

299
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
over these six months,

300
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,680
they're able to form a startup

301
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,520
and actually raise capital.

302
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:59,080
Yeah. So, I can start with saying that

303
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,120
we are looking forward

304
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,400
the cutting edge technology startup.

305
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,160
The talented people that we can find,

306
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,840
and yadda, yadda, yadda.

307
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,880
But I think we are mainly focused on

308
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,040
find the right people that qualified

309
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,200
being entrepreneur in the nearly future.

310
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,240
Okay?

311
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,560
So, within the Hybrid,

312
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,440
there are lots of pivots, changing routes,

313
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,720
a lot of things happening

314
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,520
within these six months.

315
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,960
And I have a lot of story to tell,

316
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,680
but if I need to pick one,

317
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,800
I would pick Mira Awwad,

318
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:50,040
which is a woman lead startups

319
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,880
called Mirrori.

320
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,320
And the co-founder and the CEO is Mira.

321
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,360
She's a 2018 graduates.

322
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,480
It was the third cycle of the hybrid.

323
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,640
She joined as a solo entrepreneur.

324
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,280
She came from the business,

325
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,040
she has a business background

326
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,680
with no technology founder.

327
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,320
And she came with an idea,

328
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,720
throughout the six months,

329
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,160
she changed the idea.

330
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,080
I won't say fine, but yeah,

331
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,400
there were lots of changes

332
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,600
within the team.

333
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,640
And by the end of the program,

334
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,120
she launched her startup,

335
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,360
raised their first round.

336
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,160
Now she is preparing

337
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,280
through their next round.

338
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,320
And she is, I don't know,

339
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,280
I really appreciate their journey

340
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,080
as entrepreneurs.

341
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,720
What is their startup doing?

342
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,320
It's a AI based beauty assistant

343
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,960
that helps you put your makeup

344
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,480
and pick your style

345
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,120
based on your face shape.

346
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,400
It's addictive technology startup.

347
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,360
And very interesting

348
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,840
what they're doing there, really. Yeah.

349
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,640
Very very cool.

350
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,400
So, Mira Awwad comes in.

351
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,880
She comes in with some business acumen

352
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,400
but no technology founding teams.

353
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,720
She goes through the six month program.

354
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,160
By the way, how intensive is this program?

355
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,360
How often do they meet?

356
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,160
Where do they meet?

357
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,920
Yeah, usually once a week.

358
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,120
But it depends on the program stage.

359
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,120
But I would say once a week. Yeah.

360
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,920
And how big is the cohort for each cycle?

361
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,640
We accept eight to 10 startups

362
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,840
each cohort.

363
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,640
And is this in a nonprofit structure

364
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,200
or is the equity involved?

365
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,880
How does it work?

366
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,560
I forgot to mention, yeah.

367
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,080
So, we are an NGO.

368
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,560
We take no equity.

369
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,480
We are a non-profit organization

370
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,960
backed by the government

371
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,240
and other great sponsor

372
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,080
that's taking part in our program.

373
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,360
Yeah.

374
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,520
Wonderful. Wonderful.

375
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,560
And so, how many alumni are there so far?

376
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,080
You've mentioned the 2018

377
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,640
was the third cycle of the hybrid.

378
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,680
So, I'm  imagining by now

379
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,000
there have been a four or five cycles?

380
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,280
Yeah. Now, we are in the midst

381
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,080
of the fifth cohort.

382
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,920
We have about 40 alumni.

383
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,880
Wow.

384
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,900
Yeah. Yeah.

385
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,280
Very very cool. And so,

386
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,160
how many of those alumni

387
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,080
have actually gone on

388
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,320
to raise the seed funds

389
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,480
or have made progress

390
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,400
towards a sustainable startup?

391
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,000
I would say 60%.

392
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,300
Wow. That's incredible.

393
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,360
Yeah. Yeah.

394
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,850
We are on the statistics. Yeah.

395
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,960
Well, it sounds like

396
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,320
you have great statistics.

397
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,760
Noa, I'd love to touch a little bit

398
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,840
in the little amount of time

399
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,360
that we have left,

400
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,520
a little bit about your experience

401
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,480
and your journey.

402
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,480
You've done several things before this.

403
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,160
And I'd love for you to help me

404
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,000
understand a little bit

405
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,200
of why you transitioned from

406
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,360
working in the startup, Tipalti,

407
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,480
and going into

408
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,040
the 8200 Alumni Association,

409
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,320
running an accelerator.

410
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,440
It's a very different job

411
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,880
from managing human resources

412
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,600
back at Tipalti.

413
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,680
What was that experience like

414
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,360
and what insights did you bring

415
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,600
from those experiences

416
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,320
towards your current job with Hybrid?

417
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,680
So, it's a perfect question.

418
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,520
Yeah. So first, Tipalti was

419
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,320
an extremely perfect time for me.

420
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,320
It was a startup school.

421
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,160
I was with Tipalti about four years

422
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,440
in HR position.

423
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,680
I worked very closely to Chen Amit,

424
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,800
which is the co-founder of Tipalti,

425
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,880
and the CEO of course.

426
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,840
Which now I really understand

427
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,760
how he is a leader.

428
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,760
This is what I can say, a perfect leader.

429
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,880
Why do you say that?

430
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,080
Give me one thing,

431
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,920
that when you think about his leadership.

432
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,920
Yeah. So strong personality.

433
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,360
I don't know.

434
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,680
Even though he was

435
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,600
in the California office

436
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,240
and we are in the Israeli office,

437
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,720
he was all the time with us.

438
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,040
All the time we thought

439
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,100
what Chen will say,

440
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,800
what Chen will think of it.

441
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,200
So, yeah. Strong personality.

442
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,640
So, at Tipalti, I was an HR manager.

443
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,360
But I don't know.

444
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,080
But I guess you know that

445
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,200
while you're working on startups

446
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,960
and you're doing much more

447
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,440
than your title means.

448
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,040
And I was pretty much the connector

449
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:18,920
of the Israeli office. The R&D center.

450
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,160
I did lots of project.

451
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,200
And I was lucky enough to join Tipalti

452
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,200
as a 15 employee here in Israel,

453
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,480
working with the core employees

454
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,160
of the company.

455
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,080
It's an amazing company to work in.

456
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,400
Honestly.

457
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,360
And it was an amazing period there.

458
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:48,960
I love it.

459
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,600
Noa, I can't believe that 20 minutes

460
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,840
have gone by way too fast.

461
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,680
But before we leave,

462
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,360
I have to put you on the spot once

463
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,520
and ask you for three words

464
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,560
that you would use to describe yourself.

465
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,320
Or that anybody at Hybrid

466
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,280
would describe you as,

467
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,680
or Chen would describe you as

468
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,560
who is Noa.

469
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,240
Yeah. I think authenticity.

470
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,000
This is would be the first word

471
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,840
Purposeful, or in Hebrew tactless.

472
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,320
Yeah.

473
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,960
And passionate

474
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,680
about things that I'm doing.

475
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,960
I love it. I love it.

476
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,880
So, now you're in the midst

477
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,600
of the fifth cohort.

478
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,480
And how much time do you have left

479
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,880
in this cohort?

480
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,120
So, two months and a half.

481
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,840
Two and a half months, wonderful.

482
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,000
And when is the sixth cohort

483
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,080
going to be applying?

484
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,520
We will start next June.

485
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,080
Our application open

486
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,720
starting from early early early January.

487
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,560
Wonderful. Okay.

488
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,920
So, that's not too far from now.

489
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,160
So, if anybody is listening to this,

490
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,440
and we actually had

491
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,280
a wonderful live chat

492
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,480
with a lot of the participants

493
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,840
from Tech2Peace.

494
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,640
Also a wonderful organization

495
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,280
that has a wonderful mission.

496
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,680
So, I just love these programs

497
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,080
that are bringing communities together

498
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,120
and helping bring up some communities

499
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,320
through the experience

500
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,800
that other communities have had.

501
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,480
Especially in the Israeli ecosystem.

502
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,440
I think it's just inspiring and wonderful.

503
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,880
But Noa, I just want to thank you

504
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,600
for your generosity and for your time.

505
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,320
And continue doing amazing work.

506
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,160
Thank you very much.

507
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,720
Thanks to you, Michael.

508
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,880
Thank you.

509
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,720
Of course. Take care.

510
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:45,840
Bye.
