1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,879
We basically do quantitative

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,879
and qualitative research

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,880
in order to understand how people think.

4
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:34,799
Talia Wolf,

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,719
thank you so much for joining me

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,639
on 20 Minute Leaders.

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,160
Good morning.

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,119
Good morning.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,079
Thank you so much for having me.

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,679
Chief optimizer at the Getuplift.

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,920
What does it mean to be an optimizer?

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,440
Well, we help brands,

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,360
high growth brands,

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,280
optimize their funnels in their websites.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,200
So, essentially, turning more

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,600
of their traffic into customers,

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,640
leads, users and so on.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,120
So, the idea is to leave the traffic as is

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,920
and basically optimize the website

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,360
whether if it's the copy,

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,800
the user experience,

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,960
the journey itself,

23
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:13,879
the visuals and so on.

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,120
And run A/B tests in order to see

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,920
what actually increases convergence.

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,520
So, it sounds exciting.

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,600
Conversions are incredibly challenging.

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
And I'm excited to learn more

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,680
about the space, about the challenges,

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,720
about the creative solutions around it.

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,080
But even more exciting than that

32
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,480
is jumping from a plane.

33
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,880
So, Talia, how do you get to do

34
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:35,359
a thousand jumps from an airplane?

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,120
How does that happen?

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,160
You have to be crazy.

37
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,840
No. I don't know.

38
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,040
I went to see a friend of mine

39
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,080
jumping out of a plane.

40
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,480
She was doing a course.

41
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,920
I saw it. And I'm like,

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,520
okay, yeah, this is cool.

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,800
And that was basically it.

44
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,640
Yeah. I've skydived.

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,280
I sure have skydive a lot in the US too.

46
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,720
So, in the area of California,

47
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,760
quite a bit, and where else, Chicago.

48
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,840
But why do a course?

49
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,880
I skydived twice or three times.

50
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,560
And you know,

51
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,640
it's an exhilarating journey.

52
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,440
I almost pee my pants every time

53
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,640
and I keep asking myself,

54
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,760
why did I do this to myself.

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,640
But then, I am always happy that I did.

56
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,200
But what motivates you to go

57
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,680
and do a real course

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,600
and be certified in that?

59
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,480
You know what,

60
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,280
it's probably the most amazing feeling

61
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,440
you can ever get.

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,840
And the best feeling for me

63
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,440
is that moment when you leave the plane.

64
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,960
It's not even the fall itself

65
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,920
when we're doing all these

66
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,680
elaborate cool things or flying a canopy.

67
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,480
It's actually that moment

68
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,280
when you are leaving the plane.

69
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:50,039
And what's cool about it is that

70
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,320
I mean, for me at least,

71
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,960
my brain's working 24 hours.

72
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,240
So, I'm constantly thinking and working

73
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,560
and constantly thinking about things.

74
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,320
And when you jump out of a plane,

75
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,680
there is pure two minutes of nothing.

76
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,040
And it's not just nothing like a void.

77
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,240
It's nothing, it's filled with calm.

78
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,160
It's just amazing.

79
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,320
And of course, it's the adrenaline

80
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,960
and all the fun and jumping with friends

81
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,440
and competitions and all that.

82
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,840
But the calm, the I'm not thinking

83
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,720
about anything right now

84
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,360
except to this moment.

85
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,720
Do you understand the absurdity

86
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,440
of how you're describing

87
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,840
that calm feeling

88
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,200
of jumping out of an airplane,

89
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,720
falling at an acceleration

90
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,000
of 10 meters per second?

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,920
And you're saying, but it's the calm,

92
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,520
it's two minutes of calmness.

93
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,080
So, anybody that's listening to this

94
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,840
that hasn't jumped off of a plane,

95
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,600
I mean, I can testify somewhat,

96
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,280
I think you're being

97
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,600
completely delusional,

98
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,720
that it's a calm experience.

99
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,800
And I scream my heart out the whole time.

100
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,120
But I'm sure that, hopefully,

101
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:53,639
I'll get to that point one day.

102
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,199
I'll meditate here on the couch

103
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,599
in the meantime.

104
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,359
But thank you for sharing.

105
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,560
Talia, why is conversion so hard?

106
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,240
And what is conversion, first of all,

107
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,640
to whoever doesn't necessarily

108
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,320
really grasp it?

109
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:09,960
All right.

110
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,160
So, essentially when

111
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
you start a business,

112
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,552
whether if it's an e-commerce business

113
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:16,440
or maybe it's a SaaS product,

114
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,880
you're trying to get conversions,

115
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,400
you're trying to get more sales.

116
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,480
Maybe even if you're a consultant,

117
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,840
you're trying to get leads.

118
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,400
If you're a SaaS company,

119
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:24,880
then you're trying

120
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,840
to get users and people

121
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,240
to sign up for a free trial

122
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,400
or schedule a demo.

123
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,440
Those aren't conversions.

124
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:31,839
That's what your company decides on.

125
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,879
And you're driving traffic.

126
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,319
You're spending a ton of money in ads

127
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,200
on Google, on Facebook or doing SEO

128
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:40,559
or content writing in order to drive

129
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,879
as many people as possible

130
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,879
to your website or to your landing pages

131
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,479
in order to convert people into leads

132
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,239
or into sign ups and so on.

133
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,199
And the thing is that,

134
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,640
for many, many years,

135
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,400
most companies spent a lot of money

136
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,360
on driving that traffic to the website,

137
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,280
but didn't think about

138
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,400
what happens when people

139
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,120
actually arrive on the website.

140
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,320
How do you convince people to sign up.

141
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,640
And what's really interesting is that,

142
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,280
these days we live in a world

143
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,920
where we see 40,000 messages a day.

144
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:12,559
I mean, everyone's targeting us.

145
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,040
Everyone's trying to get our attention.

146
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,920
So, how do you actually

147
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,440
stand out in that crowd

148
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,360
and get your prospect to say,

149
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,960
yes, this company looks interesting

150
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,080
and I'm not going to go

151
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,680
and look at the five other competitors.

152
00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:27,359
And that's conversion optimization.

153
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,480
It's about optimizing the experience

154
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,640
that people go for

155
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,120
when they get your website and funnel

156
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,520
so that you can get more conversions.

157
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,000
And so, what are the main attributes

158
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,480
that would make me

159
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,680
as a consumer, first of all,

160
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,000
and before we even talk about

161
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,240
the marketing, me as a consumer,

162
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,800
what are some of the main

163
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:47,799
rationalizations

164
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,200
that I go through,

165
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,120
or what is the behavior that I exhibit

166
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,840
as I'm being targeted

167
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,400
that would maybe enforce me

168
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,800
to go in one direction or another?

169
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,480
Because I think, that is the foundation

170
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,240
of this whole issue. Right?

171
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:01,039
What motivates me.

172
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,080
I worked with Dan Ariely quite a bit

173
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,000
with irrational lives.

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,520
And so, thinking about consumer behavior

175
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,720
has been a lifelong passion.

176
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,240
But I'm excited to hear your take

177
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,280
on from conversion standpoint.

178
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,080
100%.

179
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
So, most times when you think about

180
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,360
optimizing for conversion, people think,

181
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,280
okay, I'll make a button bigger

182
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,440
or I'll change the headline

183
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,200
and that's going to work.

184
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,000
But actually,

185
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,320
the process that we've developed,

186
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,040
the methodology that I develop

187
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,639
is called emotional targeting.

188
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,399
And it's exactly based

189
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,439
on everything that Dan Ariely does.

190
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,880
It's all about understanding

191
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:34,679
how people make decisions.

192
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,319
When you understand

193
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,519
how people make decisions,

194
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,159
the real intent,

195
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,759
the different psychological triggers

196
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,879
and biases that we have in our brain,

197
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,119
it's easier for you to understand

198
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,680
what kind of experience

199
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,960
someone needs to go through

200
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,720
in order to convert.

201
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,320
It's never going to be the same.

202
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
But you have different target audiences

203
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,320
that act in different ways.

204
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,160
So, if you can understand the pains,

205
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,520
the challenges, the different roadblocks

206
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,560
that people are going through,

207
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:01,839
and most importantly,

208
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,400
the desired outcome,

209
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,520
what is that emotional feeling

210
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,560
that people are looking for.

211
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,600
And I'll give you an example.

212
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,480
Please.

213
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,240
You're not buying a shirt.

214
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,000
You're buying self-esteem.

215
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,400
You're not buying insurance.

216
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,040
Basically you're not buying

217
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,720
a piece of paper for insurance.

218
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,360
You're buying security.

219
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,840
You're buying peace of mind.

220
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,680
And that is basically

221
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,880
the difference between

222
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,600
just changing an element on the page

223
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,760
and hoping that it will get more sign ups

224
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,760
versus actually thinking about

225
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,440
what is that emotional drive.

226
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:40,839
What is the emotional intent

227
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,600
behind a decision and then

228
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,640
creating an experience for that.

229
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,040
So, it just requires a lot of

230
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,000
research and understanding intent

231
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,160
on how people make decisions,

232
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,800
just like you mentioned.

233
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,120
Right.

234
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,080
How do you get started

235
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,920
even researching this?

236
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,440
So, becoming somewhat of an expert

237
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,960
in this idea of rationality?

238
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,800
Because these analogies

239
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,360
that you just made,

240
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,200
you're not buying a T-shirt,

241
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,600
you're buying self-esteem,

242
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,720
you're not buying insurance

243
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,480
as a piece of paper,

244
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,000
you're buying comfort and peace of mind.

245
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,280
It's a process.

246
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,720
Not ,you know,

247
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
it's not like the average person

248
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,280
can just come and say,

249
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,680
okay, I'm understanding how people think.

250
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:18,079
How do you get started with that?

251
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,360
Yeah.

252
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,999
Well, it's funny because

253
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,839
when I started out

254
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,999
with conversion optimization,

255
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,119
I tried the other thing.

256
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,319
I tried reading blog post

257
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,759
and following best practices

258
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,919
and asking people for their opinion.

259
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,079
And that tanked.

260
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,279
Like literally I lost

261
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,288
a hundred thousand dollar client

262
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,039
because of that.

263
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,319
Really? Wow.

264
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,119
Well, that's how, you know,

265
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,279
when you get started,

266
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,119
you try different things and you fail.

267
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,679
And that's great.

268
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,119
That's the life of the entrepreneur.

269
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,199
But thanks to those fails

270
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,479
and to trying these things

271
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,560
and that treadmill of just kind of,

272
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,440
it's not even a treadmill.

273
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,400
It's a hamster wheel.

274
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,640
You keep going over and over

275
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,480
trying the same things that don't work.

276
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,440
So, what I did is

277
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,240
I basically started researching

278
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,080
how people make decisions in life.

279
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,680
And I understood that what was missing

280
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,720
was that psychology part of it.

281
00:09:02,721 --> 00:09:04,399
So, you can't just wake up and say,

282
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,399
oh, okay, I know how people think.

283
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,159
You have to do a methodological research.

284
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,599
So we do surveys,

285
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,959
and we use heat maps,

286
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,119
and we do interviews,

287
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,480
and we use eye tracking

288
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,400
and we use data from Google Analytics.

289
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,160
And we basically do quantitative

290
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
and qualitative research

291
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,240
in order to understand

292
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,400
how people think.

293
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,360
Now, what's good and what's on my side

294
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,280
is A/B testing.

295
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,040
Because I can come and say,

296
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,120
I think the emotional drivers are social,

297
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,320
let's say it's social image.

298
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,520
I want social image

299
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,720
as a psychological trigger,

300
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,160
which basically means that we want,

301
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,720
we care about

302
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,360
what other people think about us.

303
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,120
On the other side,

304
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,600
you could have self image, which is,

305
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,280
I want to feel better about myself.

306
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
But let's say

307
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,720
that we've chosen social image.

308
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,520
That's what we want to test.

309
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:53,799
So, I'll create a variation

310
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,799
that focuses on social image,

311
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,199
on the outcome that is social image

312
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,640
and how other people will feel about you.

313
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,040
And you test it,

314
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,560
and you see the data that comes in

315
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,480
and you see if it works

316
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,280
and if it doesn't.

317
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,480
And even if it doesn't,

318
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,080
you've still learn something.

319
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,280
So, it's really just about research

320
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,400
and testing all the time.

321
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
That makes a lot of sense.

322
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,360
So, walk me through the process.

323
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,680
You're getting a new client

324
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,600
and you're starting to work.

325
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,120
And obviously,

326
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,400
I think one of the impressive things here

327
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,480
is that you have to context

328
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,600
which all the time between

329
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,960
different types of clients.

330
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,160
Right?

331
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,240
One time, it's a social image.

332
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,000
And other time, it's a different trigger

333
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,520
or a cognitive bias

334
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,160
that you are trying to invoke.

335
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,840
And so, what is the process

336
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,280
that you and your team have to go through

337
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,360
in order to, you know, first of all,

338
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,280
optimize yourself towards that problem

339
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,600
and then the process with that company

340
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,640
of actually finding

341
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,440
a solution that satisfies?

342
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,560
Yeah. That's a great question.

343
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,880
Because there's also biases

344
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,960
that we live in.

345
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,640
Even we go to analyze things,

346
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,240
we have our own biases and the things

347
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,640
that we think are going to work.

348
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,360
One of the things that we do is,

349
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,000
when we start working with a new client

350
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,920
is we split the work between

351
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,200
different people in the teams.

352
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,520
So, for example,

353
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,840
if we do an audit on a website,

354
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,480
then a lot of it

355
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,320
includes running surveys,

356
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,520
interviews,

357
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,520
something called review, mining,

358
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,240
competitor analysis, work all that stuff.

359
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,920
But we get different people doing it.

360
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,280
And then we compare out notes

361
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,600
and see if we reach the same conclusions

362
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,480
or similar conclusions.

363
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
So, it's a process

364
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,960
that really begins with people

365
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,480
and ends with people.

366
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,320
And I can tell you that

367
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,160
with various companies

368
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,880
and clients that we've worked with,

369
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,280
we've found that many times

370
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,600
without talking to each other

371
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,800
throughout the process,

372
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,200
we each come with our own conclusions

373
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,320
that turn out to be very similar.

374
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,240
And if they're not,

375
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,440
then we'll propose two different tests.

376
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,560
So, it's a very cool way

377
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,160
to go about the research and to say,

378
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,560
okay, here's what we're looking.

379
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,240
Here's what we're seeing on the website.

380
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,120
We're also using quantitative data

381
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:57,559
so we know what's going on.

382
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,040
We know how people are behaving

383
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,000
on the website,

384
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,760
now we have to basically attach

385
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,680
the psychological part to it.

386
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,320
So, it's search and testing all the time.

387
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,680
Sure.

388
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,960
And how early

389
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,960
do usually work with the companies?

390
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,680
Are these companies that are already huge

391
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,440
and they have thousands

392
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,400
of potential customers?

393
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,480
Or are these also startups that are just

394
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,200
trying to get their product market fit

395
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,960
and understanding what is the product

396
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,560
that we should be aiming for,

397
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,960
given a target audience

398
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,600
that we believe in?

399
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,120
Yeah.

400
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,240
So, for our client work,

401
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,560
we usually work with companies

402
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,720
that have a minimum

403
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,120
of three hundred conversions a month.

404
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,560
And we do that because

405
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,280
in order to run a viable test

406
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,600
as a statistically significant test,

407
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,400
we need to have about

408
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,120
150 conversions per variation.

409
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,960
So, that is the best fit.

410
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,760
So, it's usually

411
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,640
more high growth companies.

412
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,480
However, we do have

413
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,880
courses and when we do

414
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,280
the courses and the trainings,

415
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,680
they are for more of the entrepreneurs

416
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,880
and startups that are

417
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,800
just getting started

418
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:00,359
and want to learn how to do these things

419
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,680
themselves so they can set themselves

420
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,480
up for success.

421
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,520
And then later, hopefully,

422
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,640
when they get to that stage,

423
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,080
they can always hire us

424
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,400
in order to take them to the next level.

425
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,160
Right. That makes a lot of sense.

426
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,200
So, what are some things that

427
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,360
early stage companies,

428
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,120
young entrepreneurs can already do

429
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,240
as they're building their product,

430
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,040
as they're gaining conversions

431
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,320
in order to get into this

432
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,600
conversion optimization mindset?

433
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,640
Because obviously,

434
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,320
it's great to be able to come in

435
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,560
and have Getuplift come

436
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,040
and help when you're in hypergrowth.

437
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,120
But it sounds to me like this

438
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,200
is almost like a strategy

439
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,120
or a talent that you want to improve on,

440
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,320
on every step of the journey

441
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,920
as the leader in the company?

442
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
100%.

443
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,800
You know, what's really cool is that

444
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,960
being that small startup

445
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,320
that just getting started,

446
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,000
even if it's in a very crowded industry,

447
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,760
gives you a lot of advantage.

448
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,160
And the advantage is that you are leaner

449
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,560
and you can move fast

450
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,880
and you can do your research,

451
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,480
which a lot of companies now

452
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,320
that are huge and are very big

453
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,200
and very well known

454
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,520
don't have the capacity or time to do

455
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,280
or even the people to do it.

456
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,760
And even they did imply start doing it,

457
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,280
it would take them a whole year.

458
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,920
You, as a startup or a founder,

459
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,960
can already start running

460
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,640
those researchers in terms of

461
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,280
surveying your potential customers,

462
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,400
doing interviews,

463
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,840
doing the jobs to be done,

464
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
framework of Google,

465
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,640
that it's a super important

466
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,760
framework to do.

467
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,240
You could be interviewing people.

468
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,800
You could be doing review mining.

469
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,640
You can really go deep.

470
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,520
And what's really cool about this process

471
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,720
is that you end up finding

472
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,160
your unique selling proposition.

473
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,640
And that unique selling proposition

474
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:44,959
is going to help you actually stand out

475
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,159
in front of all those competitors

476
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,359
and the big companies in the industry.

477
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,800
So, you can get started immediately

478
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:54,559
by going back to basics.

479
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,239
And before you start planning

480
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,319
any landing page,

481
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,279
any ad or even your website,

482
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,479
first, do the research

483
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,559
in order to understand

484
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,879
who your customer is,

485
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,879
what their desired outcomes are,

486
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,679
what are their pains and concerns.

487
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,959
And make sure that everything

488
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,120
that you create is about the customer.

489
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,520
It's about them and their desired outcome.

490
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:14,800
Right.

491
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,760
I was actually introduced to getting

492
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,480
the job that needs to be done

493
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,640
back at the venture capital class

494
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,280
at Stanford.

495
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,240
But I would love for you

496
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,080
to tell us a little

497
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,880
bit about this concept

498
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,240
and about this this

499
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,520
mentality as a founder

500
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,600
and entrepreneur, thinking about what is

501
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,120
the job that needs to be done

502
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,680
with the customer at the forefront.

503
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,480
What is that framework?

504
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,920
Yeah. I mean, at the end of the day,

505
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,000
what you're trying to figure out is

506
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
what is the job that your prospect

507
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,040
is trying to get done with your solution.

508
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,360
Right.

509
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,480
And I think that many times people think,

510
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,160
oh, you know, if they're using a,

511
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,640
let's say they're using Slack,

512
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,320
they're trying to get work done,

513
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,440
or Trello, they're trying

514
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,760
to manage the project.

515
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,400
But it's rarely that simple.

516
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,320
It's not that they're trying

517
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,800
to manage a project.

518
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,760
It's that they're trying

519
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,880
to maybe save time,

520
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,600
maybe reduce friction within the company.

521
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Maybe they're trying to,

522
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,680
essentially what they're doing is

523
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,480
they're trying to get to an end result.

524
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,120
That is the desired outcome

525
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,360
I keep talking about.

526
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,880
The easiest way to explain this is that

527
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,440
if you are a parent

528
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,480
and you are now thinking

529
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,480
about buying a product for your child.

530
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,680
So, maybe it's a toy,

531
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,760
maybe it's something

532
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,840
that they need to build,

533
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,880
or maybe you're planning

534
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,200
a birthday party for your child.

535
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,920
There's a lot of things

536
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,960
that come into place here.

537
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,320
It's not just about the act of,

538
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,040
here, I now have plates for the party,

539
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,800
or I now have a toy to give to this kid.

540
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,440
It's more about that desired outcome

541
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,080
and what's going to happen at the end.

542
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,760
My kid is going to be happy,

543
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,520
or other parents are going to know

544
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,000
that I am a great parent,

545
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,360
or I'm going to feel great

546
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,280
about my parenting skills.

547
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,520
So, it's always about that job

548
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,640
that people are trying to get done.

549
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,000
And there's a whole framework

550
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,280
that really helps you.

551
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,920
What's good about this specific framework

552
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,480
is just that it takes you away

553
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,840
from the personas,

554
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,960
which is 90% made up.

555
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,920
And then it takes you into a real way

556
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,640
to framework and understand

557
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,560
who exactly is your customer,

558
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,760
what are they trying to get done

559
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,240
and how you should be speaking to them.

560
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,480
Right.

561
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,920
That makes a lot of sense.

562
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,280
Talia, why are you so excited about this?

563
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,200
Why are you so excited about

564
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,320
conversion optimization?

565
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,160
Obviously, I think,

566
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,640
it's an exhilarating journey

567
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,200
seeing every day, different client

568
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,880
or every few weeks a different client,

569
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,240
and solving a different problem

570
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,160
and seeing that impact.

571
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,800
But where's that passion come from?

572
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,960
It's funny that you ask this

573
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,800
because I used to run

574
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,080
a conversion optimization agency

575
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,520
and we sold the agency

576
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,200
and I joined a startup company.

577
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,160
And I worked in this startup company

578
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,040
as a CMO for about,

579
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,640
I don't know, eight months.

580
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,800
And the whole eight months,

581
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,720
all I wanted to do

582
00:18:01,721 --> 00:18:03,319
was conversion optimization.

583
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,480
And I ended up leaving that company

584
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,160
and going back to starting my own

585
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,080
consulting business

586
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:09,719
for conversion optimization.

587
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,120
So, I think, first of all,

588
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,720
I found my passion.

589
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,160
And I really do love what I do.

590
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,439
I love trying to understand people

591
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,559
and how they make decisions.

592
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,400
And most of all,

593
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,480
I love helping my clients.

594
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,640
I just really enjoy it

595
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,040
and going on that journey with them.

596
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,000
So, I'm just really passionate

597
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,600
about what I do.

598
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,000
And how much of that would you say

599
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,880
of your time you spend

600
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,280
on the psychological side

601
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,600
versus the quantitative side

602
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,480
that you're getting?

603
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,680
And when I say the quantitative,

604
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,360
I mean the Google Analytics

605
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,240
and the A/B testing

606
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,280
with the landing pages

607
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,320
and the messaging

608
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,520
versus sitting down and saying,

609
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,640
okay, let's figure out

610
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,960
what is this cognitive bias

611
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,000
that we're invoking,

612
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,880
what are the emotions

613
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,400
that our user is experiencing,

614
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,600
you're probably also encouraged doing

615
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,840
a lot of user interviews

616
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,880
and customer interviews

617
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,040
to understand them.

618
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,560
But which part

619
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,200
do you spend more time on usually?

620
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,360
It depends.

621
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,160
Mostly what happens is

622
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,280
we always start with quantitative.

623
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,000
So, we'll start with Google Analytics

624
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,720
and Heat Maps in order to understand

625
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,400
where the problem is

626
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,520
and what needs fixing.

627
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,280
And then we'll use qualitative data

628
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,800
in order to answer how to fix that.

629
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,760
So, Google Analytics

630
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,040
is a great tool to use

631
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,720
in order to understand, like,

632
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,560
hey, there is a problem on this page

633
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,080
or there's a problem in this funnel.

634
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,440
But it doesn't tell you

635
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,120
why that problem is happening.

636
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,280
So, then we'll use qualitative data

637
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,800
in order to answer that question

638
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,440
and figure out,

639
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,080
okay, so we know there's a problem

640
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,800
on the pricing page,

641
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,120
or we know there's a problem in checkout.

642
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,200
Or we know there's a problem

643
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,400
on the home page,

644
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,400
how do we fix that.

645
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,200
What is the problem,

646
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,800
and identifying it and then solving it.

647
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,560
So, most of the time, the biggest part

648
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,000
is the qualitative research

649
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,880
because it takes more time.

650
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,160
And it's about solving a problem.

651
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,480
The quantitative is more of a way

652
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,640
of informing ourselves and understanding

653
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,320
what needs to be fixed.

654
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,440
Right. That makes a lot of sense.

655
00:19:59,440 --> 00:19:59,680
By the way,

656
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,280
do you have any interesting case study

657
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,800
or any specific

658
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,840
occurrence with an insight

659
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,840
as to something that surprised you

660
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,520
along the journey

661
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,160
that you were working with the client,

662
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,640
you were trying to solve something

663
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,920
with conversion and then you realized

664
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,360
that it was something like really weird,

665
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,600
obscure that without that research,

666
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,480
you were necessarily fine?

667
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,680
You know,

668
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,760
one of my recent

669
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,640
tests, I worked with

670
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,800
social media marketing examiner,

671
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,000
socia lmedia examiner.

672
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,880
They've got the social media examiner

673
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,680
which is the blog

674
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,400
and the social media marketing world,

675
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,800
which is that conference.

676
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,640
So, SME, which is social media examiner,

677
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,600
one of the biggest blogs

678
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,160
in the world for social media,

679
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,120
they hired us in order to help them

680
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,720
sell more tickets for their conference

681
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,080
in San Diego.

682
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,000
And when I looked at their landing page,

683
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,480
it wasn't actually

684
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,400
a classic landing page.

685
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,720
It's a blog post. It's essentially

686
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,800
a five thousand word blog post.

687
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,120
Wow.

688
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,920
And I'm looking at it.

689
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,800
And I kept thinking,

690
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,000
we need to optimize this.

691
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,440
We need a classic landing page.

692
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,440
We need to have a header, have this,

693
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,640
have real call to action buttons.

694
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,240
And in the end,

695
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,600
when we did our research,

696
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,080
we realized that the actual people

697
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,000
who are coming to this page

698
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,440
don't need that at all.

699
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,960
What they actually need

700
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,480
is to have this specific blog.

701
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,440
And what we did, which is funny,

702
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,560
is that after doing this research,

703
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,160
we understood that what was missing

704
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,560
was even more content.

705
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,240
So, we added a whole section about

706
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,320
the pains that they're going through,

707
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,160
all the stuff that isn't

708
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,760
working for them,

709
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,200
the pains, the roadblocks,

710
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,960
the challenges and basically painted

711
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
the new picture that could be.

712
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,760
And we actually by just adding more copy

713
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,360
to the website, to that page,

714
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:52,239
we actually got a 15% increase in sales.

715
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,120
So, it's really cool to see that

716
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,080
it's not always the stuff

717
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,160
that you think it's going to be

718
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,560
and the stuff that's most like

719
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,880
what everyone else is doing.

720
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,760
Because any other conference you look at

721
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,200
have a really cool,

722
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,640
classic looking landing page,

723
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,920
and this is very different.

724
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,680
That's fascinating.

725
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,000
Talia, thank you so much for coming

726
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:12,959
and for inspiring me these 20 minutes.

727
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,759
Before we leave,

728
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,119
I have to ask you the hardest

729
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,519
and most important question,

730
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,519
which is three words

731
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,320
that you would use to describe yourself.

732
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,679
Okay. I'm going to say passionate,

733
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,199
because you can hear much of them.

734
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,639
I'm going to say dedicated.

735
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,760
And I am going to say geek.

736
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,520
I love that.

737
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,080
Passionate, dedicated and geek.

738
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,560
Talia, thank you very, very much.

739
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,000
This is wonderful.

740
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,400
Stay safe and stay healthy.

741
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,920
Same to you.

742
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:52,560
Thank you for having me.
