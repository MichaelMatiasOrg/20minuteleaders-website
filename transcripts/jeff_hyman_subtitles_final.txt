Okay. Wonderful. Jeff Hyman, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Thanks for having me. Really really great to have you. You know, you had such interesting positions in the legal space, but also in the HR space. So I believe you started, you were the general counsel and you started the HR at Pebble Technology, which I love. I backed both Kickstarters. Incredible. Thank you And then ... senior director at Google, advisor to several companies. I think Boosted Boards was one of them? Yeah. It's one of my dreams. It's one of my life goals to be able to ride on the Boosted board, but I'm terrified. So, maybe you'll ease my concern. And you're an adjunct professor at Santa Clara University teaching about the legal aspect of startups. Jeff, what does that mean? What does that mean the legal aspect of startups? Well, in the course at the law school, what we do is I try to present to the students what the arc of legal issues are that startups face from formation to raising capital and dealing with VCs. And then key issues about contracts and hiring people and employment law issues. And then ultimately working towards M&A and going public. And throughout it the focus of the class is really about educating the students a bit on some of the key legal issues at every one of those steps, but it's really about how do you function in a startup as a lawyer and what's the most useful way to be a partner to all of the other business stakeholders in a company in charting solutions to navigate through all those legal issues. So, take me through this lifecycle from you're joining at Pebble as very early employee, right? I think 35th employee. What does that mean being a good partner at an early stage startup? And then take me through the journey of the startup up until the IPO. So, I think it's really that, it's an important distinction between being like a law firm lawyer or even working at a big company legal department like I did it at Intel or Apple where, when you're a huge company you have so much at stake, so much at risk and a lot to protect and to worry about. And what a lot of those companies’ legal practices are really about is identifying and managing risk, whereas in a startup you have very little to protect and it's really about you're trying to do something new and you're trying to create and build. And so the orientation I think there is, and this certainly was my attitude when I got to Pebble, you show up and there is no legal department, there's nothing. And there's a business that's trying to accomplish something. And really, your job as the general counsel or legal counsel is understand what the business is trying to do and figure out how can you help make that happen. And along the way, how do you help build the company and make sure that the company is making really smart choices about how it's pursuing those business opportunities in a smart way. How it's complying with the laws that it needs to comply with or at least making really informed choices when it's not. And sometimes that's part of what startups have to do too. But then also being really smart about, particularly in a technology startup, you have a great idea and now you're executing to it. How do you do that in a way that's gonna be protectable so that you have a differentiated advantage and you're able to protect that differentiation sometimes through intellectual property, sometimes through how you set up contracts and relationships with external parties, etc. So, there's a lot. Yeah. I mean, looking in the background, so besides being a part of these huge companies, very successful companies, you've taken a very active role within those more Internet of things devices like wearable technology, like the Boosted boards. So, I'm guessing there, the IP plays a pretty strong part, right? Because especially today you create some new wearable device, and all of a sudden across the sea on the east, you have companies doing almost the same thing for much cheaper. So, what are the different challenges there that you've seen with these different companies that you've worked with? Well, that's and that's really, I think, especially in the hardware space, that's really one of the big challenges. You can have If you looked at like a Pebble watch or, I had the same thought when GoPro came out with their camera, when you tear those devices down, they're just made up full of commodity off the shelf parts that anybody can tear it open and copy it. And if they can offer it at a lower price because they have cheaper labor, whatever the case may be, you're in big trouble. So, if you wanna have something that's gonna give you a sustained differentiated advantage to compete, you've got to bring something that isn't so easy to knock off. And what are those things? Well, at Pebble, one of the things that we had was we had software. We had a distinct UI. We had a set of software features. We had a really impressive back-end cloud based systems. We had a technology community. Yeah, I developed apps for my Pebble. Yeah. So, those are the kinds of things that if you're smart about how you do it, those can start to create moats that will defend your competitive advantage so long as people like the product. I mean ultimately all these things, they all devolve down to the basic question of: Are you doing something that consumers want? That's the ultimate challenge, but I think that you can be smart about how you decide whether you're gonna try to protect things through patents and there's criteria and strategies around figuring out that. There's also a lot of strategy around when there are things that are actually hard about what makes your product work or how you assemble your product, and if you keep those things secret, you can give yourself some advantage as well. So how you maintain your trade secrets is important. So, there's lots of different strategies and law plays a part of figuring out how effective a moat can you build around the business. And then how does that play, though, into your role as leading the HR at a company like Pebble? Because in my mind, legal and HR don't necessarily go hand in hand. So, it's really yeah, it's really interesting. When I joined the Pebble the first day I showed up there was a recruiter and he asked me to go into a conference room and he said, "Hey, you know, you're also in charge of HR. There's some things that you need to know about." And so, it isn't actually that strange because the intersection, there's a lot of HR that's really about not only complying with a whole host of employment laws, which are really important, but a lot of those laws are there when you think about it to protect and promote the interests of the team and the employees. And when you think in a startup about what's something that's really important, well, it's the team and the culture of the company. And so for me, I had a really natural interest and passion for doing the HR work. I still love doing it. And I was really, I was thrilled to get to wear both of those hats because sometimes when you're doing the legal work, it can be a little isolating from the team writ large, and you're doing things that are important but maybe don't resonate with everybody. When you work in HR, you're doing stuff that affects everybody all the time and the feedback loop is instantaneous. You hear from people all the time which I enjoyed most of the time. I love it. I love it. Okay. And now I'm gonna be starting a startup, hopefully sooner rather than later. And how can I as a founder, as an entrepreneur, I know nothing about legal. How can I even go and approach doing things the right way and understanding and really complying with the right things, but also thinking strategically about protecting the stuff that I'm doing? Do I bring somebody in-house? Do I go outside to a different company? Sort of what's the best practices with your insight over years in this industry? Well, now what you're gonna do is call me. Okay. Okay, it's done. That's it. So that's, you know it's funny 'cause that's really what this consulting business that I run now is really, in a way, it's sort of my solution to the problem that you just raised is. When you're starting out and it's early days, it doesn't make sense to hire a full time lawyer at a really early stage startup. But there are so many things that even in the early stages that founders want to get right and they need, they're not intuitive. Most founders are technical. Sometimes they're sales or marketing oriented people, but there's no reason to assume that you would have this very specialized knowledge and the wisdom of experience to know what are some of the better solutions than others. So, you can read a lot on the web and then I think a lot of founders do, and some of it's good, and some if it's not. There's lots and lots of law firms you can go to. And law firms are great at, if you go to a good one, there's a lot of subject matter knowledge, but there isn't always a lot of practical wisdom and sort of street smarts. And so, ultimately, I think what you want as a founder is to say, "Okay, don't just tell me what the law is, but tell me practically what's the smartest way to get from where I am to where you understand I wanna go." And I think that's really what makes for a great in-house lawyer or even somebody like me who's a part time GC and head of HR for lots of startups. Somebody who brings that perspective up in reality like you're always weighing risk against benefit. Right. And sometimes, it can be expensive to comply with every single detail or to try to tackle all the problems at once. And you have to prioritize. So, having that practical experience to know, like, what do I really need to do right now? What can wait? What's a good enough solution vs. the Cadillac? And you don't always need the Cadillac. That's really the kind of practical experience that you need. But even in, especially in legal, you have to specialize in a lot of these things, and especially when you're talking about intellectual property It sounds like you almost have to be somewhat of an expert on the technology that this company is developing. And you're going from smartwatches to electric scooter boards to Google, Intel, Apple. How do you understand the technology? And how much of a deep dive do you actually need to have within each of these realms in order to be giving really good advice? Well, it's one of the things that's really fun about working in the Valley is if you're interested in technology and in business, which I am both of those, as well as the law. I've had a lot of people I've worked with say that I'm a business person who happens also to be a lawyer. And I try to think of it that way, too. So, over a number of years, you work on a lot of different kinds of things and you learn from hopefully really smart mentors and practitioners. But then, yeah, you do have to learn the technology because it it can be relevant sometimes And sometimes it's not. I mean, to help address employment law issues, it's not necessary that you know much about the business or the product or the technology. But certainly when you're thinking about intellectual property matters or even structuring partnerships with outside companies, particularly if it involves like manufacturing or licensing technologies, you do need to understand at some level. You don't have to be an engineer, but the more you understand, I think it can help you a lot. Definitely. And so, looking over all these companies and all these years in your industry, what are some of the common pitfalls that you see founders or entrepreneurs make along the way that could be avoided? I'm looking at myself, things that I wanna write down that I wanna make sure that I do things right as I go along my own entrepreneurial journey. Gosh. Every startup that I've worked with, and I'm working with four companies right now, they all struggle with a lot of people related issues. A lot of employment law issues. Interesting. And I think they also struggle with how to build and manage teams and do some of the compensation strategy. Like all of that people related stuff is a challenge. And that's partly because none of it's intuitive at all. Like there's nothing intuitive about employment law. It's detailed and in California it's shocking and surprising what the law actually requires sometimes. It's very unclear to both sides, right? Both the employer and the employee It can be. It absolutely can be. And there can be a tremendous amount of problem when the relationship goes south. And that can happen, right. So, getting a lot on this people related issues is a challenge. I think also, that when founders early on start engaging with the outside world, whether it's through contracts or through collaboration, talking about technology developing technology with outsiders, getting that right with both in terms of the contracts that the companies are signing and the contracts that they're not signing and putting in place is sort of another area where I see a lot of opportunity to benefit from working with someone who can guide you through that. I think there's, naturally there's a desire to, you see a problem you wanna go solve it. And there's a smart person or a company that's got some technology that's interesting. Let's just dive in and solve the technical problem. But if you don't set that up right, and especially sometimes before the work begins, you can really be creating some difficult problems that you're gonna have to dig out of after the fact. 100%. Is it very common in your industry to go broad and being at four companies at the same time? Or do people at your caliber usually go and do a deep dive into one company? It's a mix, I think. I mean, clearly what I'm doing I think is not the conventional path. I mean, I've done being a part of big companies and smaller ones full time. By the way, what's the difference in that? So, being in huge companies like Google, and then being in small companies like Pebble. Give me a little bit of a taste of how different it is from your perspective. Well, so, if you think about the time that I was at Apple, I was part of the hardware legal team. And within the whole legal team, there was the software legal team, and there was Internet services which at the time was iTunes, and the bookstore and all of that. And then there was the privacy team and the litigation team and the patent team. And so, the whole point though, is you start getting specialization and a more narrow focus. So, even while I was a senior person and ultimately led the hardware legal team at Apple, I had nothing to do with all the really interesting things that Apple was doing in software and services and it's completely cool ways of setting up the Apple stores and how Apple was selling. I had nothing to do with that. Yeah. So, that focus and specialization and sort of staying in your lane is sort of the hallmark of working at a big legal department. And I had done that kind of work for a long time at Intel and Apple. And I was desperate to get out of that narrow lane and have the breadth of all the issues. And also, when you're at an Intel or an Apple, it's like a giant aircraft carrier. And it will be just fine whether you're there or not. And it turns very slowly. I wanted to go to an early stage company where whether I showed up to work or not and the work that I was doing was actually gonna make an important value impact to the company. And so, that's really what led me to go to Pebble and have my first startup experience. And I've worked with many startups since then. What I like about playing the role I play now as a part time GC and head of HR is you get an exposure At any one time you've got this group of companies you're working with So, there's really interesting variety, different technologies. All my companies are very very different from each other in their focus. And you get this breadth of people and experiences and you're constantly learning and then you can take those lessons and apply them across all the companies. So instead of being, all of my experiences what it's like to work at Pebble, I actually now have the experience of having worked with, I think, eight or nine different startups over the past few years with a detour to be a business executive at Google in between. And so, I just love it. It's fun and the variety is there and I just really enjoy it quite a bit. I mean, you're almost like a walking AI machine because you have all this data in your head about all these different companies and I'm guessing some things are starting to come up that you say, "Yeah. Well, I've seen something similar a few years ago at this company." And that just transcends every experience that somebody can get in university or reading in a textbook because you actually lived through crises. You've lived through successes. And you've seen all the different complexities of these problems. I mean, you hear investors talk about pattern recognition. And it's the same thing. And it's funny because one of the things that you constantly hear about in the Valley is sometimes founders greatly discount the value of experience. They build a team and they're like, "Just give me somebody who is smart, enthusiastic, and they can be great." And sometimes that's right, but that pattern recognition and the wisdom of knowing when this kind of problem has come up. I've seen this movie 50 times before and I know that if you go this way or if you go that way, so, the smart route is go this way. Like you only get that from experience. And so what's fun now is to be able to operate with that experience and be able to apply that wisdom of experience. And it's really beneficial for companies and it's a thrill to kind of be presented with a problem and you're able to offer this perspective to the founders. Most of the time they're really really appreciative of that. And that's also the kind of thing that even the law firm lawyers I think struggle with because they're much more doctrinal and they're still in the business of identifying risk 'cause no law firm ever wants to be in a position where something bad happens at a company. And you go back to the law firm and say, "You didn't tell me about this. You didn't warn me about that." So, they're really in the business of warning and risk mitigation whereas I'm more in the business of saying, "How do I move the company forward but also navigate around or through some of these legal issues" I love it. Okay. So, Jeff, expect a call from me hopefully in less than a few years for my startup. But before that, I need three words that best describe you. All right. I'm gonna go with optimistic. All right. Determined. A lawyer saying optimistic. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Determined. And I think the third one would be evolving. I love it. I love it very much. And Jeff, I'm really glad to be learning all this from you. And we're both involved with J-Ventures and I just love how I get to be exposed to all these incredible people like yourself. So, thank you for everything that you're teaching me and I look forward to continue collaborating in the fund. And I look forward to working together in the future. That'd be great. Thanks a lot. This was a lot of fun. Thank you. Take care. Bye bye.
