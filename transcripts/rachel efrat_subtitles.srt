1
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,840
Rachel Efrat, thank you

2
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,600
for being on my show.

3
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
How are you?

4
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,280
Good. Thank you for having me.

5
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,760
It's a pleasure to be here.

6
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,120
Good morning to you. Good night to me.

7
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,760
You're calling from Ra'anana, right?

8
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,160
Yes. Yes.

9
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,760
Wonderful.

10
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,720
Okay. Rachel, I know nothing

11
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,760
about what are we going to talk about,

12
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,400
which is most exciting for me.

13
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,600
Because at this point, after about

14
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,000
a hundred and something episodes,

15
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,440
it's really exciting when I get to talk

16
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,680
to somebody and I have no idea

17
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,240
what they're going to tell me.

18
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,640
So, a little spoiler.

19
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,240
Today, you're a senior legal counsel

20
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,200
at Lightricks.

21
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,000
Previously, legal counsel at Gett.

22
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,840
But you've transition from actually,

23
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,120
traditional law and litigation,

24
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,360
into technology law.

25
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,880
So, Efrat, take me back,

26
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,000
Rachel. Sorry.

27
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,760
Take me back, all the way back

28
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,240
to when you were getting your law degree.

29
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,880
Do you know you're going to be in tech?

30
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,480
No, I had no idea.

31
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,160
I graduated law school.

32
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,720
And I immediately started

33
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,440
clerking for a judge.

34
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,760
I thought I was going to be a litigator.

35
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,280
In my mind, I always had this dream

36
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,440
of opening up my own private practice,

37
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,480
brick and mortar shop.

38
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,560
So, I clerked for a year. And then,

39
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,120
I worked at a plaintiff's law firm

40
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,880
representing people who had been

41
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,320
wrongfully terminated from their jobs.

42
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,400
Not necessarily tech. Right?

43
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,360
Unrelated. Completely unrelated.

44
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,160
Wow. So, Rachel, first of all,

45
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,360
litigation, paint me the picture.

46
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,560
What does that entail when you say

47
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,080
you were a litigator when you started out?

48
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,960
So, litigators are lawyers who go to court

49
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,480
and represent their clients

50
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,200
in legal disputes

51
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,240
that find their way to the courtroom.

52
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,360
So, as a clerk, you're the judge's

53
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,200
right hand man or woman.

54
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,960
And you prepare all of the motions,

55
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,560
do all of the legal research

56
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,720
behind the scenes, so that the Judge

57
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,480
can make the proper decision.

58
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,280
All the times that they say objection,

59
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,360
is that what it is?

60
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,520
Yes, I think you froze for a second.

61
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,160
Sorry, can you just repeat the last?

62
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,840
No. no. I was joking to ask you

63
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,000
if that when you say

64
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,240
to prepare all the motions,

65
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,160
that's about saying the objection.

66
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,360
Sure.

67
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,920
Like in the movies.

68
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,520
Okay. So, you go from litigation.

69
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,520
And then, where does the

70
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,680
your curb take you?

71
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,480
Sure. Sure.

72
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,480
So, what actually ended up happening,

73
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,600
I was working on a plaintiff's firm.

74
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,760
And then I end up moving to Israel.

75
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,880
I met my husband in New York,

76
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,840
and his work brought him back to Israel.

77
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,280
I came with, I thought

78
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,760
it would be a one year stint.

79
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,960
It's now been five years.

80
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,720
And I quickly realized

81
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,920
when I landed here,

82
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,600
that I wasn't going to do

83
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,160
litigation in Israel.

84
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,000
The whole Hebrew, I can get around.

85
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,120
But litigation in Hebrew

86
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,000
is a whole different ballgame.

87
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,760
Right.

88
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,880
So, I started realizing,

89
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,720
Okay. What are my opportunities here?

90
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,400
And a lot of the opportunities,

91
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,800
and you have to reinvent yourself,

92
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,760
which is a challenge.

93
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,360
Like taking a step back to move forwards.

94
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,880
Most of the opportunities

95
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,760
for English speaking American lawyers

96
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,360
are in tech or in the commercial space.

97
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,840
So, I got a job working

98
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,720
at a boutique law firm.

99
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,920
I'm representing lots of startups.

100
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,600
This was my first entry

101
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,800
into transactional work.

102
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,760
Because before, I had been working on,

103
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,360
writing motions, going to court,

104
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,120
depositions.

105
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,280
There's a lot of different things

106
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,160
you can do in the law.

107
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,640
I've been fortunate

108
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,520
to enjoy everything that I've done.

109
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,000
And I worked there for about two years.

110
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,600
And then, I just,

111
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,040
I wanted to move in-house.

112
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,280
It was something I thought would be fun.

113
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,960
You get to actually,

114
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,880
instead of representing lots of clients,

115
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,640
you have one client.

116
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,960
You get to know your client really well.

117
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,280
So, I actually, my boss at Gett,

118
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,040
I e-mails her.

119
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,080
I saw that they were looking

120
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,840
for legal counsel and I e-mais her.

121
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,280
And I told her,

122
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,280
"I would really love to work for you."

123
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,000
And one thing led to another.

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,920
I ended up getting hired there.

125
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,040
I worked there for three years.

126
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,340
Rachel, what does that mean

127
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,520
the legal counsel

128
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,120
within a company like the Gett?

129
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,320
And whoever doesn't know, Gett is already,

130
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,640
I believe, the unicorn, right?

131
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,640
An Israel Unicorn,

132
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,760
where they provide ride-sharing services

133
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,160
similar to Uber and Lyft across the world.

134
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,760
Gett is focused on different areas,

135
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,200
particularly also Israel.

136
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,640
But what does that mean

137
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,920
to have a legal counsel

138
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,600
within an organization like Gett?

139
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,080
Sure. So, basically what it means

140
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,840
as a legal counsel,

141
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,240
you are the in-house lawyer

142
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,480
for the company.

143
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,640
So, the company is your client.

144
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,880
In essence, you have one client

145
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,280
and that's the company.

146
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,640
In practice, you still have

147
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,160
hundreds of clients.

148
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,880
Because when you're

149
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,600
in a high growth startup,

150
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,760
the legal teams

151
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,400
tend to be relatively small.

152
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,520
So, you have your hands

153
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,360
in a lot of different places.

154
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,400
So, when you say you have

155
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,720
a hundred clients, you mean a hundred

156
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,120
different stakeholders within the company

157
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,920
who who need your assistance

158
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,200
under the Gett name.

159
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,280
But you're considering them

160
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,280
as a hundred different clients

161
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,320
because they have different needs.

162
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,520
Exactly. Exactly.

163
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,280
So, you may find yourself

164
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,000
working with the product team

165
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,040
on issues of regulatory compliance.

166
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,280
Like in a ride sharing company,

167
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,400
there's tons of regulatory needs

168
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,080
to make sure that your pricing

169
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,640
is in compliance.

170
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
You may find yourselves

171
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,920
working with developers

172
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,760
on the data team,

173
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,600
because GDPR, CCPA,

174
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,400
all of a sudden you need to get

175
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,040
all your data in place.

176
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,680
Working with the finance team

177
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,520
on inter-company agreements,

178
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,280
investment rounds,

179
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,160
supporting due diligence,

180
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,440
your Biz Dev team

181
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,680
on partnership agreements.

182
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,840
So, every single stakeholder

183
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,080
has totally different needs.

184
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,640
Actually, this is one of the things

185
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,440
I love about it,

186
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,600
because it really never gets boring.

187
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,000
You have insights into

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,800
so many different areas of the company.

189
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,560
So many different people.

190
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,360
And you get to see everyone's

191
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,360
different perspective.

192
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,920
But your job as legal counsel

193
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,880
is essentially, to advise the company.

194
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,280
To support them and to manage

195
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,280
their legal risk and exposure.

196
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,960
So, are you the pessimist in the group?

197
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,680
In the startup?

198
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,720
No, because I'm serious.

199
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,760
Because I'm thinking

200
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,800
of a startup organization.

201
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,920
Everybody's so excited about it.

202
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,240
It's like,

203
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,400
Yeah, move fast and break things.

204
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,800
And all of a sudden,

205
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,840
when I think of legal

206
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,120
in this context of a startup,

207
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,680
I think you're the downer.

208
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,520
The person who has to say, "No".

209
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,240
So, I wouldn't call it the pessimist,

210
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,600
but we're not always

211
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,960
the most popular person in the room.

212
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,560
Right.

213
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,440
So, there is a level of

214
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,800
having to be comfortable,

215
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,640
being uncomfortable.

216
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,800
Especially when you work in Israel

217
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,080
where conflict is just part of the game.

218
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,560
And people always just are so up front.

219
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,120
So, you just have to be very clear.

220
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,880
Know your boundaries.

221
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,480
I like to think that we're not the people

222
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,520
who are saying no.

223
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,320
That we're just coming

224
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,200
from a different perspective.

225
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,320
People are just, don't think the same way

226
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,800
that we think.

227
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,560
While we're also closing deals,

228
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,360
a lot of the time,

229
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,680
we're also the same people

230
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,080
who have to pick up the pieces

231
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,200
when a deal goes sour

232
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,000
or when litigation ensues.

233
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,520
Or unfortunately, sometimes,

234
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,560
you go through a bankruptcy event

235
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,360
and your legal counsel

236
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,440
will be involved in that.

237
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,040
So, we've just,

238
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,040
we have a different perspective.

239
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,960
But I like to think of it

240
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,120
as Problem-Solving.

241
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,600
And that, we look for creative solutions.

242
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,360
I love it. Okay.

243
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,720
So, I have so many questions

244
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,680
already lined up in my head.

245
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,720
But first one, at what point does a startup

246
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,520
need a legal counsel in-house?

247
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,720
Because most startups,

248
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,840
when I incorporated my company

249
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,720
in high school with my good friend Drew,

250
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,240
we went into Cooley and they did pro bono.

251
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,680
They incorporated for us.

252
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,000
At what point do we say,

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,200
Okay. Now we're big enough

254
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,800
and we're ready to have somebody

255
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,920
in-house to work full time with us?

256
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,840
I think from what I've seen, generally,

257
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,720
I don't know if that the CEO says,

258
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,320
Oh, I now I want a lawyer in-house.

259
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,640
But usually the board requires that

260
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,960
as a company matures,

261
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
after they've reached

262
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,200
a certain level of investment,

263
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,480
and things like compliance

264
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,680
become more important.

265
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,840
If you're starting to think down the road

266
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,760
about an exit event,

267
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,560
and you really need to have

268
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,240
all your docs in order, obviously you need

269
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,760
the CFO and the CFO comes, I think,

270
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,840
before the legal counsel.

271
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,920
And that's when it starts

272
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
to get more pressing.

273
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,840
Okay. Okay, that's fascinating.

274
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,640
And then, tell me a little bit about

275
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,560
the inside the organization

276
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,200
as you're sitting there.

277
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,880
A lot of the times you get to work

278
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,120
with the different stakeholders

279
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,640
in the organization,

280
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,680
whether it's at Gett or at Lightricks.

281
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,720
I'm assuming that a lot of the times,

282
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,520
the rationale that you bring to the table

283
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,800
in your decision making or your processes,

284
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,160
they're not always understood

285
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,720
by your colleagues, right?

286
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,080
And you don't necessarily

287
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,840
always have the time to go and explain

288
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,000
why you need everything

289
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,240
the way that you need it.

290
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,840
Do you find that

291
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,400
there's a lot of tension with that,

292
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,480
or, do people give you the respect of,

293
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,560
Okay. You know, what you're doing,

294
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,440
we're going to trust you?

295
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,800
I think, it's a work in progress.

296
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,720
I don't think you can expect anyone

297
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,440
to just listen to you because I said so.

298
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,080
So, everyone who you're working with,

299
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,640
it's a relationship.

300
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,600
So, that's another thing

301
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,760
I really like about the job.

302
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,920
That you have to be a people person.

303
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,480
So, it's relationships

304
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,600
that you develop over time.

305
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,200
You're working with a lot of different people,

306
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,800
but you're working with the same people

307
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,120
day in and day out.

308
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,000
So, my approach, and I'm sure,

309
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,280
you can speak with different lawyers.

310
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
I have different approaches,

311
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,760
as I try to explain to them

312
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,600
why I'm advising them in a certain way.

313
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,200
Sometimes, they really don't care

314
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,880
about the law.

315
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,240
They just want a yes or no answer.

316
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,040
Right.

317
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,280
Like, That's nice.

318
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,720
Just tell me if I can do it or not.

319
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,720
But it's also, so they can understand

320
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,880
the reasoning behind it.

321
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,600
And it's not going to be

322
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,800
the last question they have.

323
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,760
So, they can get a sense of the direction

324
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,840
of what's okay, what's not.

325
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,960
And it also helps them be prepared

326
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,720
for the next time.

327
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,320
So, they have it on their radar.

328
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,120
And they can actually reach out to me

329
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,560
if they think something is not kosher.

330
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,760
So, I think educating your teams,

331
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,320
training them,

332
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,520
it's helpful for everyone.

333
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,120
And, in the end of the day, yes,

334
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,680
I have an agenda as a legal counsel,

335
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,800
but my agenda is really

336
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,400
for the better of the company.

337
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm not just doing it because

338
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,160
Rachel feels like it.

339
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,920
So, it's really educating the team

340
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,840
so that they realize

341
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,320
that this is important for Lightricks.

342
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,120
This is important for the company.

343
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,440
Not just because my lawyer said so.

344
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,920
That makes perfect sense.

345
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,560
And I think that,

346
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,040
then you are part of the organization

347
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,200
or a part of the culture.

348
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,920
And then to see with such, a lot of,

349
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,280
it sounds to me that almost every aspect

350
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,640
of the startup scene has changed

351
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,360
dramatically over the past 10, 15 years.

352
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,040
Whether it's things transitioning

353
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,320
from top down decisions

354
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,640
to bottom up decisions, responsibilities,

355
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,920
different ways of going about

356
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,520
getting a startup off the ground.

357
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,120
Has the legal counsel arena

358
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,760
within a startup changed at all

359
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,680
over the past 10, 15 years?

360
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,560
Or, is it the same methodology,

361
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,320
same types of people?

362
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,360
That I can't really say.

363
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,280
Because I haven't been a legal counsel

364
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,160
in-house for 15 years.

365
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,400
From your experience. Yeah.

366
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,440
I would imagine so.

367
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,960
Just because the industry has changed.

368
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,880
Like the technology has changed.

369
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,760
So, the way that things work now,

370
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,320
things change so quickly

371
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,640
because technology is changing so quickly.

372
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,440
And because technology

373
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,600
is changing so quickly,

374
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
the regulations are also changing

375
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,080
a bit more quickly

376
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,040
than they used to as well.

377
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,320
So, the pace is just so fast.

378
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,640
Especially in a high tech company.

379
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,560
So, I think probably the people

380
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,840
who want to go in-house

381
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,360
and be an in-house lawyer

382
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,640
at a tech company particularly,

383
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,160
need to be ready to think quickly,

384
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,840
have super strong intuition.

385
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,800
Because you will be hit with issues

386
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,480
that you're not an expert in everything.

387
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,160
But you have to know still how to react

388
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,040
and when you need to seek guidance

389
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,000
from outside counsel who are experts.

390
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,720
100%. I mean, one of the things

391
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,520
that I was just thinking about

392
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,720
in terms of the legal world is that,

393
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,760
companies have become

394
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,960
so much more globalized

395
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,320
over the past decade.

396
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,600
I mean, before you had the legal counsel

397
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,280
that were experts in the jurisdiction,

398
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,240
let's look at Gett, for example.

399
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
Legal experts that are

400
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,240
concentrated in Israel,

401
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,360
and transportation laws, for example.

402
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,040
And all of a sudden you want to branch out

403
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,880
because that's what every

404
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,080
company is doing today.

405
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,760
And all of a sudden

406
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,520
you need to have expertise

407
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,880
in those different countries.

408
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,760
It's no longer the same expertise.

409
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,680
You need to expand your knowledge, right?

410
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,760
And not just within Gett,

411
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,840
but every company

412
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,680
that is selling globally.

413
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,360
And today,

414
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,760
almost every single company

415
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,240
is selling globally.

416
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,640
Yeah, it's a huge challenge.

417
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,440
Because everyone wants to be global.

418
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,760
That's how you make money, right?

419
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,280
You don't make money investing in Israel.

420
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,400
So, it's a challenge.

421
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,280
Because you find yourself in a situation,

422
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,960
and every industry is different.

423
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,760
Like ride sharing, for example.

424
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,240
You might have different taxi laws

425
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,840
in New York City

426
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,240
compared to upstate New York.

427
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,800
And you're operating in the same state.

428
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,840
Yet the taxi rules are different.

429
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,320
And the pricing is different.

430
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,640
And all of these laws

431
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,800
have to be reflected in your product.

432
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,040
And how the price appears to the end user.

433
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,840
So, and then even negotiating that

434
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,800
across different countries

435
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,960
in different languages,

436
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,320
different tax laws,

437
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,040
it's a lot of work.

438
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,840
Because you're actually seeking guidance

439
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,560
from experts all over the world

440
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,040
in all these different jurisdictions.

441
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,440
And you have to decide,

442
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,760
Okay. Are we going to have

443
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,680
bespoke product

444
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,440
for every single jurisdiction,

445
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,480
or,  do we make a global solution

446
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,800
that will work

447
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,120
for every single jurisdiction?

448
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,920
It's a challenge.

449
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,000
It's definitely a challenge.

450
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,800
But it's exciting.

451
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,480
And it gives you the opportunity

452
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,440
to work with people all over the world

453
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,320
who are experts in their field,

454
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,000
which is amazing.

455
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,800
I'm very curious.

456
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,240
How long of an on-boarding process

457
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,920
is it for a legal counsel?

458
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,640
Traditionally, when you enter

459
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,920
a tech company,

460
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,960
I'm making a comparison as an engineer,

461
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,800
and having just, for example,

462
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,080
onboarded into Hippo Insurance,

463
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,240
basically within one or two days

464
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,320
they expect you to already be

465
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,080
pushing code to production.

466
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,000
I imagine it would be a little bit longer

467
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,520
for a legal counsel that has

468
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,520
to really get acquainted

469
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,800
with the company policies and legal, right?

470
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,640
It should.

471
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,840
But you're still hit the ground running.

472
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,280
Because usually, by the time you arrive,

473
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,320
they really need you.

474
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,360
So,  yes. You do take some time

475
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,680
to read your terms and conditions,

476
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,240
your privacy policy, meet with

477
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,760
all the the relevant stakeholders

478
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,800
to understand the different products

479
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,520
and road map.

480
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,000
But people are always pulling you

481
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,920
from the sides and like,

482
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,120
Hey, can you review this?

483
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,320
Hey, I have a question on this.

484
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,920
And you quickly understand,

485
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,600
Okay. These are going to be

486
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,200
the main issues of law

487
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,760
that I'm going to have

488
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,040
to become an expert in.

489
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,440
Because every industry is very different.

490
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,560
Right. And before I asked about,

491
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,520
whether your colleagues

492
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,440
and other employees in the organization

493
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,920
understand your decision making processes.

494
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,640
And, I'm now I'm shifting the question

495
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,760
more towards the leadership.

496
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,760
Does the leadership necessarily understand

497
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,200
all the legal intricacies

498
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,700
behind the decision making?

499
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,440
I'm thinking about, the CEO,

500
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,880
senior vice president positions,

501
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,000
these are people who are making

502
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,640
critical decisions then and there.

503
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,160
And I imagine that they're also the ones

504
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,560
who are having the most interaction

505
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,600
with the legal counsel

506
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,920
as they are considering their options.

507
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,440
How much do they generally understand

508
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,080
the legal scene

509
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,000
behind these different decisions?

510
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,120
I think that they need to understand it.

511
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,040
Because ultimately,

512
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,080
these are also the people

513
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,400
who are responsible for the company.

514
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,440
Directors and on officers.

515
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,440
So, even more so, it's important

516
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,520
for them to understand,

517
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,240
because if they accept risk,

518
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,560
they're the only ones in the company

519
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,840
who actually have the authority

520
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,960
to accept risk.

521
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,160
So, it's your job to explain the risks.

522
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,160
100% The dissidents, in my mind,

523
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
is that at the end,

524
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,000
you think of a startup

525
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,160
and a fast growing company, you think,

526
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,200
Okay. You want to move quickly,

527
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,680
you want to make decisions quickly,

528
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,680
and you also delegate a lot of tasks

529
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,640
to other decision making authorities

530
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,560
and you trust them.

531
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,280
And one of these key figures,

532
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,560
I'm guessing is the legal counsel.

533
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,440
But at the end, this is one area

534
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,520
in which it's imperative

535
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,600
that the decision makers

536
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,840
don't just rely on your statements,

537
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,720
but they have to be able

538
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,200
to defend them later on.

539
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,320
Especially since we're talking

540
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,160
about legal things here.

541
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,000
Rachel, this has been so so good to have.

542
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,720
Two more questions.

543
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,200
But first, before we end,

544
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,680
I want to ask you for three words

545
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,400
that you would best use

546
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,560
to describe yourself.

547
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,640
Okay. So, I guess I'll choose words

548
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,320
that are applied both personally

549
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,970
and professionally.

550
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,880
Reliable. Hardworking.

551
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,080
And, up for a challenge.

552
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,200
Reliable. Hardworking.

553
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,880
And, up for a challenge.

554
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,480
I love it.

555
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,840
And right before we leave,

556
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,880
Rachel, talk to me a little bit about

557
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,000
why you're so passionate

558
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,400
about what you're doing?

559
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,320
Coming in very fresh

560
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,880
into this world of legal counsel,

561
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,960
Why now? Why in tech?

562
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,160
You could have continued doing

563
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,440
what you were doing before.

564
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,640
What excites you about the work

565
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,360
that you're doing today?

566
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,080
I think it's a combination

567
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,000
of three facets.

568
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,640
I like working with people.

569
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
I like problem solving.

570
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,480
And especially in tech, it's never boring.

571
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,120
You get exposure to

572
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,720
the most interesting topics,

573
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,200
whether it's a machine learning,

574
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,120
privacy issues.

575
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,320
So, there's a cerebral part to it as well.

576
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,120
I love it.

577
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,880
Rachel, thank you very very much.

578
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,920
Toda raba.

579
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,160
Have a fantastic day.

580
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,400
And stay safe and stay healthy.

581
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,360
This is great.

582
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,520
You too. Thank you so much.

583
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,040
Bye. Take care.

584
00:24:18,040 --> 00:25:08,160
Take care.
