1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,199
For those people

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,799
who are just out of college

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,399
that it's okay to not know.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,479
Instead of trying

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,839
to have a clear path and destination

6
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,199
to where you want to be

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,759
as a mid to late career,

8
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,000
think about what you value.

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,439
David Weekly, thank you so much

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,319
for being on my show.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,199
It's been seven years

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,439
since we last seen each other,

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,999
but I'm so excited

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,999
to reclaim all of that inspiration

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,999
that I had back then.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,759
Thank you for joining me.

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,279
Pleased to be here.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,519
Thank you.

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,779
I can't even imagine how busy

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,479
your schedule is,

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,799
given everything that you do.

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,679
And first of all,

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,759
I want to start by thanking you

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,159
for coming seven years ago

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,039
to one of the hackathons

26
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,759
that I organized

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,359
back in Redwood City,

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,000
Hacking Generation Y.

29
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:07,679
You gave such a wonderful keynote

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,319
that day. I keep visiting

31
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,439
and people have been talking about it

32
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,279
ever since then.

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,999
So, really thank you for talking

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,799
And it was about doing.

35
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,959
It was about exploring

36
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,759
and having passion

37
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,079
and having curiosity

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,999
and I'm excited to having

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,439
to let that shine through here.

40
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,559
I'm going to do a really brief intro about you,

41
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,439
even though it's not going to do justice.

42
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,319
But just bear with me

43
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,039
because I have to get

44
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,799
the context of who you are.

45
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,199
Founded PBworks,

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,479
then managing founder of Mexican.vc.

47
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,639
And I believe you returned 11x

48
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,319
on the cash-on-cash,

49
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,719
the most profitable Mexican VC

50
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,679
in history, I believe.

51
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,999
Entrepreneur in residence,

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,072
Trinity Ventures.

53
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,879
Founded Gaston Labs.

54
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,119
Product Manager at Facebook,

55
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,919
after the acquisition

56
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,839
of another startup of yours, Oha.na.

57
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,479
Head of products of various things

58
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,679
at Google, and most recently,

59
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,079
the founder and CEO of Medcorder

60
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,359
which I want to spend

61
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,479
a chunk of time talking about

62
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,479
because I'm just so excited

63
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,762
about your mission.

64
00:02:02,962 --> 00:02:03,639
Hacker Dojo,

65
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,159
which I didn't even mention.

66
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,279
Way too much to talk about.

67
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,479
David, who are you?

68
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,039
How do you get

69
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,040
to do so many things?

70
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,680
What is this?

71
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,959
So, I'm a nerd who loves people.

72
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,239
And I think a lot of what I build

73
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,359
just comes out of that.

74
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,759
I like to build things.

75
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,279
I like to learn new technical systems.

76
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,199
I'm a product guy,

77
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,959
so I like building solutions to problems

78
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,199
and conspiring with other people

79
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,399
to go and build those things.

80
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,119
And then finally,

81
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,559
I just, I like bringing people together.

82
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,719
I like connecting people.

83
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,799
I get a lot of personal satisfaction

84
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,839
out of doing that.

85
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,799
And so, if you look at the mishmash

86
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,480
of stuff that I've done,

87
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:43,879
it probably doesn't seem

88
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,439
like it is constructed

89
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,040
in a coherent narrative arc.

90
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,280
Right?

91
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:49,879
And that's because it wasn't candidly,

92
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,640
you know, I think a lot

93
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,480
of people starting

94
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,360
their careers tried to ask the question

95
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,560
like, where do I want to be

96
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,120
in 5, 10, 20 years.

97
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,640
Like, what is my career

98
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,440
going to look like.

99
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,400
And it's a tremendously

100
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,280
intimidating question, right?

101
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,160
Because you look at people

102
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,080
who are very, very successful,

103
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,800
and I think a lot of people conclude

104
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,560
these people must have

105
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,640
just upon graduating college,

106
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,080
sat down, thought really hard

107
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,320
and come up with this beautiful story arc

108
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,080
of where their life was going to go

109
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,240
and how they were going

110
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,760
to get there.

111
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,600
And, oh, my gosh,

112
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,200
I don't have that written down

113
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,480
and or I do.

114
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,680
And it's not credible.

115
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:25,960
Right?

116
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,360
And what am I going to do?

117
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,760
I must be a failure because

118
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,160
that is the path to success,

119
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,280
having this clear

120
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,040
multi decade narrative arc

121
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,920
of what your career is going to be.

122
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,840
And if you actually get to know a number

123
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,840
of very famous and successful people,

124
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,040
generally it doesn't work like that.

125
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,400
Right?

126
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,960
That they're likely hard working,

127
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,480
they're likely intelligent,

128
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,560
they're likely charismatic

129
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,040
or have figured out how to be.

130
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,720
That's actually something

131
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,560
you can learn to be.

132
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,360
And then a number

133
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,560
of lucky opportunities

134
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,480
came about

135
00:03:58,481 --> 00:03:59,079
and they were able

136
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,520
to take advantage of those

137
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,560
because they were clever

138
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,800
and hardworking and well-connected

139
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:05,919
and liked people

140
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,919
and could motivate people

141
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,759
to go and work on missions.

142
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:08,959
Right?

143
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,479
And so, life often

144
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,239
is much more random

145
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,839
that we want to give it

146
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,399
an account for.

147
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,319
So, I would say for those people

148
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,879
who are just out of college

149
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,479
that it's okay to not know.

150
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,559
Instead of trying

151
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,959
to have a clear path and destination

152
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,919
to where you want to be

153
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,839
as a mid to late career,

154
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,839
think about what you value.

155
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,639
If you enjoy learning, great.

156
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,399
You should make sure

157
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,839
that any job that you take,

158
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,719
you're going to be learning something.

159
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,040
If you enjoy having broader impact

160
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,080
and looking at numbers

161
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,800
and metrics, great.

162
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,880
You don't need to be embarrassed

163
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,680
about that.

164
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,400
Go run with that.

165
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,280
If you enjoy building something

166
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,520
brand new, then great.

167
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:50,919
You don't need

168
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,600
to be embarrassed about that.

169
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,280
One other thing

170
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,320
that often comes up

171
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:56,279
in people's career trajectories is

172
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,400
that they find themselves embarrassed

173
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,440
about things that are

174
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,000
off that narrative arc.

175
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,720
Maybe you really like

176
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,880
being a scuba diver,

177
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,440
or you like horses,

178
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:07,879
or you like spending time

179
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,839
learning how to go

180
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,759
and do ballroom dancing. Right?

181
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,159
And these things don't feel like

182
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,959
they're working toward

183
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,039
a successful career end point.

184
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,599
They are outside

185
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,599
of this narrative arc,

186
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,519
what do I do.

187
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,839
And what's funny is

188
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,559
often times these things

189
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,519
that make you weird,

190
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,439
your unique

191
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,559
particular collection of interests

192
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,199
and experiences that nobody else has

193
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,599
ends up making you valuable.

194
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,720
Right?

195
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,400
So, what we want increasingly

196
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,360
is people who are non fungible,

197
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,800
who can't just be swapped out

198
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:41,159
like cogs in the wheel.

199
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,239
But whose weird experiences

200
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,120
give them unique insights

201
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,840
and ways of tackling

202
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,560
the problems in front of them

203
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,280
that only they could have had

204
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,920
because only they

205
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,400
are coming at the problem

206
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,040
with those set of,

207
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,000
of weird backgrounds and experiences.

208
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,520
So, I think going back

209
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,640
to my own trajectory and arc,

210
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:03,039
a lot of it was like that.

211
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,439
It was trying to optimize for learning,

212
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,680
trying to optimize for impact,

213
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,520
trying to not be in a rut

214
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:11,319
or get bored

215
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,519
or not developing myself further,

216
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,119
always hungry to see

217
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,679
what problems can I solve

218
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,879
that need to be solved

219
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,960
out there in the world,

220
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,319
and how can I do that

221
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,959
in an enjoyable way.

222
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,799
Right?

223
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:23,840
Well, David,

224
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,839
how do you optimize for learning

225
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,599
in a world that is such

226
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,159
it's one convoluted race towards the top,

227
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,449
towards the greatest funding,

228
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:36,479
towards the greatest start,

229
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,959
of the greatest success?

230
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,400
I'm walking the streets of Palo Alto.

231
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm studying with incredible people.

232
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:43,959
I've served in the Israeli military

233
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,199
with some incredible people.

234
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,160
And it doesn't feel

235
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,320
that always optimized

236
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:49,959
for learning is something

237
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,159
that one can afford.

238
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,320
Right?

239
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,200
Because we have to move so quickly.

240
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,280
How do you optimize for learning?

241
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,760
How can you possibly succeed

242
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,680
if you're not continuously learning.

243
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,880
Right?

244
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,480
It's that, the endpoint is not defined.

245
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,000
The pie is not fixed.

246
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,400
This is not a race where where

247
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:09,879
the rules are prescribed.

248
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,159
And it's clear how to succeed.

249
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,679
It's obvious how to build

250
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,399
a billion dollar company,

251
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,519
and you just need to sit down

252
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,999
and do the work. Right?

253
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,440
Real life isn't like that.

254
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,200
The new billion dollar opportunities

255
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:24,319
by definition,

256
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,920
haven't been sussed out,

257
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:26,959
haven't been fleshed out.

258
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,919
They're going to require

259
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,039
thinking about things

260
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,520
in a new way

261
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,240
and doing things in a new way.

262
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:32,759
You want to be cognizant

263
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,160
of approaches and methodologies

264
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,040
that are generally shown

265
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,400
to be successful or not successful.

266
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:39,599
So, you want to learn from

267
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,080
your own failures

268
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,040
as well as the failures

269
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,920
of those around you

270
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,759
in terms of what structurally works and not.

271
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,000
And I'm not saying ignore everything.

272
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,800
But I am saying that

273
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,200
that process of continually learning

274
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,280
is a critical one

275
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,920
for modern employment.

276
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,600
So, you take a look at

277
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,400
technical product management, right?

278
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:00,359
So, anyone is a PM.

279
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,160
Google and pretty much

280
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,360
anyone is a PM at Facebook.

281
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,760
And they need to not only have

282
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,400
their fingers on the pulse

283
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,600
of what are real unsolved problems

284
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,320
that are out there

285
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,400
in the real world.

286
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:11,679
But then, on the other hand,

287
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,199
they're trying to match those

288
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,199
to what is the state

289
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,039
of the art and technology.

290
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,319
What can you grab off the shelf

291
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,559
and what can I

292
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,600
not yet grab off the shelf,

293
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,320
but I have enough technical depth

294
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,080
to know is possible and attainable.

295
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,280
It is not just magic

296
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,520
sprinkle fairy dust. Right?

297
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,520
And you've got enough credibility

298
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,930
to go and map that out to say,

299
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,480
I'm going to take these four pieces,

300
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,880
three of which have been known

301
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,399
and well-defined for decades,

302
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,279
two of which only became possible

303
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,639
in the last couple of months.

304
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,399
And then there's this

305
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,519
one extra part over here

306
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,999
that doesn't yet exist.

307
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,279
But I'm confident that

308
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,719
with this team of engineers,

309
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,199
I can be able to invent on it.

310
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,639
And here's the reason why

311
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,439
I think it's tractable

312
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,500
and derisible from tech.

313
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:54,439
So, I'm going to put

314
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,519
these things together.

315
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,199
And I'm going to solve

316
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,879
the problem over here

317
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,759
that is otherwise unsolved.

318
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,359
And I'm going to be

319
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,199
the first person to go

320
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,199
and have this new way

321
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,079
of looking at the problem,

322
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,840
this new solution for this problem.

323
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,160
And if you are not keeping up

324
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,600
on not only what

325
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,920
was commercially viable

326
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,120
because it was out there,

327
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,160
but also as academia advances

328
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,320
in understanding what soon

329
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,920
will be possible

330
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,760
and what commercial impacts

331
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:19,719
that is going to have,

332
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,919
if you're not looking

333
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,359
into the crystal ball there,

334
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,079
you're going to miss out

335
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,479
on opportunities,

336
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,439
things that were impossible

337
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,039
five years ago.

338
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,079
You'll miss as possible solutions

339
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,359
because they're possible

340
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,759
when weren't then.

341
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,120
And so, you won't think to build

342
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,280
the product in that way,

343
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:36,759
leveraging those technologies.

344
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,960
So, you'll miss out.

345
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,840
So, there's a lot of different ways

346
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,280
in which in almost

347
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,480
any part of the stack,

348
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,800
whether you're a designer

349
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,640
or a marketer

350
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,600
or an engineer

351
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,160
or a product manager

352
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,920
or a CEO,

353
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,960
almost any role

354
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,440
in the company you can think of.

355
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,960
Even if you're doing QA testing,

356
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
the state of the art

357
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,120
is continuing to evolve pretty quickly.

358
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,160
And what that does

359
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,760
is it gives super powers

360
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,280
to the people who are able

361
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,680
to keep up with it.

362
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,520
You can see in this era,

363
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,920
small teams

364
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,280
have ridiculously sized impact

365
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,320
a far more than

366
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,880
they've been able to

367
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,840
pretty much any other point

368
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,640
in human history.

369
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,200
A team of a dozen

370
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,280
or so people can build

371
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,360
a product that a billion people use.

372
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,560
Right?

373
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,720
That's never believable.

374
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,880
It's unbelievable.

375
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:24,039
So, you think about

376
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,080
what do those

377
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,320
couple dozen people need to know?

378
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,560
They all need to know

379
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,000
how to operate at scale.

380
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,040
They need to be able

381
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,360
to harness the tools,

382
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,040
the methodologies,

383
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,879
the frameworks that are out there

384
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,200
to operate at scale

385
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,360
and to be effective

386
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,120
and then to keep up with that.

387
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,360
Now, I want to nuance that a little bit

388
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,160
with there's so much that's new,

389
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,600
always coming out

390
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,760
that trying to be completely on top

391
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,840
of absolutely every new development

392
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,440
in every field

393
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,400
is just not possible

394
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,720
for any human being.

395
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,960
Particularly, if you're also, say,

396
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,040
trying to build a company

397
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,120
at the same time.

398
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,680
Right?

399
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,360
So, you'll have to acknowledge that

400
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,440
even when you're trying

401
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,840
to optimize for learning

402
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,040
and keep up on things,

403
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,440
you're going to miss a lot.

404
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,480
A. That's okay.

405
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,760
No need to beat yourself up.

406
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,480
There really are only 24 hours

407
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,000
in the day for absolutely everybody.

408
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,800
And B, you can also figure out how

409
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,360
to leverage your networks

410
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
to help you proxy for other areas.

411
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:19,319
So, if you're focused

412
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,319
in some area over here,

413
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,800
then as long as

414
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,320
you know who to talk to

415
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,760
about some of these other areas

416
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,280
so they can sort of keep their ear

417
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,680
to the ground for you,

418
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,440
then you can have sort

419
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,000
of disproportionate impact there.

420
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,800
Because, I don't need to keep up

421
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
on the state of the art

422
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,280
and say biotech,

423
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,480
that's way outside of stuff

424
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,800
I know a lot about.

425
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,640
And it's okay for me

426
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,800
to not know a lot about that.

427
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:44,359
But it kind of interesting conversations

428
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,320
with friends of mine

429
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,040
who are deep in that.

430
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,720
And so, I can go and ping them

431
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,000
when I have questions there.

432
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,680
So, you don't have to do it

433
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,560
all yourself either.

434
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,680
I think that's just fascinating.

435
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:54,479
David, if I look at your trajectory

436
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,079
in the different things

437
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,680
that you've done,

438
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,920
the incredible things you've done,

439
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,400
it's a really remarkable balance

440
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,920
between continuing your own journey

441
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,960
as an entrepreneur,

442
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:04,879
as an investor,

443
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,319
as a thinker,

444
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,279
but also giving back to the community.

445
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,119
So many of your projects are involving

446
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,600
the community helping others get started,

447
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,360
and helping others pursue their passions.

448
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,720
What is that about?

449
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,880
Where does all this motivation

450
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,320
and passion for the community building

451
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,040
coming along with your trajectory

452
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,560
of being a great engineer,

453
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,200
great entrepreneur?

454
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,880
I think the short answer is

455
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,320
because it's fun.

456
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,120
It's fun to throw parties,

457
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,480
it's fun to introduce

458
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,560
people to each other

459
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,000
that end up hitting it off

460
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,720
and investing in each other,

461
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,920
working together to found a company.

462
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,760
It's fun to meet with founders

463
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,120
who are filled with passion

464
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,800
for going and bringing new products

465
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,680
into the world

466
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:44,439
and conspiring with them

467
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,400
around ways to help

468
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,960
their dreams come true.

469
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,240
It's an enjoyable thing to do.

470
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:49,439
So, even just from a

471
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,480
purely selfish perspective,

472
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,880
I help the community

473
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,000
because I enjoy doing that.

474
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:57,519
I think some of it also

475
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,720
is a critical cultural component

476
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,560
of Silicon Valley.

477
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,680
I think there's, Silicon Valley

478
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,520
is not a perfect place,

479
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,160
there's a lot of things

480
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,840
to hate about it.

481
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,240
And there's certainly been lots

482
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,040
of discourse around people

483
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,840
leaving San Francisco in particular,

484
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,520
which is one part of the Bay Area.

485
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm going to think

486
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,320
that is valid and pointed.

487
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,720
But I think there are some aspects

488
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,320
of Silicon Valley culture

489
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,120
that are really positive

490
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,480
and are also "stealable".

491
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,280
You can incorporate these aspects

492
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,880
into other cultures

493
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,840
and other geographies as well.

494
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
And I think one of the ones that I love

495
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,200
is an overall pay it forward mentality.

496
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,560
You know, I think

497
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,200
most other business ecosystems

498
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:35,479
operate on a very mercenary

499
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,399
kind of a basis.

500
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,959
So, you only take a meeting

501
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,920
with somebody if it's clear

502
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,760
what they're going to be

503
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,120
able to do for you

504
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,400
and what you're

505
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
going to be able to do for them.

506
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,520
Right?

507
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,800
So, there's sort of a tit for tat.

508
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,040
It's a match and peers.

509
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,640
And it means that

510
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:49,959
it can be very difficult

511
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,319
to meet with people

512
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,599
who are powerful,

513
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,960
people who are wealthy.

514
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Right?

515
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,640
And it's frankly,

516
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,560
it's a little bit more

517
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,120
of a fixed pie mentality.

518
00:13:58,121 --> 00:13:58,359
Right?

519
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,160
So, they reach out the rich,

520
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,720
the folks who are really trying

521
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
to help folks who are early,

522
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:04,439
but it's always

523
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,559
in exchange for something.

524
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,279
And that sort of market making

525
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,040
where you're trying

526
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,440
to match up very evenly

527
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,760
to people who can get

528
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,040
the equal amount of value

529
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,920
for each other,

530
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,960
just doing the math says

531
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,840
there's going to be fewer

532
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,120
of those pairings.

533
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,080
Right?

534
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,400
But if you come at an ecosystem

535
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,280
with a pay it forward mentality,

536
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,360
there's an enormous explosion

537
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,280
in the number of positive connections

538
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,760
that can happen.

539
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,080
And what capitalism will tell you

540
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,800
is that any time there's

541
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,720
there's an exchange,

542
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:35,079
value is created.

543
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,640
Right?

544
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,920
And so by encouraging there

545
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,800
to be more of those exchanges,

546
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:40,159
by not looking

547
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,240
at the mercenary equal value exchange,

548
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,160
tit for tat,

549
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,440
you end up growing the value

550
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,560
of the ecosystem much more dramatically.

551
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,040
And we actually, you mentioned

552
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,440
you're in Tel Aviv right now.

553
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,720
We actually saw this happen

554
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,640
in the Israeli startup ecosystem,

555
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,520
starting with the ICQ acquisition.

556
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,880
Because after ICQ,

557
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,560
the founders turned around

558
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:00,559
and not only invested their capital,

559
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,040
but also their knowhow

560
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,160
in helping build up

561
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,080
the Israeli startup ecosystem.

562
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,960
And that really,

563
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,720
I would say,

564
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,120
just as an outside observer,

565
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,680
is where I really saw

566
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,439
things start to explode.

567
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,519
And so, the fact that

568
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,719
Israel could apply

569
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,359
the Silicon Valley style mentality

570
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,999
of reinvest your time

571
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,119
and your money in ecosystem,

572
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,719
we really saw things blow up.

573
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,079
So, I'm sure in Silicon Valley,

574
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,480
you take a look

575
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,920
at the most experienced

576
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,840
venture capital firms

577
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,400
that are providing

578
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,800
the most disproportionate return,

579
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,800
what's true of the VCs there,

580
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,440
generally,

581
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,400
they're disproportionately

582
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,040
former operators themselves.

583
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,640
Right?

584
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,680
Because they love

585
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,120
helping entrepreneurs.

586
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,600
They can give actionable

587
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,800
advice and guidance

588
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,680
on what to do at difficult parts

589
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,640
in the startups journey.

590
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,040
And they've been there before,

591
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,680
which gives them credibility

592
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,400
with founders

593
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,160
for highly competitive deals.

594
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,920
Right?

595
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,240
You look at the

596
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,400
investment ecosystem

597
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
in most other parts of the planet,

598
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,320
the people making

599
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,640
the decisions about whether or not

600
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:57,359
to back an early stage company

601
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,560
have never done it themselves.

602
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,640
And they actually down on it.

603
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,320
Right?

604
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:05,079
You know, when they themselves,

605
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,640
in a number of different ecosystems,

606
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,720
inherited that money

607
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,240
from their father's corruption.

608
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,480
Right?

609
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,000
It's so,

610
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,160
they're very big on themselves

611
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,240
and they're very down

612
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,359
on the lowly entrepreneurs

613
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,079
who have to come crawling

614
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
on their knees like,

615
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,680
please give me your money

616
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,080
esteemed investor.

617
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,720
Right?

618
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,480
And really none of that kind

619
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,680
of mentality or structure,

620
00:16:28,681 --> 00:16:30,759
it's not present to nearly

621
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,959
the same extent, I would say,

622
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,560
here in Silicon Valley,

623
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,760
where it's sort of expected that

624
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:36,679
you're going to try your best

625
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,040
to go and build something.

626
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,240
If it's successful,

627
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,560
you're going to pay it back.

628
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,360
You know, whether that's

629
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,800
because you're going to be a VC

630
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,440
and help other companies succeed

631
00:16:44,441 --> 00:16:45,599
or you're going to advise

632
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,599
and mentor others,

633
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,680
or maybe you're just

634
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,840
going to tool in your garage

635
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,120
and build awesome opensource

636
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,880
that everyone can use.

637
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,280
But whatever it is

638
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,560
that you're going to go

639
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,600
and pay back into the ecosystem.

640
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,040
A lot of the billionaires that are here

641
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,600
became billionaires disproportionally

642
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,400
because other people went

643
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,839
and helped them with,

644
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:13,000
again, no expectation around return.

645
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,080
Right?

646
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,200
These were people who helped

647
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,119
just because it was fun

648
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,959
to help people who

649
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,039
were starting things,

650
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,200
were finding things

651
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:20,359
and great things come out of that.

652
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,880
Like Pinterest was actually started

653
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,120
at Hacker Dojo, right?

654
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,080
Really?

655
00:17:25,081 --> 00:17:26,399
Yeah, yeah.

656
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,800
What?

657
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,800
Lambda School as well,

658
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,480
started in Hacker Dojo.

659
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,800
Okay. So, give me two words

660
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,680
about Hacker Dojo

661
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,720
just for anybody who doesn't know.

662
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:35,960
Yeah.

663
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,000
So, unfortunately,

664
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,280
the facility is closed right now

665
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,400
during coronavirus.

666
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,240
But what it is,

667
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:42,439
it's a non-profit community center

668
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,559
for people go

669
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,400
and improve their technical skills.

670
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,960
So, this is helping people

671
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,720
who are just getting into tech

672
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,920
for the first time,

673
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,320
as well as helping people

674
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,320
who already maybe

675
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,399
have mastered some areas

676
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,960
of technology to come

677
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,480
and level up even more.

678
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:56,640
Right?

679
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:58,439
So, you can sort of think of it like

680
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,720
halfway between the incubator

681
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,120
and like an anarchist community college.

682
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,920
I love it.

683
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:04,279
Yeah.

684
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,079
So, it's just it's run

685
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,360
on a membership basis.

686
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,520
But when we're open,

687
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:10,959
we have ten times more people

688
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,839
than members come through

689
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,559
the front doors to go

690
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,319
and take classes

691
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,480
in machine learning,

692
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,199
Android programming,

693
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,239
and whatever else it is.

694
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,440
We've got all kinds of meet ups.

695
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:22,119
We've got a small

696
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,039
machine shop there,

697
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,079
so, you can go in

698
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,679
and build some physical things,

699
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,359
Sauter components, et cetera.

700
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,080
I love it.

701
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,800
And needless to say,

702
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:30,839
you're the chairman of Hacker Dojo.

703
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,280
But David, Medcorder.

704
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,016
I see a lot of

705
00:18:35,216 --> 00:18:36,880
early stage startups right now.

706
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,040
Very lucky to be part

707
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,560
of the great VC group in Silicon Valley.

708
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,960
I'm not that often

709
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,600
has invoked emotionally when I read

710
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:49,039
even three short snippets

711
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,519
about what a company does.

712
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,399
And I know that it also has

713
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,720
a personal story with you.

714
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:55,640
What is Medcorder?

715
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,000
So, Medcorder is a free application

716
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,560
for Apple and for Android

717
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,320
that helps patients record,

718
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,280
transcribe and discuss medical encounters

719
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,880
with family members.

720
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,280
So, this was built after

721
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,560
my dad got prostate cancer

722
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,480
and he was on the opposite coast

723
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,440
from me, a couple thousand miles away.

724
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,120
And we wanted to work together,

725
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,320
figure out what was going on,

726
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,920
what our options were, etc.

727
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,040
So, he would get permission

728
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,920
from his oncologist

729
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,280
to record the audio

730
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:27,119
of the console to email that

731
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,400
as an attachment to me,

732
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,160
I'd listen through the whole thing.

733
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,160
I'd write up a summary,

734
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:33,759
I'd link out any medical terms or drugs

735
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,160
I wasn't familiar with

736
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,520
and I'd email the family.

737
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,640
The workflow works great

738
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,920
for getting us on the same page

739
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,840
about what was going on.

740
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,720
But it was a lot of work on my part.

741
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,800
It became clear that most patients

742
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,760
and their families didn't have

743
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,160
a workflow like this.

744
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,760
So, I started looking into recordings.

745
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,400
I found more than 40 years

746
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,440
of clinical research showing that

747
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,920
it's a great idea

748
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,080
to send a patient home

749
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,640
with a recording of the console

750
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:57,959
to listen to it.

751
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,520
Their family will listen to it.

752
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,720
They'll have a much greater understanding

753
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,160
of what the doctor said.

754
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,479
They'll be able to retain a lot more.

755
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,599
And without it, critically,

756
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,839
patients forget 90%

757
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,559
of what they're told

758
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,799
by the next morning.

759
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,319
Which means that

760
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,840
the actual consult at the time,

761
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,880
face to face with the doctor

762
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,840
is mostly wasted

763
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,080
because you're saying things

764
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,760
that the patient isn't able to retain.

765
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:18,119
So, I got really passionate about,

766
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,959
patients should have recording.

767
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,319
We did this nationwide survey.

768
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,039
We found that almost 70%

769
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,415
of Americans really wish they could have had

770
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:26,439
an audio recording

771
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,279
of their last consult with the doctor.

772
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,559
4% actually walk away from

773
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,959
that consult with the recording today.

774
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,000
It's surprisingly high, I have to say.

775
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,654
Well, that includes

776
00:20:36,854 --> 00:20:39,995
the intent of our recording by the way.

777
00:20:40,195 --> 00:20:40,559
Right?

778
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,919
So, it's one of these things

779
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,959
where it's not super niche.

780
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,919
It turns out most patients

781
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,079
want to better understand

782
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,719
their doctors and medically

783
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,559
will do better

784
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,639
if they actually understand

785
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,267
their doctors.

786
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,519
Recordings are proven way of doing this.

787
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,279
Sharing those recordings with families,

788
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,119
are proven way of doing this.

789
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,719
And it's not yet endemic.

790
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,559
It's not yet something

791
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,839
that is just part of the standard

792
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,719
of practice of medical care.

793
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,759
So, I started designing Medcorder

794
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,919
just to make it really easy

795
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,359
for families to go and do this.

796
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,759
While I was still working at Google,

797
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,600
I released an early

798
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,640
engineering prototype,

799
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,560
and a few weeks

800
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,920
after it hit the App Store,

801
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,360
my Aunt Terry got diagnosed

802
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,840
with multiple myeloma

803
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,160
and started using the app,

804
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,080
even in its very early crashy state

805
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,720
to coordinate her medical care

806
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,000
and found it transformative.

807
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,520
And so I was like, Oh, man.

808
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,760
If my aunt is finding this super helpful

809
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,760
for her care in its current state,

810
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,960
I need to take this seriously.

811
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,240
So, I quit my job at Google,

812
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:36,319
went full time on Medcorder,

813
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,319
founded a team,

814
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,239
raised a seed round

815
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,319
from Future Ventures

816
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,519
and built a first class

817
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,000
native app for both

818
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,480
iOS and for Android.

819
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,040
As well as Web interface.

820
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,359
And so, we've got about

821
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,279
20,000 patients and family members

822
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,359
across the United States.

823
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,400
We're in US only right now

824
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:54,719
that are using the app.

825
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,600
We've got a partnership

826
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,920
with UCSF Patient Support Corps.

827
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,400
We actually have

828
00:21:58,401 --> 00:21:59,559
our first clinical trial

829
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,200
that we kicked off two months ago

830
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,360
called mENCORE to validate

831
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,720
the use of Medcorder

832
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:07,279
with prostate cancer patient.

833
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,400
So, the results of that

834
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,440
should be out in Q2 of next year,

835
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,960
where we'll be able to prove

836
00:22:11,961 --> 00:22:14,639
that giving patients Medcorder is

837
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,479
is a really good idea

838
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,439
for a complex care condition.

839
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,399
So, I'm really passionate about

840
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,519
the radical proposition

841
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,999
that patients should understand

842
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,039
their doctors and Medcorder

843
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,879
is the vehicle for that mission.

844
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,159
David, so when you mentioned that

845
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,479
when you started off, you're still

846
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,559
you're just writing prototype.

847
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,159
So, I'm just using the prototype.

848
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,079
Were you writing actual prototype?

849
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,519
No. I'll be honest,

850
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,199
I contract it out with a dev shop

851
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,439
full stack dev shop to go and do it.

852
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,519
We wrote the front end in Flutter

853
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,519
and did the back end in Firebase.

854
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,199
And I was just providing

855
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,239
product direction.

856
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,639
Right?

857
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,160
I love it.

858
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,840
I mean, I love with the idea

859
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,880
that you obviously

860
00:22:56,881 --> 00:22:57,919
have all the capabilities

861
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,400
you need in order to build

862
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,120
these things yourself,

863
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,960
but you're leveraging

864
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:02,759
your passion and intuition

865
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,760
to help get these ideas across,

866
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,080
even using other skills.

867
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,440
And we have you know,

868
00:23:07,441 --> 00:23:09,959
it's a world wide economy right now.

869
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,559
If people all over the world

870
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:11,999
that can do it,

871
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,840
you're both supporting them.

872
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,040
You're getting this idea across

873
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,520
and now you've validated it.

874
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,840
You're going to help, you know,

875
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:18,679
potentially millions of people.

876
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,439
And it's almost as if

877
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,719
their life depends on it, literally.

878
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,079
Yeah.

879
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,719
So, I'm deeply inspired by this.

880
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,519
Oh, cool.

881
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,519
The full stack developer

882
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
who we ended up finding

883
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,600
through that firm

884
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,280
who's been full time on Medcorder

885
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,840
in the like for

886
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:33,119
two and a half years now,

887
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,720
we actually just this last month

888
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,960
brought on board to our team as

889
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,160
full time developer.

890
00:23:38,161 --> 00:23:40,919
He's based in Minsk in Belarus.

891
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,200
Wow.

892
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,000
That's just wonderful.

893
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,920
David, 20 minutes go by

894
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:47,199
way too quickly.

895
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,199
I really want to thank you

896
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,999
for the inspiration both now

897
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,840
and for the time you gave

898
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:51,759
seven years ago

899
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,519
at Hacking Generation Y.

900
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,759
I just love talking to you.

901
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,959
I love your energy.

902
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,519
And I resonate so well with your

903
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,240
trajectory and your optimizations

904
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,580
for learning.

905
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,919
I'm curious,

906
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,199
passionate person myself,

907
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,680
and this is,

908
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,320
I'm very direct and honest,

909
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,279
this is like a role model

910
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:09,759
for me right now.

911
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,039
Just listening to this

912
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,679
and seeing your journey,

913
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,399
really wonderful.

914
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,960
Before we end,

915
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,280
I have to ask you for three words

916
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,160
that you would use to describe yourself.

917
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,840
Or that any anybody

918
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,880
who knows you would describe you.

919
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,680
I start things.

920
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,880
I start things.

921
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,400
David, thank you so much.

922
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,600
Just phenomenal.

923
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,520
Thank you very, very much.

924
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,360
Stay safe and stealthy.

925
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:30,600
Take care.
