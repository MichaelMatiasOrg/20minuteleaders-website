1 David Golan, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute leaders. Thanks for having me. Well, artificial intelligence, health care, helping save lives, postdoc at Stanford, this is a complete honor of mine. So, I'm very very glad to have you. David, you're the CTO of Viz.ai. I can't believe you just tell you're over a hundred people across the US and Israel? That's just insane. David, right before we go back to your personal journey, give me a little bit of context what is Viz.ai and how do you integrate artificial intelligence with health care? So, our mission at Viz.ai is to facilitate better care for patients by applying artificial intelligence, detecting for example, stroke or other pathologies that require immediate attention and alerting the right physician immediately using our AI and using our own mobile platform so they can treat the patient much faster. So, just for context about the problem, you're saying this idea of detecting a stroke. When I think of somebody having a stroke, I think about the movies; I'm thinking about somebody who is stopping in the middle of the street; they're starting to realize that something is weird; they made me fall down and then eventually, somebody will call 911. I'm guessing that the problem is that oftentimes it's too late, right? I mean, that every second there counts. Yeah. So, stroke is the single most time critical condition in all of medicine, with the exception of a kid choking on a grape. Every minute that goes by, the patient loses two million neurons that translate to over four days of disability free life. So, it's really a race against time. And we all have these images from media of someone who is having a stroke and being rushed to the hospital. The sad fact is that the delays typically happen within the hospital system. So, the largest delays are after the patient is admitted, actually, more often than not even after the patient is imaged, so the patient was in a city scanner somewhere in a file system, there's a sequence of bits and bytes that tells this patient is having a stroke, but just the system it's human based, very sequential linear system is not efficient at triaging those patients identifying who needs emergent care and who doesn't. And sort of skipping the queue and making sure the right patient gets the right treatment. And this is basically what we do. Right. So, it's not a problem of proficiency, of taking care of it, but it's a problem of diagnosing the urgency of the situation, right? Exactly. Exactly. So, it's really not about, in the context of AI and radiology and interpreting scans, people will sort of saying: AI will replace the radiologist, that will not replace the radiologist, who's better. It's really not about being better. It's about being everywhere, 24/7, being diligent, never taking a break, which computers can do and humans can't. Not to mention the cost. So, the AI is always there in the cloud. Every single scan goes to the cloud. We're at about, I think, 45,000 scans a month now. Going to the cloud, being interpreted, about one out of ten is a stroke. The AI identifies the stroke, sends an alert, the physician gets alert. The physician, by the way, is more often than not in a different hospital or at home or driving or whatnot, they get the alert, they have a mobile platform, they can do the scans, they can communicate with the team. And this really changes the flow of health care from this sequential one step after the other very slow process. Something, everybody gets the alert. Everybody sinks in on the mobile platform, makes a decision, go go go, and treat the patient much much faster. So, just to paint me the picture again. Where is the scan taking place? So let's say I'm the one who is experiencing the health condition, where am I physically located while the scan is taking place? And why am I so disconnected from the whole health care system that you're talking about? Yeah. So, if you're unfortunate enough to have a stroke or to be suspected of a stroke, you will be taken to hospital, to an ER, and you will be scanned. Now, during 60 and 70% of the time, the facility that you're being scanned at does not have the full capability to treat you as a stroke patient. You will need to be triaged and transferred to another facility. It's called the Comprehensive Strokes Center. And I mean, immediately, if you've been in the hospital once, you know how inefficient this can be. Immediately you see there's chain of hand off that needs to happen. And remember, also, even in the smaller hospital, it's less experienced, they don't see as many strokes or they're not as practiced with it. And this is all due to human error, due to overload, due to a tired physician or just due to random stuff like someone calling someone else while they're already on the phone with a third party. Those delays introduced and those drops in this process. So, we completely eliminate this. And actually, if you're okay with this, I just want to share something from literally from earlier today. Yeah. Of course. I can send this afterwards. There's the post in LinkedIn from Piedmont. We just went live at Piedmont. It was exciting day for us at Piedmont. We have officially launched with Viz.ai cross our health system. Our first case came through and LVO, LVO is the type of stroke, was received even before the images made it to the system. Physician notes that Viz.ai saves at least 15 minutes on this case. 15 minutes? 15 minutes is 60 days of disability free life and saves 150 days of potential loss of functional independence. This is from today. This is like I shed a tear when I read that. David, I'm getting emotional here listening to you say that. So, you're reading this post, and I'm literally tearing up as I'm hearing this, because this is probably something that I'm the most passionate about, using technology to literally save lives. A lot of entrepreneurs go and build products that are trying to make the world a better place or have a positive impact. You're literally saving people's lives. And you're not just saving them from life and death, you're also saving their well-being. It's not just about whether they survive, but it's about their quality of life moving forward, which I think is completely inspiring. Talk to me a little bit about your personal journey going into this. So, you're teaching assistant at Tel Aviv University, you work on algorithms at VMware, you're a postdoc at Stanford. How do you go into this realm of artificial intelligence and transition into co-founding this amazing company? Yeah. So, it's a good question. And my background has been a bit random. Throughout my adult life, have been gravitating towards what's interesting and fun and challenging. And as you mentioned, I worked and I developed algorithms. In the tech industry, I did some cool stuff in my undergrad, masters and PhD. And I came to Stanford for a postdoc to focus on statistical learning and genetics and genomics and solve the world's problems. And I guess, two main things happened: one of them is, I guess, everything depends on luck. But I came to Stanford exactly when for the first time Convolutional Neural Networks class was taught at Stanford. And I was like completely randomly, I stumbled upon it and I said, "Well, let's go and listen what is this stuff that keeps coming up recently." "Everybody saying this is a big deal." And I go there, one or two lectures. And it's obvious that this is a game changer. It's obvious that something really really big is happening here. It's not another method, another algorithm. It's really about something that's going to change a lot of things. Do you remember who was teaching the class back then? Yeah. It was Andrej Karpathy, famous CS231n to like everybody whose done it. CS231n, it's the notorious class of Convolutional Neural Networks. Yes. So, I mean, that was the first time it was done at Stanford and it was absolutely mind blowing. Wow. I mean, immediately I said, "Okay. Let's see how we can apply that in research, in genetics and genomics." And start dabbling with medical imaging, started playing with all sorts of stuff. Completely unrelated to that, I actually, the story I told you about the patient being scanned and so on, I actually experienced it. I was admitted about five years ago to Stanford Hospital with a suspected stroke. Really. Yeah. So, actually, it ended up not being a stroke. And that's a different neurological thing that's completely reversible. And I'm fine and healthy. So, don't worry, but like everything I tell you about the delays, about the disconnect, I literally experience those being like unable to speak; paralyzed in half of my body; on a bed at Stanford looking out and saying, "What the hell is going on?" "Why are things taking so long?" And it is one of the best hospitals in the world. Exactly. it was like Monday morning, you wouldn't feel like Christmas Eve or something. It was absolutely, absolutely mind blowing. So, half of the brain is super freaked out that I'm going to be disabled to rest of my life. And half of the brain is like, "What the fuck is going on?" I'm sorry. I don't know how to say that. You can delete it. No no no. This is 100% okay. And I was fortunate to meet my co-founder, Chris Mansi. I was introduced actually following this incident by a mutual friend. Chris is a neurosurgeon by training. And he was at the business school at Stanford and we actually met at a friend's, sitting in his backyard on the bonfire and I told him my story. And he says to me, "Dude, you're lucky you're alive." "Everything is fine." "I lost dozens of patients on my operating table over stupid stuff like someone not picking up the phone at the right time." "And I actually came to Stanford to fix this." And like, we started talking, "How would you fix this?" If everything was automatic, if computers were there instead of humans, things would have been much better. And I remember, we actually Googled on his phone some images and I look and said, "I think with deep learning we can probably automate this." Unbelievable. When was this? How long ago was this? This was beginning of 2016. Wow. So, we're talking about four years ago. And fast forward, and you're running over a hundred person company and you're saving lives. So, talk to me a little bit about what's happening today. So, you're saying you have 45,000 scans a month. 10% of those are our stroke cases. Which means that in the current state, you're literally helping save the lives of 4,500 people, either saving them from life and death or saving their well-being for hundreds of days, right? Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, now we've seen very rapid adaption in the US. We're live in over 500 hospital, seeing a lot of patients. Accumulating evidence that implementation of this software reduces the time, improves patient outcomes, reduces length of stay in the hospital and all that coming from different hospital systems across the US. So, it's fairly robust. Yeah, it's really exciting. We're launching new products. We're expanding beyond stroke. We have a brain bleed product. We have a few others that are coming down the pipeline. Yeah. It's actually been a lot of fun. So, David, I have to ask company culture. Because it's something that's fascinating for me as a young entrepreneur myself and thinking about leadership and what it means to really motivate people, and I'm seeing my class at Stanford and my friends from 8200, it's all about mission driven companies. We want to join companies that are mission driven, that have a purpose that we feel a part of a community. I'm assuming this, but if you're looking at the hundred plus people that are working at Viz.ai, is there a shared goal here? Do people understand the magnitude of what you're achieving here? Well, I think the answer is yes. We put a lot of effort into it and it's super important. Furthermore, we have a core values and the number one value and by far the most important is patient first. And it's really about the patients. Even recognizing that it's about the patients, not even about the users or what is paying for the product. We have different backgrounds in the company. People coming from health care, which is a lot of the commercial/ customer phasing, they get it immediately. We have a customer success team, many of them are stroke nurses and stroke coordinators jumped ship because they understand that this is the way to really transform. In Israel, we have an engineering team and we're slightly removed from what's going on. So, we do a lot. We have all hands, we have what we call the magic moment section where we share one or two stories like the one I shared with you earlier. We have our brain time fashion, we call it, it's a 30 minute every week where we just review interesting cases, what happened; did they use the app; did they use it properly; did something strange happened. So, yes, we really try to connect even every single person in the company to the fact, I mean, this is what differentiates from others this Viz as place of work. You can go work in other places, some may even pay you more money, but I strongly believe it's one of those places where you can see a very direct line from your work to numbers of lives saved. Unbelievable. So, talk to me a little bit about this intersection of artificial intelligence and health care and medicine in general. Where is this headed? Because this is something that I guess, 10, 15 years ago, there wasn't too much innovation going on with, especially using these technologies and completely transforming the way that health care is processed. And just like the amazing things that you're doing, there's other companies like Zebra Medical Vision that are doing phenomenal things and other companies around the world. What is the trend? And how can people that are perhaps, pursuing a PhD in artificial intelligence or that are mathematicians, how can they find this smooth integration in implementing these algorithms into actual sustainable products that can actually improve people's lives? I guess that's a million dollar question. And I think there's few ways to attack. First of all, in terms of the trends, yes, for a very long time, not a lot has happened. And I think most of the reason is that people focused on trying to beat humans at their own game by creating better. There was a lot of focusing on ecology, for example, in breast mammography, trying to be better than a human in a very hard task. What we did at Viz, which was the first and it was a new regulation created by the FDA for us, was not to compete with humans in their own game, but say, where does the computer have an advantage where time is of the essence. All right. So actually, algorithms are not more accurate than humans. Humans like the expert reading this head scan, they don't miss a stroke. It's not about accuracy. It's about getting them in front of the right patient at the right time. And there you can show very very substantial clinical benefit. We convinced the FDA they created a new regulation called Computer Aided Triage for this. And now, I just actually, recently we did a survey about 30 devices in this category using us as a predicate, and this has become the number one way for AI companies to have a foot in the door in the health care system. So, what is the lesson? I don't think the lesson is you should go do triage. I think the main thing is that you have to sort of forget about AI, and we have AI know a name here, but let's forget about the AI for a second and you have to really find a problem that needs fixing. A pain point that's so painful to patients, to physicians, and also to the financial people of the hospital, because stroke is financially a very big deal. It's actually the number one health care expense in the US. Wow. And then you say, "What do I need to fix it?" And AI may be part of the solution. And by the way, when I think of Viz, when we ask our customers, "What is the biggest feature of Viz that you like the most?" AI doesn't always come up first. It's part of the whole solution. The solution is a technology, a mobile viewer, skill chat they can use, it's AI. It's also a customer success representative that really understands stroke and works with them to improve their stroke workflow and how they leverage what Viz has to offer to improve their own workloads on. So, it's really holistic. So, what I'm trying to say is if you're an AI practitioner and you have a hammer and you're now looking for a nail, everything looks like a nail. Don't do that. First, find the problem. Convince yourself that there's a clinical case, a business case, and then if AI can help you, wonderful. 100%. And it's inspiring because what I'm gathering from this, and you're saying it's not the AI that is Viz. It's Viz and AI is a component. It's a tail of Viz. And you're providing this holistic experience that is trying to capture a lot of the misalignment within the industry or within the process of a potential stroke patient. The AI is sort of the helper tool to allow that to happen. But it's all these other resources, whether it's the customer success person or the secure chat, or understanding the problems of that specific organization. And I think that's a really big lesson that I'm taking from this. Because as a technology enthusiast myself, I'm constantly reminding myself that it's not just about the algorithm, it's not just about the code. It's about how do you actually bring this to market and make it something that's useful. David, this was inspiring and insightful. Thank you for taking the time to do this. And I'm sure that it's running over one hundred person company and doing the things that you're doing, I'm definitely very very honored that you're willing to do this. But before we leave, I have to ask for three words that you would use to describe yourself. Okay. So, the first one, I think it's two words, but it's [--] I would say, naive/ optimistic. Like people make fun of me all the time. I always think some things are like would be really easy to do, and they always turn out to be harder. But you have to believe that you can do it and that it's possible, so take the first step. And I think the second one would be something big for me right now, it's being a father. I'm a father of three. And we have a six month baby that was born just before the lockdown here. Wow. So, kids are probably a big thing, but recently, even more than that. And the third thing I would say, I thought about going with geek, nerd thing, but I actually went with a statistician. I'm a Holocaust statistician by training. I do machine learning and stuff, but my training is statistics. And I consider myself a statistician who apply statistics to how he thinks about the world. And that actually has been extremely useful at the Viz journey and in life in general. So, yeah, I guess we'll go to those three. David, thank you very much. Toda raba. Keep helping save people's lives. And I'll keep following the journey. Thank you very much. Thank you.
