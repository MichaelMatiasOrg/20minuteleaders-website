 00
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.195
Gigi Levy Weiss, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

00
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.005
It's so great to have you.

00
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.225
Thanks for having me.

00
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.085
Where are you calling from? From Israel right now?

00
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:35.225
I'm in Israel. In this small place called Rishpon which is just outside of Tel Aviv.

00
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.165
Next to the beach. Yup, can't complain.

00
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:41.155
Wonderful. Wonderful. Amazing. So, you know.

00
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.225
Gigi, you're one of the most prominent investors in Israel.

00
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.105
And I'm gonna allow myself not to be humbled at this point. You can be humble later on.

00
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:54.075
But you know, from amazing time as CEO of 888 Holdings to an incredible angel investor,

00
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.205
family man, Board of Directors of some incredible non-profits that are doing some really

00
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:05.055
noteworthy work in Israel and abroad. I'd love to spend these 20 minutes just to you know,

00
00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:10.205
peek to your brain on, who are you? and how do you find these incredible opportunities?

00
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:16.115
How do you go about investing in a seed stage company, in people?

00
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.235
Rather than you know, just look in matrix and ideas. Can you just give me a little bit start about 

00
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.015
What's your biggest passion and what really motivates you?

00
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:34.285
Wow. So I'd say at the end of the day I think that what I really enjoyed doing is working with amazing people.

00
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:42.265
I'm a people's person and not working with people is difficult for me and so, whatever I do,

00
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:47.995
when I founded companies, when I was a CEO, when I was in the military. It was always in roles that

00
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.235
I could surround myself with amazing people. And I think that when I left my last CEO position

00
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:59.195
which was nine or ten years ago, and I started thinking what I wanna do with the rest of my time.

00
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:06.275
And I was just to take another CEO position but what occur to me is that what I really like about

00
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:14.215
being the CEO was working with people, on product, on strategy, on solving issues.

00
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:19.255
What I really didn't like is working on how many vacation days people are getting.

00
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:26.195
And who's getting a salary raise or not. And you know, doing all these other things including investor relations

00
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.185
Because the last job was a public company. And I'd really didn't like that. And so, I said,

00
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:36.195
"Maybe I can find a job that has only the things that I like. Without the things I don't like."

00
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:41.255
And basically, investing in early stage start up does that. it is the perfect combination for me because I

00
00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:48.075
spend as long as the founders want me to. I spend time with them on everything that I love.

00
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:53.995
And everywhere where I can bring value. And you know, thank God I'm still close to being operational enough

00
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.215
to be able to bring some value. But I don't deal with everyday company management.

00
00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:03.275
I love that. So you're a very active investor. You form a partnership with your founders.

00
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.995
And you enjoy you working in with them beyond just the noticeable check size that you're providing them.

00
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.215
So, I think that I've invested over the years. As an angel, I've invested in more than 120 companies over many years.

00
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:23.095
Over 16 years now. I started when I was still having a day job. And this was a hobby, like everybody else’s.

00
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:29.065
And so, 120 companies. And then we had an accelerator for a period of time so that was another 80.

00
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:34.125
And then in the fund, we invested in more than 40. And so, I've touched many entrepreneurs.

00
00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:41.195
And I think that my biggest pride is that I think all of them other than really a handful

00
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.045
are people that I would invest in again, are people that I enjoyed working with.

00
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:52.165
And are people that are really amazing individuals that ended up being also friends.

00
00:14:52.170 --> 00:15:00.185
And so you know, one of the biggest difference in, we're a fund that being set up by three founders

00
00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:06.255
Pete, James, and me, and I think one of the biggest difference is between us and other funds

00
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.285
you know there are also other great funds, one of the biggest differences is that

00
00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:18.115
we remember what being the founder is like and you'd never hear us say things like, "My company."

00
00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.255
When I talk about a company where I invested in you know. We don't think that by giving the company money

00
00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:28.000
became our company. We are lucky to be able to join the journey of entrepreneurs

00
00:15:28.005 --> 00:15:31.065
and help as much as we can hopefully.

00
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:39.035
But that doesn't make it our company. And that doesn't make it in any way, that doesn't give us the right to think

00
00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:44.235
that because we gave money, we called the shots. It is the founders’ company. The founders are in the trenches.

00
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.155
They are the ones not sleeping at night. They’res the one working 24 hours a day.

00
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.215
We're just joining the ride and trying to help as much as we can. And so yes,

00
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:58.995
we have a very deep partnership with the founders. Many times, the people ask me, "Do you insist to be on the Board?"

00
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.145
And I say, "Look I don't insist being on the Board but I do insist on being the last meeting before the Board."

00
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:09.085
Meaning, I want to be that person that is on the side of the founders. Close to the founders.

00
00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:14.015
So that before they decide how they present things, they come to me and say, "What do you think?"

00
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.225
And that's the kind of relationship we have with the founders we invest in.

00
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:21.005
And just to give you a bit of context. On another interview I saw that you mention

00
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:28.105
that you're seeing about 2000 deals a year. Out of those you have invested in specific year in about seven 

00
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:31.005
So, you really do pick the founders that you get to work with.

00
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:36.025
And it's not just writing a check to any nice person that comes by the door but it's more than that.

00
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:40.285
I think you also mentioned something along the lines of, "When we look an opportunity,

00
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:47.175
we look at 70% on the people, 20% of the field, and 10% into the idea." Talk to me about that.

00
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.105
What does that mean 70% of the people?

00
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:57.115
So, the first thing I think that what people need to understand is that the earlier we invest in more waits we give to the people

00
00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:03.075
Right. If you're investing in a growth round where the company is already making $15 million revenues,

00
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.205
and you can see the churn, and you can see exactly then at the end of the day

00
00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:11.065
clearly, you're also wanna be in love with the founding team and the management team.

00
00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:15.105
But in a way, a company that sells $15 million maybe there's another CEO also that can do the job

00
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:20.265
If the founder decides to leave or something. So, you're basically putting a lot of focus on the product

00
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:27.095
on the numbers, on what's really working and not working. And then there's of course, that's to the people.

00
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:33.205
or less to the people. If you go precede, all the way to the beginning. When you invest on to a bunch of people,

00
00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:37.015
Sometimes one or two people with the deck. Sometimes there's not even a deck.

00
00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:43.115
Sometimes the deck is horrible. When you invest in them, then most of the weight you're putting is on the people.

00
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:51.175
And when I try to quantify it I look back so I would ask these question first time, I think six or seven years ago

00
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:58.135
And so, I said, "Could I try to create an algorithm that basically tells me what to do and I'll get back to this in the second.

00
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:05.005
Because we have created this." And I try to understand what was my guiding line and so, the reality is that

00
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:11.105
I say it's 70% to the people because that's the most important thing. It's a 20% to the field and 10% to the idea.

00
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:18.015
However, there's a bunch of disclaimers around it. The first disclaimer is that there are field that I don't invest in.

00
00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:25.195
And so why it's only 20%? It's binary so you know. Yes. The field impacts, if it's one of the fields I invest in

00
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:31.215
I give 20%. But if it's for example semiconductors that we don't invest in, then clearly that's binary.

00
00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:39.035
Yup. Similarly, with the idea. The idea is if it's the right team and the right field, I really don't care about the idea too much.

00
00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.000
Because that's gonna change a in time. However, if the idea is really bad,

00
00:18:43.005 --> 00:18:46.255
that's gonna impact my analysis of the team, right?

00
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:53.245
If they came with a really really bad idea then it impacts. So, it is really a bit more balance but in reality is that

00
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:57.255
most of our decision making ideally state is a lot around the team.

00
00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:02.145
Okay. So, Gigi, between us and between the couple of thousand others that are gonna watch this,

00
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:10.195
Out of the 120 angel investments plus 40 with the fund, how many do you feel that you had a personal impact

00
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:15.135
on the journey of the founder? A positive impact. An honest question.

00
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:25.125
Yeah. So, I think that clearly, I need to be careful here because my explanation to myself of the hard work that I'm putting in

00
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:28.245
has gotta be conditioned on me believing that I'm making an impact.

00
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:35.175
And so, clearly, I'm biased and I think that I made tremendous impact on everybody.

00
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:46.195
But realistically, I think that in every company that I've invested in there is being a bunch of points where

00
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.105
clearly, they could have gotten maybe the same device from somebody else smarter than me.

00
00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:57.075
But i think there were a couple of points where me being there at the right time with the right answer.

00
00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:04.065
Save them time. Or save them money. Or got them to the right place. Now, there are areas where their companies were

00
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:10.000
we saw the company first $700 million. I brought the buyer. I negotiated the deal.

00
00:20:10.005 --> 00:20:15.135
I closed the deal. And so that's very tangible.

00
00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:22.085
But I think that actually, the most important ones are the ones where that are not around.

00
00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:26.225
You know, me being involve with big success. It's me being involve in the tough times.

00
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:35.225
Late night calls. Exactly, you know. Somebody leaving and everybody's broken. Or the product's not working.

00
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:41.035
And you need to reiterate again and again and again. And you need somebody to look you in the eyes

00
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.035
and tell you that this is what’s happening to everybody. And that's okay and you shouldn't break.

00
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:51.285
Or these times where somebody is coming to you and you just don't wanna continue doing what he's doing

00
00:20:51.290 --> 00:21:00.045
because it's so tiring and so difficult and you give them an honest analysis of why they should or why they shouldn’t.

00
00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:06.135
I think that you know, one of the things I'm most proud of is that I think that every once in a while

00
00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:11.175
I ran into somebody that comes to me and tell me, "Do you know you saved me for years of my life.

00
00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:17.055
And I owe you for that, a lot more than I owe the people that they told me to continue."

00
00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:20.245
Because sometimes you know, from where you sit you see things differently.

00
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:26.285
And you know that some thing's not gonna work. Or you know that something is in the wrong direction.

00
00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:32.00
Or you know competition, or you know which way ahead in a way that's gonna be tough to catch up.

00
00:37:55.180 --> 00:38:01.215
So, you are just telling me about the time you find founders are much more appreciative when you actually

00
00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:07.045
when they confide in you their worries and you actually are there for them and you give them some advice

00
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.995
that could actually save them some dreadful years.

00
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:17.075
Yeah. I think that at the end of the day a lot the advice that I give people is not necessarily on huge things.

00
00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:23.085
What I found over the years is that, yes of course every once in a while, there's a big strategy session

00
00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:30.235
and I can help in that and that's great. But the reality is that a lot of it is on the small things

00
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:37.215
And so, if our founder decides that he needs to let go of somebody and he's never done that before

00
00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:42.235
He's never let go of anybody in the United States, or he's never done this or that.

00
00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:47.145
And these things, you can either not spend a month in understanding how to do it

00
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:54.035
or you can ask somebody in your place who did it before or you need to sign an agreement with an affiliate.

00
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.165
You've never done that before. You don't know what to do. And so, these are the kind of things

00
00:38:57.170 --> 00:39:07.045
that I think many times, the relationship are kind of very practically it could be, "What's ups?" in the middle of the night.

00
00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.135
I'm gonna ask you Gigi. Do you have two minutes?

00
00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:14.165
Is it WhatsApp message? Or is it a weekly meeting? A phone call? Email?

00
00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:19.265
So, I think that it's a combination. It's all of the above and it's a combination.

00
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:27.205
And the reality is that usually with most companies I have a weekly call or sometimes if the frequency does not require that

00
00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:33.225
Maybe every two weeks. But then there would be emails. And there would be WhatsApp’s,

00
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:40.085
and there would be messengers and messages and so on. And everybody was kind of pinned me at the right moment

00
00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:44.235
and I try to keep time in my calendar to basically get back to everybody.

00
00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:52.145
Because the point is that a lot of these advice is very timely and so if you can't give the answer now

00
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:57.085
then the answer is not that valuable. Because the founder already had to go to others

00
00:39:57.090 --> 00:40:01.215
and asked questions and consult the lawyers and so on.

00
00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:07.035
And also, if you need to make a product decision you know. If they want to ask you something about new design,

00
00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.065
you can't give them the answer in three days. The sprints already over.

00
00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:16.075
Okay Gigi. Hold on. You're invested in over a hundred companies. You're still running a fund.

00
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:21.205
And you're actively looking at thousands of opportunities per year. How do you make time to answer people?

00
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:25.185
Literally, how tangibly do you make the time to go and answer WhatsApp?

00
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:32.995
So first of all, I think that I work more than I ever thought I'm gonna work as an investor, that's a reality.

00
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.095
For all of you out there, the thing that investor life is kind of going to the beach every day.

00
00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:43.285
You may have the option to go to the beach every day because theoretically nobody tells you what to do.

00
00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:48.155
But actually, that does not happen. And it will take them about five years to realize that you haven't done much. Yeah

00
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:52.135
Exactly. So, i work more than I ever did. That's one thing. 

00
00:40:52.140 --> 00:41:00.055
The second thing is that I'm a very very very efficient and effective time manager.

00
00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:07.115
My days are very very tight. I work at very high energy throughout the day and many of the nights sadly.

00
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:12.065
And that's that. And I think that.

00
00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:17.035
I'll tell you a story. Many years ago, when I started my first company, actually my second company,

00
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:23.235
And I was after being an air force pilot and I was used to this ecosystem where basically people respond to each, you know.

00
00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.135
You have a question. You asked somebody and they answer.

00
00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:34.145
And I remember trying to sell my product many years ago and I would send emails to people and they would not reply.

00
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:44.125
And I would beg then if they could still put a bit a job I could into the email that allowed you to know the defects.

00
00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:49.085
You open it and read it. And so, I would see that they're reading the email and not answering and I'm like,

00
00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:55.115
What's happening here? Couldn't you just click reply and say "No."

00
00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.275
Or if you want to be nasty, click reply and say "Never write me again."

00
00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:07.285
But something and nothing. And I took a commitment that it doesn't matter who I am and how successful I am

00
00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:14.255
That's never gonna happen to people writing me. So, everybody writing me always gets a reply. 

00
00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:20.095
I try to make it very fast. Some kind of a inbox zero person but it's difficult sometimes.

00
00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:31.995
And that's a commitment that takes a lot of my time. But it's also a lot of energy that I give back into the ecosystem

00
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.235
Or I try to give back. And also, I mean let's be frank. Every company that asked me a question or

00
00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:46.275
every new business plan that I look at a deck, it's not just for the benefit of those I'm replying to

00
00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:52.125
I'm also learning from it. Right. So every day I read, I look at the deck and I say, "Wow, that's interesting."

00
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:57.165
I didn't know that this business is so large. I didn't know that these are competitors in this field.

00
00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:01.275
I didn't know that there's a new way to do something. And so, I'm trying to learn from everything.

00
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:07.005
And so, yeah, it's a lot of work.

00
00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:11.285
Do you have a systematic approach of how you appreciate the deal flow that you have?

00
00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:17.255
So, let’s say you have a few hundred deals per month. Is there a certain way which you approach these deals?

00
00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:22.125
Or is it okay based on the industry, based on the way the founders are communicating with you?

00
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:28.125
You mean how do I evaluate? How do you judge a deal? How do I evaluate?

00
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:36.025
So, there's basically two things. The first thing is that for years now is that what I'm doing is I'm reading everything.

00
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:43.285
And then I started what i call the email ping pong which is base at playing email table tennis with founders asking questions.

00
00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:48.750
These questions basically they save me time from having meetings.

00
00:43:48.755 --> 00:43:54.085
But they also allow me to see how could the founders

00
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:56.255
deal with questions. Deal with hard questions.

00
00:43:56.260 --> 00:44:02.185
Are these binary questions like will they make it to the next round for a meeting or not?

00
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:09.065
None of them are questions that you know, there's no chi chi that people are sending around

00
00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:15.065
"Gigi's asking you these questions." But I am looking at a single key that you know, it's could be around competition,

00
00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:18.215
Could be around product, could be around team, could be around anything else.

00
00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:26.285
And basically, what I'm seeing is not just what they say, but also how they say it, and how fast they say it.

00
00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:33.095
And how do they take criticism. And how do they take that out. And how do they take the harder questions

00
00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:37.075
that indicate that I maybe not as impressive as they would like me to be.

00
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.175
And you'd be shocked how much you can find out from these things. And so you know.

00
00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:46.265
And if somebody, I mean let's face reality. If somebody sends me a deck and I send him a few questions

00
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:51.065
and it takes him four or five days to get back to me and he doesn't have a good answer.

00
00:44:51.070 --> 00:45:00.185
Like you know, "Sorry I was in military service or something." then I mean, if it takes four or five days to get back to me

00
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:06.115
How long would it take him to get back to customer? How long would it take him to get back to a candidate?

00
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.995
How long would it take him to get back to an investor? Another investor.

00
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.185
Right, right. Not just on the seed round. But you're also thinking about the future rounds.

00
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:16.045
And how can you get more partners on board. Exactly. So, I learned from that. 

00
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:18.000
And so, for like from every 10 companies that I get,

00
00:45:18.005 --> 00:45:23.155
there would be probably four or five that are either in field that I totally don't invest in

00
00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:30.025
Or competing with something that I'm already investing in. So, let's say that half of them I can disqualify very quickly.

00
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:37.095
Then there's gonna be around another three that will be disqualified in the ping-pong.

00
00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:42.115
Once I understand the business better and I see. And then for every ten, there's two that I end up meeting.

00
00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:50.035
Okay. And being that I'm getting around almost 10 every day, every work day.

00
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:57.155
Then that ends up being about 30 or 40 meetings a month. That's usually end up being less than one investment a month.

00
00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:00.035
So, it's a pretty crazy flow.

00
00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:07.145
That's pretty pretty crazy. Gigi, do you know just a minute or, 'cause we're almost out of time and I'm so sad about it

00
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:13.045
Talk to me about covid-19. We're almost, it looks like we're starting to see the light again at the tunnel.

00
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:18.025
By the time this interview is published, hopefully it's much much better than it already it is right now

00
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:21.000
Fast track and effects, you did something that's very contrariant

00
00:46:21.005 --> 00:46:24.065
to a lot of other founders around the world. Talk to me about that.

00
00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:32.055
So, I think that we started seeing that with covid everybody was kinda retracting and not investing anymore or investing less.

00
00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:37.145
And clearly, by the way the best teams and the best CEOs continued raising money. That's good.

00
00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:41.205
But everybody else it also needs to raise money and grow.

00
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:49.075
And we looked at it and we said that, it's either that we, like everybody else gonna say, "We’ll wait and see."

00
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:54.225
Or we try to challenge the industry and actually do what we think is the right thing

00
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:56.265
Which is actually to invest more in seed at this stage. Why?

00
00:46:56.270 --> 00:47:02.215
Because seed companies are basically company that are gonna work now for a few months on their product.

00
00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:06.095
They're not dependent on the current recession or non-recession.

00
00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:10.005
It's the best time to be heads on and working on your product.

00
00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:16.215
And basically, the innovation economy does not need to stop. It is the future and we need to continue fueling it.

00
00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:21.205
And you know we have money. We're given money barrel piece to invest it and not to sit on it.

00
00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:24.275
And so we said let's do something which is exactly the opposite.

00
00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:28.075
So, when everybody else were saying, “We’re slowing down.”, we said, "We're accelerating."

00
00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:32.235
What did we do? We took all the capabilities that we had before which are product that we built

00
00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.225
like the company brief which allows us to get structured data.

00
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:40.025
It allows everybody to send data about their company to investors. Wonderful.

00
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:47.165
And so we told everybody, "If you're submitting a company brief to us and you're looking at the investment docs we put out,

00
00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:52.125
because we don't want any negotiations on the documentaries, or standard safe documents 

00
00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:56.055
They're completely standard and you can read them beforehand.

00
00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:59.215
And you know exactly what's gonna be the evaluation. You know exactly what's gonna be the standards we're taking.

00
00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:05.235
So that depending on your stages, it's always 15% for one million or one and a half million or two million

00
00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:10.225
then we promise initial feedback in three days. And a decision in nine days.

00
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:16.995
Wow. And we're not saying exactly how much we got but I can tell you that it's in the thousands.

00
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:28.275
Wow. And I can tell you that basically we are likely to have built a very robust system.

00
00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:33.115
Technological system that basically helps us digest everything.

00
00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:39.005
And so, every deal that comes in, it's being ranked by our algorithms.

00
00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:46.195
It doesn't mean that, we never say no without a human watching it. So, you know this is not an automated business.

00
00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:54.225
This is a decision support system more than anything else. However, we're clearly riping right now.

00
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:59.065
We're enjoying the fruits of the hard work we've done over the last few years.

00
00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:02.205
Because every company that comes in now, I know exactly what to look at.

00
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:07.055
I know exactly what are the things that need to pay attention to.

00
00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:12.275
And then that also allows us to write more details in rejection emails to those that we reject.

00
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:18.265
Or to ask the right questions to the one we wanna continue with. And so far, we made a new investments and we love it.

00
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:24.045
Wow. So, Gigi, once an entrepreneur, always an entrepreneur. That obviously comes across.

00
00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:28.055
And you know, I had so many things I wanted talk about about your experiences in air force pilot

00
00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:31.245
and comparing that some other things that you experienced as a founders, an investor.

00
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:36.015
And a bit about who you are as a person. And the things that really really make you passionate.

00
00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:40.125
But one thing that I have to say that I'm hugely inspired by is the high energy.

00
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:42.235
And that something I'm trying to practice myself.

00
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:46.225
I'm trying to learn how can I bring the highest energy to my work ethic.

00
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:50.995
And to the meetings that I hold. And to reallly maximize the time that I'm working with people.

00
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:58.065
And providing value. And knowing to put myself away from the position where I don't add value.

00
00:49:58.070 --> 00:50:00.085
Which is I think often one of the hardest things to do.

00
00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:03.105
You know, at the end of the day, a lot of this is being truthful to yourself you know.

00
00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:10.285
What many people do is that they take something up on themselves or they’re in the meeting or something

00
00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:16.165
and they're not giving everything. You know they're reading emails, they're thinking about something else.

00
00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:21.145
Which is fine. Everybody has these moments. However, if you wanna be truthful to yourself,

00
00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:26.145
then when you are in something, you need to be 100% in it.

00
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:30.075
I love it. And if you can't be 100% in it, then you're probably in the wrong place.

00
00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.285
Then find a better place for yourself.

00
00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:35.285
Gigi, I love it. I know you're so busy and I have to let you go. But very last question.

00
00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:39.085
I need three words that best describe you.

00
00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:46.995
Yeah, so you know. I think that at the end of the day, a more interesting exercise is like a sentence

00
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:57.005
Just like the three words. But if I, you gave me 20 minutes heads up that I need to come up with this so.

00
00:50:57.010 --> 00:50:58.185
Not nearly enough.

00
00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:04.165
But I think that if I, this is something that I've been thinking a lot about myself, about my life, about being a parent

00
00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:14.265
about my kids. And you know, the three values at the end of the day that I think that if I had to choose

00
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:20.225
what would be the one that I would love to use to define myself,

00
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:24.005
the three are Love, Passion, and Care.

00
00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:31.165
These are the three. And I think that you know, all three of them, in the way do not sound like business-related ones.

00
00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:38.235
But they are the core of every business success. It's love, passion, and care.

00
00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:45.035
And I think that if I had the chance to add a couple more,

00
00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:48.195
one of them would be Learning, and the other one would be Speak.

00
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:52.085
Right. Which are more kind of concrete to the business world.

00
00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:56.135
But love, passion, and care the ones that I think, would love to think are defining me.
