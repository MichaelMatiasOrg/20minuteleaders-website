1 Shiran Elizur, thank you so much for being on my show. How are you? I'm well. How are you? Fantastic. Thank you so much for being so generous with your time. And I know you have your daughters at home and you're out of the office, and I truly truly appreciate it. I have so much to learn from you with your experience in all of different companies. But most recently now in Super-Pharm, running their brand development and thinking of the next brands that the customers want, right? Right. Incredible. Okay. So, for those that are perhaps in California, not in Tel Aviv right now, Super-Pharm is one of Israel's largest pharmacy chain. It's like the regular CVS and Walgreens that we have here, where you go in and you have both Super-Pharm items, but you also have an abundance of other brands in the store that it's like a go-to place. So, Shiran, before we dive into Super-Pharm and your work there, give me a little bit of background into who you are and the journey that you've gone through to get to the world that you have today. I actually stumbled upon it by chance. I was living in New York doing my masters at the new school, and I was looking for an internship. Which internships, if it's not like Google or Microsoft, they are not very big in Israel. So when I went to the IDC, I was just a waitress. Work to make a living and to pay the rent. But when I moved to New York, it was obviously a great, amazing opportunity to be a part of great companies. So, I actually was working in the hospitality industry like events and clubs, basically. Someone who knew someone in Revlon got me an interview. I was accepted. I was a master's student along with lots of like college girls. But still, it turned out quite okay because I stayed there for a while after. So, I was a part of the product development team. By the way, was that a turn off or was that difficult to go into a US based internship where a lot of people there are college students that are much younger than you? No, I didn't mind. So, first of all, I was quite young. I mean, I was only 25. It's not like I was like in my 30s or something. And I didn't really mind because they were all a part of the PR team and I was in the product development team. So, I have a different position and different things to do. Later then, I actually joined this PR team as, just to work there for a few months as well, and then I move to another company. So actually, I mean, I always love brands. Also, food wise and in general, I always found it interesting also as a little girl. What is a brand? Give me your insight into a two minute lecture. What constitutes a brand in the 21st century? I feel like it's mostly an emotion. Or something that makes you feel something. For me, not because I work there, but Super-Pharm is the strongest brand for me as being a woman. Being in my 30s, being a mother. And it was always a feeling for me, even back when I was 16, back when I was a soldier. Because this retailer, this chain, like their logo and everything, walks with you through your life. But I can also think of brands, obviously like Glossier, that make you feel special. That are making you feel unique. And they have to do with how you feel about yourself, how you position yourself. So, I think they are, first of all, emotions. And second, they are tools to identify and differentiate yourself in society, among other people, especially today. Especially when talking to gen setters. It's all about how you differentiate yourself. What does using or purchasing or wearing the brand tells about you. What does it say when you post on your Instagram that you shot something or did you support your brand or are you disappointed. Right. Right. So, It's mostly about self Identification, differentiation for yourself as the persona and emotion. I love it. Okay. So, let's transition now to what you're doing today. So, you have your experience at Revlon. And you've also had experience within a packaging company, that distributes beauty products. Right. They make package development like they work with everyone, with the entire L'Oreal group, with Estee Lauder Group, with Chanel, now she said with everyone. And I learned a lot there working with Mac and with Bobby Brown and with all the big names. Obviously, again, I was a writer after school. So I took whatever they gave me. And it started with running errands for everyone and sitting in the messenger center with everyone. And I did it with much love and dedication. And it taught me a lot. But then I decided, along with my husband, to come back here to Israel because we wanted to start a family. In New York, obviously, it's not even relevant money wise. So, we came back here and I worked for four years in April cosmetics, which is like a specialty beauty. It's more like on the selective higher end tier. A bit more than two and a half years ago, I moved to Super-Pharm, which was like a dream come true for me. Super-Pharm for me, it's for retail. It's like it's Google. Really. Yeah. Yeah. So, just give me the context a little bit into the Israeli ecosystem and where is Super-Pharm is located within that. Because I think it's important for the remainder of the conversation to understand the incredible work you're doing within Super-Pharm. To understand how big Super-Pharm is and how it integrates into the lives of every Israeli. But it's actually not just Israelis, but it's also abroad. Right. First of all, Israel is a tiny country. It's only nine million people. And Super-Pharm has 260 doors. So, it's literally everywhere. It's a 10-minute drive from every Israelis house, basically. Every Israelis house. Yeah, it's in the radius of everyone's, it's in neighborhoods, in malls. And it's everywhere. It's the leading and larges health and beauty retailer here in Israel. Its private label is huge. And because we have those capabilities, manufacturing, shipping, logistic capabilities, we decided two and a half years ago to also operate as a distributor. So, we also work directly with brands, not manufacturers, that create the life brand for our private label, but retailer brands that we negotiate with and then decide to launch them directly without a middleman. Without a distributor in the middle. We operate both as a retailer and distributor for them. And this is, we only we carry brands that we feel and we know that the Israeli customer is looking for. Okay. Shiran, what is the Israeli customer is looking for? This sounds like such a difficult question that you're sitting and you have to, you're looking at a product and you're saying, "Hey, can I imagine a million people buying this?" "Yes or no?" It sounds so, I'm coming in as an engineer from a very scientific background, and I need everything to be quantifiable in numbers. But you can never quantify something like this, right? First of all, we, I mean, Israeli customers, especially women, are extremely online savvy. So, we have this data. We can look for it. We know we have online competition. We see which brands they follow on Instagram. We see which brands they discuss on Facebook groups. We ask questions. We have our teams in 260 doors telling us which brands they're asking to purchase, to buy. So, we have a decent clue. But on the other hand, we're looking for newness. We're looking for innovation, which is a bit, it's a different term when we're talking about skin care or beauty. Because it's quite challenging to create newness in these fields. So, basically I would not launch a brand that no one here knows. Because I would not want to waste time or money on market education. I rather have brands that people already purchase online from abroad, or big names that everyone know. And if it's a new brand, I'd rather develop a brand myself. If it's an unknown brand, I'd rather create a brand of my own like we did already with three different ones. And then you educate the market, but you have a higher GP. You have the ability to control the materials to create them from scratch. So, I would say for your question, we're looking for brands that are very Instagram oriented, again, because Instagram is a key factor in my decision making process. And we're looking for brands, obviously, with good quality. Not necessarily expensive. Like the customers here are very price savvy. And for me, it's an agenda. We only launch brands that allow us to offer the products for the same price as country of origin. Like if I'm launching a UK brand, price would be the same if a customer would buy it when she visits London. Or if it's an American brand, same thing. And we always have competition. Like I buy my beauty products on ASOS and I have a discount code. It's aisle 17, to every Israeli girl here knows it. So, we always have competition. And sometimes, you can buy the products for a lower price. But still it's, I feel it's decent. And we were being honest and decent and we offer the goods in a good price. So, it's both pricing and portfolio, like choices that we need to make. So, it sounds like you have an awesome playground. Because you have an idea for a new brand that you want to develop, you might get an idea from some competition you say, "Well, actually, I think I can do better." "I can do it cheaper with better materials and with my own branding." And you mentioned that you've already gone through this adventure a few times. And launching this brand to 260 doors. First thing, you want to create a new brand and you want to test it to the market, Shiran, what do you do? Like walk me through this lifecycle of bringing this to fruition. Because it sounds like what you've got to play around with sounds like successfully, is something that a lot of people, I love watching Shark Tank, it sounds like that's what every Shark Tank pitch person does, right? Thinking of a brand, and you get to think through it with the team and launch it already in 260 stores. Yeah. First of all, it's a lot of fun. Skincare, beauty in general it is a playground. But I think you have to have a professional background. You know, my husband told me when we were I think 24, "Be a professional." When we were deliberating, should I take this internship. He told me, I mean, if you go for it, this is your path. Become a professional in the sense that this is like the best tip he ever gave me. And since then, I read all researchers. I actually share it with people in my workplace. Like this is my turf, beauty, industry, global, trends. So, I think first of all, you have to be a professional at what you do. Not everyone can create a beauty brand. Second thing you do, for me anyway, we were looking for the relevant trends and we create a mood board. Like we have our references, we have tons of data, obviously, in Super-Pharm. So, we're looking for the brands that tell the most. The specific products that we're looking for. It's mostly like a business administration It's things you learn in school. But in general, if I'm thinking marketing wise, I'm creating a mood board. I'm talking to a designer. I choose the right assortment. You have to be very accurate. I never develop products that we already have in our portfolio. It's always newness. And mostly, when we work on a brand or when we choose a brand, I mostly think about how does the customer feel. Like who is my customer and how does she want to feel when she purchases a product of this brand. How long does this process take from this idea that you have for a new cosmetic product, to when I see it to 260 stores? Today, you can do it in four months, five months. Sometimes, look, we have longer projects. But I feel like this is a reality today. If you look at influencers and a lot of very small niche brands that are being created from scratch now, it's not like back then when processes were way longer. You can develop with a designer, with a factory, on Instagram. You can build the brand quite quickly. There's registration and formulations. But if you work with existing formulas or you just upscale them a bit, it doesn't take long. This is the reality now. People get famous in a second and then they create their own brands in a second. And you go to sleep. The next day you wake up, you have three new brands. Especially in the beauty industry. So, we have to work fast because we have competition. Yeah, so. So, what is the hardest thing about this job? So, is it the ideation phase? Is it the competition, the analytics and understanding what's happening? I think choosing the right assortment. Making sure the customers are happy. And I think the most challenging thing is to, well, obviously, if you know what you are, you can make a lot of money. It's just knowing what the customer is looking for. For me working in Super-Pharm, I mean, I'm a 33 year old mother of three, so, I am the ideal Super-Pharm customer. For personal care, for toiletries, for diapers, for everything. But for beauty, there's a whole crowd out there of 12, 16, 18 year olds. I'm not them. And I have to sell them what you're looking for. And sometimes they're half my age or less, and I need to know what they're looking for. And this is a big challenge. This is for me is the most challenging thing. Because you don't want to be pathetic. You don't want to try and fail. And I'm only 33. It's not like I'm 60. Right? But I see my, I have a daughter, she's five and a half and she is interested in specific products. She and her friends. So, this maybe an easier age, but a 16 year old which has money and she is able to purchase whatever she wants and she's willing to spend money, for me, it's quite challenging. And I think it's relevant to all I mean, not even not only the beauty or toiletries in the streets, in every industry, also in fashion, also in general. Exactly. I'm coming to Stanford at 24. And all of my classmates are using TikTok. I have no idea what this platform is about and why people would want to look at 15 second videos. I'm starting to get it, but it's a different mentality. But so, Shiran, how do you compensate for that? Because you have the responsibility of selling to this demographic as well. And you need to be an expert on it just as much as you're an expert on the 33 year old young mothers in Israel. So, how do you go and study what do 16 year olds want and what the 22 year olds want? Well, Super-Pharm obviously, we have a lot of researchers and group. And we have agencies that get money for it. But I rather be ahead of trend. The pathetic thing is coming in the end. Because the research is always in hindsight. It's not necessarily forecasting, right? Right. I'm not on Tiktok, obviously. But I'm trying to identify trends through style sites citing and trend forecasting platforms and through Instagram. Instagram is like it's the strongest, most important tool for me. This is the key to everything. I always think if a brand is Instagramable, now, we also think about it in Tiktok. But we're trying to find additional ways. We ask questions. We notice, if it's an older crowd, we can also use Facebook groups. But for the challenging group of  Gen Z, it's a problem. I'm telling you the truth. I have a brand. One of my brands has a skin care, like a roller, a rose quartz roller, which is very big on Instagram. Well, it was for the last two years. I recently found out girls that are ten and eleven are purchasing this product. They don't need it. Okay? But it looks good on camera, so they buy it. Wow, that's fascinating. What is one thing that you learned about brands that you didn't know before you joined the Super-Pharm? What is the one insight you've gained over the past few years that you look up? I'm starting to understand what this whole brand thing is about. That you can create emotional connection to a brand quite quickly if you're accurate. And that, well, globally, business wise, I feel like big brands that I was raised on and all women in globally, all the women in the world, that we always looked at Estee Lauder, Clinique, Lancôme, basically a lot of French brands. France was like the empire of beauty. They got this insulting title of legacy brands. And they are starting to look very uncool to young ladies. And I learned that it doesn't really matter how much money you have, because, I mean, you might lose it anyway. So, it has to do with making right choices. Estee Lauder for example, two years ago they started working with, or maybe three years ago already, they took Kendall Jenner and put her in the front in order to speak to Gen Z. It didn't really help, I feel. Because they use the same products like a serum, that is nearly 500 shekels, like $100 or something, and got her to wear a red suit. Like, who wears a red suit? So, it's talking to older women again, using a younger ambassador. So, it doesn't really matter how much money you have. We have a small niche brands that support, take and make them explode because they're accurate and right. They speak to the customers of tomorrow. The customers that they are looking for now. They already have the 50, 60 year old women buy there. They don't necessarily have the 16 year old's. Right. Shiran, this was incredibly insightful. Thank you for your time and generosity. And I know you have kids in the other room. So, really, thank you for taking the time to do this. I really appreciate it. Before we leave, I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. I am impatient. This is a hard one. This is the hardest question of all. Yeah. I don't really have patience. I think, I listen. Okay. Yeah, I listen and pay attention to comments. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah. And I multitask. I'm a great believer in done is better than perfect. Since honestly not sounding like a cliche. I read Leneen and I took this, well, it's not her sentence, obviously, but I took it and this is my way of life. I'd rather finish most tasks in 90% way instead of holding back on one specific. I'm not a perfectionist, let's just say that. So, I think two very important tips are finish what you started. Even if it's not perfect, just get it over with and move to your next task. And be a professional. Choose one thing, dive in, know what you're talking about, become an expert and that's it. Shiran, toda raba. Thank you very very much. And I can't wait to share this with the world. Thank you. Bye.
