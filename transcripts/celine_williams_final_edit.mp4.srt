1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,599
Everyone being involved matters,

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,639
but if the leadership is not on board

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,679
and is not consistent

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,799
about talking about it,

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,479
living it, putting it into action,

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,800
it will not happen in the organization.

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,039
Celine Williams,

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,239
welcome to 20 Minute Leaders.

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,639
How are you?

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,839
I'm wonderful, thank you.

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,240
How are you?

12
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:46,359
I'm doing great.

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,119
Thank you very much.

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,799
I'm in Tel Aviv.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,640
And where are you right now?

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,759
I'm in Toronto, Canada.

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,679
In Toronto, Canada.

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,759
And you know,

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,279
the one good thing that may happen

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,714
through this whole crisis,

21
00:00:57,914 --> 00:00:59,038
is that I get to talk to people

22
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:00,367
from all over the world

23
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:01,839
in all sorts of weird hours.

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,039
I'm watching darkness,

25
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,360
you're watching the sunrise.

26
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:05,799
It's beautiful.

27
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,119
Celine,

28
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,192
executive coach,

29
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:09,799
founder of reVisionary,

30
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,839
vast experience

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,639
both in the entrepreneurial scene

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,959
in the tech ecosystem,

33
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,931
whether it's as a mentor,

34
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:16,463
business development,

35
00:01:16,663 --> 00:01:18,240
culture coach, you name it.

36
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:21,079
I'd love to talk about leadership

37
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,279
and about the different challenges

38
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:22,999
that people face

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,359
and how to overcome them,

40
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,839
what we can learn from the pandemic

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,839
and what you've learned over

42
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,719
the past 20 years as a coach.

43
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,879
So, why don't you start off

44
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,027
by telling me a little bit

45
00:01:31,227 --> 00:01:31,610
about yourself

46
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,892
and we'll get the ball

47
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:33,919
rolling from there.

48
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,399
Sure.

49
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,999
So, I'll tell you a little bit about

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,119
my journey, because as much

51
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,719
as I would love say,

52
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,919
I've been a coach for 20 years

53
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,720
since I came out of university,

54
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:44,039
that's not true.

55
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,919
But I've had a vast career.

56
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,399
I've done a lot of different things.

57
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,359
So, when I was actually in university,

58
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,731
I started my first business

59
00:01:56,931 --> 00:01:58,792
that I always joke was like

60
00:01:58,992 --> 00:02:00,240
the result of greed.

61
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:02,573
Basically, I didn't want to be making

62
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:03,959
seven dollars an hour

63
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,639
working in a retail store.

64
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,999
So, I started tutoring for a company

65
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,628
which I was making $25 an hour,

66
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:13,406
which when most people my age

67
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:14,439
were making seven,

68
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,639
I was like, this is great,

69
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,519
I'm rolling in money.

70
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,503
And then I found out

71
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:20,199
that they were charging students

72
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:21,959
50 or $75 an hour.

73
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,719
and I was like, hold on.

74
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,479
No, no, no, let me,

75
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,919
I'm just going to do this myself.

76
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,239
And so I started to tutor.

77
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,519
So I joke it was out of greed,

78
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,744
but it was really

79
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,729
an opportunity that I saw

80
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:36,799
that I have was I had a sort

81
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,199
of a specialty in tutoring.

82
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,100
So I was getting

83
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,865
a very specific group of kids

84
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:43,159
that were coming to me.

85
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,630
So, I was like,

86
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,319
why don't I leverage,

87
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,439
I can just do my own thing.

88
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,239
So, that's what I did.

89
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,920
So, you were talking to me about

90
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:50,719
making $25 an hour.

91
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,039
It's not about the greed.

92
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,879
It was about the opportunity

93
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,359
and about the curiosity.

94
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,239
continue the journey

95
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,280
from there, please.

96
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,560
Yeah.

97
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:59,825
So, I started my business

98
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:01,494
and then I ended up

99
00:03:01,694 --> 00:03:03,039
creating a program.

100
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,600
It was at the time,

101
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,088
Basically it's so funny

102
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:08,513
because I look back

103
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:10,639
and when I talk to entrepreneurs

104
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,361
and when I'm mentoring,

105
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:14,127
I often use this story

106
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:18,039
even though it was 20ish years ago,

107
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,394
because I created a program

108
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:23,079
with a very specific niche of students

109
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,719
in mind, in a very specific need,

110
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,959
and I became known for that program.

111
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,639
So, when I moved to Montreal,

112
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,159
I ended up taking a corporate job,

113
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,519
which is I'll get into in a second.

114
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,599
I sold the IP for that program

115
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,159
because no one is doing it, right.

116
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,839
It's like, listen,

117
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,839
it was a tutoring program.

118
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,921
It's not like I was

119
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,239
making millions of dollars.

120
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,639
It was nothing.

121
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,455
But like I sold it

122
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:45,487
to another tutoring company

123
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:48,992
because I hadn't found a specific niche

124
00:03:49,192 --> 00:03:50,121
created a solution

125
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:51,573
for a problem that they have

126
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,959
that no one had thought to do.

127
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,399
So, over the next few years,

128
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,759
this tutoring company used that for the,

129
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,119
and brought those students in there.

130
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,438
So, subconsciously, I guess,

131
00:04:01,638 --> 00:04:03,672
unconsciously, I had done this thing

132
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:04,600
that we talked about

133
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,799
with entrepreneurs all the time.

134
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,430
We talk about

135
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,666
when you're running a startup,

136
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:09,599
when you're getting into business.

137
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,439
I just kind of done it accidentally

138
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,919
and it worked.

139
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,119
So, I did that

140
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,420
during one of the summers

141
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,824
before I moved to Montreal.

142
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:20,759
Probably two summers

143
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,840
before I moved to Montreal.

144
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,519
I had a friend reach out and say,

145
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,279
hey, do you want a three month contract

146
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,311
at this company in health care

147
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:30,510
that had just gotten

148
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,759
a whole bunch of funding

149
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,535
from Health Canada

150
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:34,021
because it's socialized health.

151
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:35,999
Like we have universal health care here.

152
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,906
The government gave this company

153
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:38,799
tons of money.

154
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,706
It was this branch between,

155
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,199
it was in health informatics,

156
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,239
so between tech and health care.

157
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,783
And I was like, me,

158
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:48,159
23, 24 years old, whatever it was,

159
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,759
was like, I've never worked in an office,

160
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,559
that sounds great.

161
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,464
So, I took a three month contract

162
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:56,399
that lasted 11 years.

163
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,639
So, I was there for 11 years.

164
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,879
I did a number of different things.

165
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,719
I worked in HR for a bit.

166
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,999
I worked and changed,

167
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,959
a lot of the stuff I did

168
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,959
was people focused, right?

169
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,079
Change management,

170
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,599
I did stakeholder engagement,

171
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,919
communications.

172
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,679
I just kind of moved

173
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,720
every couple of years

174
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,962
to new areas.

175
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:15,068
Like I got a promotion

176
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:16,945
and moved to a different area,

177
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:17,839
which was great

178
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,759
for what I do now

179
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,039
because I got to touch a lot

180
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,080
of the people sides of the business.

181
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,719
Less on the tech side,

182
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,959
although I did project management,

183
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,560
which was the fun back and forth

184
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,930
between tech and business,

185
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,127
but I didn't actually do

186
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:31,039
any of the tech side,

187
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,119
but I got to be in that world.

188
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,457
So, Celine, I'm sorry.

189
00:05:35,657 --> 00:05:37,128
For somebody that's coming

190
00:05:37,328 --> 00:05:38,260
from the tech side

191
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,319
and knows practically nothing

192
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,159
about the HR side,

193
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,240
tell me a little bit about that.

194
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,880
Oh, well,

195
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,479
what I thought HR was,

196
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,359
was not what my HR experience was,

197
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,479
which is really interesting

198
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,439
in the work that I do now.

199
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,826
So, I was like really low level

200
00:05:58,026 --> 00:05:59,519
when I was doing HR.

201
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,439
It was like HR coordinator stuff,

202
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,210
very general,

203
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,931
lots of stuff on benefits.

204
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,160
Like all the like very

205
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,059
transactional side of HR

206
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:10,720
is what I was doing.

207
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,160
And the company I worked for,

208
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:13,099
truth be told,

209
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:14,941
as much as their HR partner

210
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,399
wanted to be a partner,

211
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,559
they were very transactional.

212
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,199
It was not about culture.

213
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,159
It was not really about people.

214
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,799
It was about like, you know,

215
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,920
sign the contract, get the contract done,

216
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,000
here's your benefits,

217
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:29,479
make sure everyone has pencils,

218
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,959
i,t was that kind of thing.

219
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,209
So I did not, it was,

220
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:33,279
I did not like it

221
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,787
because I, you know,

222
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:36,519
the thing that I think

223
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,199
is great about HR is,

224
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,599
and I want to acknowledge this,

225
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,559
I fully recognize the benefits

226
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,321
and compensation,

227
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:44,287
and things like that

228
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,799
are an integral part of HR.

229
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,519
A hundred percent that matters.

230
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,439
However, if HR is really about humans,

231
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,239
if it's really about people,

232
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,079
if it's really about creating a system

233
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,257
that supports and empowers

234
00:06:59,457 --> 00:07:00,339
and enables them,

235
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:01,999
then it has to be about culture

236
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,359
and it has to be about leadership

237
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,559
and it has to recognize those things.

238
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,199
And startups are

239
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,733
so much better at doing that

240
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:11,693
than sort of

241
00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:13,719
more traditional companies are.

242
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,841
And this was a company

243
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,070
that was more of a startup

244
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,677
before they got the funding

245
00:07:19,877 --> 00:07:21,679
and then got really bureaucratic.

246
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,759
So, very quickly I got out of that.

247
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,679
And I was like, this is not

248
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,479
this is not fun.

249
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,479
It's just paper pushing.

250
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,292
Is that a part of what then led

251
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:31,165
to your curiosity and passion

252
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:33,553
in regards to culture building

253
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:34,720
and leadership?

254
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,120
Yeah. It's 100%.

255
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,360
And when I left the company,

256
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,449
I'd already done training

257
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:44,439
to be an executive and business coach,

258
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,159
I very specifically done the training.

259
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,439
We went through a program

260
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,519
focused on that,

261
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,319
as opposed to something

262
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,080
like life coaching,

263
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,840
because that was not me,

264
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,215
but sort of executive business coaching

265
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,919
was definitely up my alley.

266
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,319
And in starting to work in that area

267
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,959
and looking for clients,

268
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,200
I started naturally,

269
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,720
I don't know if that's

270
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,520
the right word for it,

271
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:09,759
but I started attracting startups

272
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,919
In Toronto, in the ecosystem.

273
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,639
I won an entrepreneur award,

274
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,880
ended up in a co-working space

275
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,895
that had a lot of startups,

276
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:18,120
ended up working with a bunch of them.

277
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,360
I just kind of naturally

278
00:08:19,361 --> 00:08:20,919
it started happening.

279
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,005
And culture was a thing

280
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:23,499
that I had been talking about

281
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,351
because my experience of culture

282
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:26,280
had been so crap.

283
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,520
So, I was more talking about it

284
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,080
from a don't do these things.

285
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:30,999
Right.

286
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,919
Like you can do culture intentionally,

287
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,999
culture by design,

288
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,120
you can do culture by design.

289
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,520
Here's some ideas I have

290
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,840
of what that looks like.

291
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,120
Here's some ideas of ways

292
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,759
you can make that real.

293
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,484
And they started hiring me

294
00:08:44,684 --> 00:08:46,007
to actually implement it,

295
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:47,676
and actually work with them

296
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:48,600
at designing it.

297
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,442
And so, it was funny

298
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:50,200
because the thing

299
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:51,119
that I was passionate about,

300
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,639
because I had such a terrible experience

301
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,159
and with the note that I couldn't,

302
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,119
it took me years inside of corporate

303
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,839
to figure out what I didn't like.

304
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,719
Because I liked a lot of the people

305
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,519
that were on my team.

306
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,279
I was really lucky.

307
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,239
I had incredible leaders,

308
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,054
incredible leaders

309
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,839
that I worked directly for,

310
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,279
and wonderful teams that I worked on.

311
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,920
However,

312
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,039
I hated the experience of the company.

313
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,436
I hated the experience

314
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:15,599
of all of these other things.

315
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,227
And it was a culture thing

316
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:18,919
because they didn't really care.

317
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,799
They did say one thing, do another thing.

318
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,853
The leadership was out there

319
00:09:24,053 --> 00:09:24,871
talking about something

320
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:27,113
and then doing something totally else,

321
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:28,206
totally different

322
00:09:28,406 --> 00:09:29,519
inside the organization.

323
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,760
They'd change the,

324
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,904
my favorite example is

325
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:33,839
they were talking

326
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,759
about changing the mission,

327
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,359
something like that.

328
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,479
Mission-vision of the company.

329
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,879
They want to update it.

330
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,879
So, they got everyone in the company

331
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,719
into workshops to give their opinion.

332
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,655
And the statement that they went with

333
00:09:45,855 --> 00:09:47,210
was the statement they came in

334
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:47,946
starting with.

335
00:09:48,146 --> 00:09:49,599
Because they'd already made the decision.

336
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,519
They didn't actually care.

337
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,840
That's a terrible way to develop culture.

338
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,959
Because what you've said is,

339
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,840
we think you care about being involved,

340
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:02,719
but we don't care about your opinion.

341
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,377
So, after experiencing things

342
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:05,879
I was literally just talking about,

343
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,399
don't do these things.

344
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,000
And here's 25 examples of things

345
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,880
not to do that destroy your culture

346
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,240
once I became aware of the concept.

347
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:15,639
So, Celine before we continue,

348
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,519
because as a young entrepreneur myself,

349
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,360
that I'm very excited

350
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,803
to dive into my own venture

351
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:22,000
sooner rather than later.

352
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,400
A lot of my friends listening to this

353
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,760
are in their early stage startups,

354
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:26,920
what are some critical things

355
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,398
that we should not do

356
00:10:28,598 --> 00:10:30,039
as we're building culture,

357
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,279
whether it's intentionally

358
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,359
or unintentionally?

359
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,399
What are some really like don'ts?

360
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,960
So, I think, you know,

361
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,279
it's going to sound so basic,

362
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,239
but don't say

363
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:43,997
you're going to do something

364
00:10:44,197 --> 00:10:45,839
or don't say things are a certain way,

365
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,999
and then people have

366
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,400
a different experience of it.

367
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,959
I think that it's really easy to say,

368
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,263
if you're doing it intentionally,

369
00:10:57,463 --> 00:10:58,519
it's really easy.

370
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,219
I'm going to talk about that

371
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:00,479
and I'll do unintentional second.

372
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:00,719
Right?

373
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,839
So, by design.

374
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,719
If you're a company,

375
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,319
you're starting a business

376
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,079
and you're saying,

377
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,599
here's what matters to us,

378
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,280
and here's what we stand for,

379
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:10,039
and here's what our values are,

380
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,359
and here's whatever

381
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,079
whatever that version of it is for you,

382
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,199
and those are all wonderful things to do.

383
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,519
However, if the people in your company

384
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,039
I don't care if there are five of them

385
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,959
or 500 of them,

386
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,758
if that is not

387
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,759
their actual lived experience,

388
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,665
you are undermining the culture

389
00:11:26,865 --> 00:11:28,039
you are trying to build.

390
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,439
So, you cannot say it is one way

391
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,720
and then not have it be that way.

392
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,360
I work with large organizations right now

393
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,959
on making sure that if they're saying

394
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,799
these are their values,

395
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,559
this is the vision that they live by,

396
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,319
this is how they show up

397
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,119
at making sure going through

398
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,999
and that is the experience

399
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,159
of the vast majority of people,

400
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,559
and if it's one person's not experienced

401
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,919
it in a large company,

402
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,246
if that's not their experience

403
00:11:55,446 --> 00:11:56,399
because they don't want it to be,

404
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,306
that's very different

405
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:58,714
than this entire team

406
00:11:58,914 --> 00:12:00,439
is not operating in that way.

407
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:00,680
Right?

408
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,440
So, making sure that

409
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,760
that is aligned is really important.

410
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:05,405
I'm guessing

411
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:07,381
a classic example of that would be,

412
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:08,039
for example,

413
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,279
many companies today

414
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,439
love saying that they

415
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,640
support a bottom up innovation approach.

416
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,320
Right?

417
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:15,519
Now, the top people

418
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
of the pyramid would love

419
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,879
that the bottom layers

420
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,041
bubble up these ideas

421
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:21,553
and there is going to be people

422
00:12:21,753 --> 00:12:22,399
that listen to them

423
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,759
and they're going to get heard.

424
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,850
And then sometimes,

425
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,044
when it comes to [--],

426
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:27,639
you have an idea

427
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,208
you go to your boss

428
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:31,171
and you get the door on your face

429
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:33,007
because it's not the KPI

430
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:34,695
that you were tasked to solve

431
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:36,079
by the end of the quarter.

432
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,519
So, speak to me in Christmas, right?

433
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,583
And that obviously something

434
00:12:39,783 --> 00:12:41,799
that could very easily undermine

435
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,119
a culture in an organization.

436
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,919
Absolutely.

437
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,079
That's a great example of it.

438
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,199
Another one that I hear a lot is,

439
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,679
organizations say that they are,

440
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,199
that feedback matters to them.

441
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,719
Like whatever their version of,

442
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,166
we care about feedback,

443
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:57,199
we give feedback all around.

444
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,840
You know, we believe

445
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,960
in continuous improvement.

446
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,440
Feedback is a keep.

447
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:02,425
Agile organizations often talk about

448
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,079
feedback is really important.

449
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,959
And when you go to give feedback,

450
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,519
people don't listen to it.

451
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,639
People ignore it.

452
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,839
People have don't have

453
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,519
the tools to receive it.

454
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,462
They get defensive, whatever.

455
00:13:14,662 --> 00:13:15,599
That undermines,

456
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,359
when that becomes systemic,

457
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,039
one person doing it

458
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,239
find that person you can,

459
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,096
they can get coached through

460
00:13:22,296 --> 00:13:23,799
how to get better at receiving feedback.

461
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,479
There's lots of alternatives,

462
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,519
but when it becomes systemic,

463
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,729
you are undermining the culture

464
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:32,199
that you are purporting to be creating.

465
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,343
And so, that consistency,

466
00:13:33,543 --> 00:13:34,382
I would actually use,

467
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:35,312
the term consistency

468
00:13:35,512 --> 00:13:36,283
might be a better term

469
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,159
than what I used before,

470
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,829
but consistency inside of

471
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:40,186
what you're saying

472
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,919
and then what you're doing,

473
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,959
is probably the most toxic starting point

474
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,839
for what undermines cultures

475
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:51,519
as you are designing them.

476
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,407
And I would say that

477
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:57,359
if you're not doing culture by design,

478
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,559
you're allowing it to happen by default,

479
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,564
it's a little bit different.

480
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:01,719
Because if you're not saying

481
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,919
here's what we care about

482
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,023
as for our culture,

483
00:14:04,223 --> 00:14:06,839
here's what we care about for leadership,

484
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,959
and it's kind of a free for all

485
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,599
the problem there becomes,

486
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,639
everyone is doing their own thing

487
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,239
and you get siloed, right?

488
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,319
You get silos inside the organization.

489
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
And this happens in

490
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,719
companies of 35 people.

491
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,687
It does not have to be

492
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:26,310
a large organization

493
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,679
to have communication that is siloed.

494
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,879
And the minute communication is siloed,

495
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,039
your culture cannot thrive.

496
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,663
It cannot because

497
00:14:33,863 --> 00:14:35,639
you're not sharing information.

498
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,199
People don't know what's happening.

499
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,199
They only care about themselves.

500
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,999
It becomes

501
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,919
it's less of a first team mentality

502
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,959
and more of a protective not sharing.

503
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,279
And so it's different,

504
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,319
but it's just as toxic.

505
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,079
What has been incredibly successful

506
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,840
in building culture intentionally?

507
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,756
First and foremost, hands down,

508
00:14:58,956 --> 00:15:00,565
it's getting all the leaders

509
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:01,599
on the same page.

510
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,305
If you have one leader

511
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:04,413
who cares about culture

512
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:05,703
and everyone else is just kind of

513
00:15:05,903 --> 00:15:07,563
going along for it because they have to,

514
00:15:07,763 --> 00:15:08,599
are going along with it,

515
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,208
going along for it.

516
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:09,879
Going along with it

517
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,599
because they have to,

518
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
nothing's going to happen.

519
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:13,519
It's not going to change.

520
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,142
It might,

521
00:15:14,342 --> 00:15:15,919
while you're working with someone

522
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,239
or while it's the conversation topic,

523
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,239
people might be like,

524
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,719
yeah, let's do this thing.

525
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,760
But it doesn't filter down.

526
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:23,839
It doesn't trickle down.

527
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,559
It doesn't get to the people that are

528
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,039
going to be implementing it every day.

529
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,267
So, I when I started talking about,

530
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:30,139
and I want to be

531
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:31,439
really transparent about this,

532
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,159
when I started talking about culture,

533
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,729
I was like,

534
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:36,883
yeah, you need the leadership on board,

535
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,080
but it's not the only thing.

536
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:40,199
I have many more years

537
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,319
of experience now in this

538
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,599
and I 100% say this,

539
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,079
yes, everyone being involved matters.

540
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,664
But if the leadership is not on board

541
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:51,199
and is not consistent

542
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,280
about talking about it,

543
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,000
living it, putting it into action,

544
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,560
it will not happen in the organization.

545
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:58,479
It will not.

546
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,309
So, the most important thing is that

547
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:01,680
the leadership is actually

548
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,720
on the same page

549
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:06,145
and committed to the same things

550
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:08,039
when it comes to culture

551
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,600
and it comes to leadership.

552
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,280
And when that happens,

553
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,079
truly, and I've worked with

554
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,359
incredible organizations where

555
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,039
a new CEO came in or a new

556
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,439
for whatever reason,

557
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,879
their lens on culture was different,

558
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,839
they made the effort

559
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,760
to change the conversation

560
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:30,418
at their direct table level,

561
00:16:30,618 --> 00:16:31,839
their leadership level,

562
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,919
and within a year,

563
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,760
the culture and organization

564
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,600
had transformed.

565
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,920
Wow.

566
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,554
And we're talking like

567
00:16:39,754 --> 00:16:41,947
large organizations.

568
00:16:42,147 --> 00:16:43,920
So, it's possible,

569
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,640
even if it wasn't a conversation before

570
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,920
and I want to acknowledge that

571
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:49,450
because it's never too late

572
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,200
to start this conversation as my point.

573
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,040
It's never too late

574
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,920
to start caring about culture.

575
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,360
But it definitely the leadership table

576
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,320
has to be committed to it

577
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,480
and care about it.

578
00:17:01,481 --> 00:17:03,065
And this is what's so nice

579
00:17:03,265 --> 00:17:05,298
about startups is that,

580
00:17:05,498 --> 00:17:06,799
often the people

581
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,359
at the executive table,

582
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,759
at the leadership table are younger

583
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,600
and care about it more

584
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,629
because they're not used

585
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,153
to the way things were done

586
00:17:15,353 --> 00:17:15,839
20 years ago.

587
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,359
So, it's a great opportunity to really,

588
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,679
really change the conversation

589
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,760
and get people on board.

590
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,240
It's so much easier

591
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,840
than someone who's been an executive

592
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:27,239
for 40 years who's like,

593
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,759
well, I've always done it this way.

594
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,999
I'm going to keep doing it this way.

595
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,799
So much easier to do it with startups.

596
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,439
Wow.

597
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,159
So, what do you get most excited about

598
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,960
when you are working as a coach today?

599
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,440
What I am most excited about?

600
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,199
I am really lucky

601
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,119
to get to do what I do.

602
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,298
And, you know, I want to start,

603
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:53,552
it sounds so cheesy,

604
00:17:53,752 --> 00:17:55,079
but really I'm really lucky.

605
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,640
I love watching people

606
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,870
have a realization,

607
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,399
have a shift in their perspective.

608
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,688
Like, my company's tagline is,

609
00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:06,654
shift your perspective,

610
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:08,399
because that's the thing that

611
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,533
the people I work with always say.

612
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,680
They're like, every time I talk to you,

613
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,320
I get a shift in perspective.

614
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,840
You show me a different way

615
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,480
of thinking about things.

616
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,920
And it's not about me being right

617
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,160
and saying this is the way to do it.

618
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:21,879
It's just that little shift

619
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,159
becomes a shift in behavior,

620
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,759
becomes a shift in something else.

621
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,719
And so, I love those moments

622
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,399
where people have that shift.

623
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,519
And I think the one of the biggest

624
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,279
one of the things that

625
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,239
I'm most excited about

626
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,679
and I get to work with people

627
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,719
is shifting them.

628
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,429
I'm going to use the word shift

629
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:41,319
800 times, apparently,

630
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,195
but shifting them out

631
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,919
of black and white thinking,

632
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,799
into grey thinking, if you will.

633
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,679
I love that. That's really great.

634
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,080
Thank you.

635
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,280
And really, so much of how we think

636
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,840
about things becomes black or white.

637
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,600
You know, I don't care if you are

638
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,920
if this is your first company

639
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:01,679
you've ever founded,

640
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,079
it's in its first year.

641
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,559
You're brand new

642
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,199
to building this business.

643
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,280
You're learning.

644
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,160
I guarantee you

645
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,760
you are operating 90% of the time

646
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:13,559
from black and white thinking.

647
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,439
And if you've been doing it for 40 years,

648
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,885
you're operating 95% of the time

649
00:19:17,085 --> 00:19:18,239
from black and white thinking

650
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,519
because our brain loves certainty.

651
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,960
So, we create these structures.

652
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,307
And, you know, based on,

653
00:19:26,507 --> 00:19:30,519
I was raised in a very unique way,

654
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,999
by very unique parents,

655
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,119
under very unique circumstances.

656
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,239
And I tend not to do

657
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,719
a lot of black and white thinking

658
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,341
naturally less than most people,

659
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,901
just because of the nature

660
00:19:43,101 --> 00:19:43,999
of how I was raised.

661
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,039
And I have all the training now

662
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,519
and I've done so much work in it

663
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,319
that it's really,

664
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,279
I'm very quick to be like

665
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,240
or we could think about.

666
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,595
And people are always like that's

667
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:58,160
like just that helps a ton.

668
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,876
And I think those are things

669
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,150
that I love watching people

670
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,840
have that realization

671
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,800
that thing that they thought

672
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,580
was real and right and true

673
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,840
was just a construct in their brain.

674
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:13,759
And they get to change it

675
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,279
if they want to.

676
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,279
Celine, it's inspiring.

677
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,719
I love that thinking.

678
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,959
I'm an optimist by nature.

679
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,399
And I remember as a team leader

680
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,239
in various organizations

681
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,159
and one on the tech side,

682
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,772
the thing I hated most was when

683
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:27,839
somebody came to me and said,

684
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,519
Michael, we have a problem.

685
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,199
I always ask them to transition to,

686
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,439
Michael, we have an opportunity

687
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,119
for a solution.

688
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,199
They hated my guts for doing that

689
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,719
and annoyed the hell out of them.

690
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,669
But at the end it worked

691
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:41,119
because the whole shift in mindset

692
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,166
and understanding

693
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,759
that nothing is black and white.

694
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,220
There's always a scale

695
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,440
and you can always tilt the scale

696
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,533
and you'll never get

697
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:49,559
exactly what you want.

698
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,719
But it's somewhere there.

699
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,679
Celine, thank you for being

700
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,599
so generous with your time.

701
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,707
Before we leave, I have to ask you

702
00:20:53,907 --> 00:20:54,873
the most difficult

703
00:20:55,073 --> 00:20:56,159
and important question,

704
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,385
which is three words that you would use

705
00:20:58,585 --> 00:20:59,640
to describe yourself.

706
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,079
So, first one I always use is curious.

707
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,857
Because I annoyingly ask

708
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,199
one million questions all the time.

709
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,641
So, I would say curious

710
00:21:11,841 --> 00:21:14,120
is definitely one of them.

711
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,199
I would say I'm very earnest.

712
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,943
So, I don't love the word authentic

713
00:21:22,143 --> 00:21:23,039
all the time

714
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,959
but I'm very earnest.

715
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,239
I believe in people.

716
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,680
I believe in being who I am

717
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,760
and kind of showing up that way.

718
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,440
Also probably

719
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,840
annoyingly for people in my life.

720
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,040
But, you know, it is what it is.

721
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:39,480
And I would say that

722
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:48,440
I think I would say courageous.

723
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,519
I would say courageous.

724
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,720
One of my values is courage.

725
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:58,119
And I tend to take things on

726
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,439
with no evidence

727
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,854
that they're necessarily going to work

728
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,760
and face things as they come

729
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,639
you know, from a place of optimism,

730
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,439
much like you, right.

731
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,216
Where it's like

732
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,279
I really trust that things

733
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,359
are going to work out,

734
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,625
and so I just step into it

735
00:22:11,825 --> 00:22:12,822
and I have a lot of courage

736
00:22:13,022 --> 00:22:15,519
in the face of the unknown.

737
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:15,879
So, I think I would use courage.

738
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,239
Right.

739
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,519
Thank you very much.

740
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,359
Celine, thank you very much.

741
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,061
Stay safe and stay healthy.

742
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:24,826
And continue helping people

743
00:22:25,026 --> 00:22:26,159
become better leaders.

744
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,679
Thank you very much.

745
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,199
Thank you, Michael.

746
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,279
It was lovely to chat with you.

747
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,040
I appreciate it.
