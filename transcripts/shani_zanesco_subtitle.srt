1
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,320
Shani Zanescu, thank you so much

2
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,160
for being on my show.

3
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,120
How are you?

4
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,600
Good, thank you for having me.

5
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,080
With the huge list of remarkable people,

6
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,960
I'll try to reach up the bar, yeah.

7
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,560
I'll try, I'll try.

8
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,720
I am extremely excited

9
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,250
for this conversation.

10
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,360
Shani, besides the fact

11
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:31,960
that you're the founder

12
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,000
of Isratech Ventures,

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,600
which we'll of course, dive into,

14
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,000
I think talking about your journey

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,800
is extremely relevant and interesting.

16
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,080
Because like you mentioned

17
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,320
right before we started talking,

18
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,400
your entrance to the tech world

19
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,480
as an Israeli is not that perhaps,

20
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,120
traditional startup nation,

21
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,840
the classic story of 8200, elite unit,

22
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,560
whatever, and then going into the tech.

23
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,480
You had a multitude

24
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,200
of really fascinating positions

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,560
with embassies, with diplomats.

26
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,000
So, Shani, who are you?

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,400
And then later on, we'll dive into

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,720
what Isratech Ventures is about.

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah. Well, I always like

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,520
to start my story

31
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,460
in a town called Fort Worth, Texas.

32
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,750
Yeah. A Christian university.

33
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,720
Yeah. But beforehand,

34
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,400
I guess it all begins

35
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,200
with a dramatic day

36
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,680
that my parents told me

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,880
the worst thing that you can tell

38
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,040
to a 15 year old living in Israel,

39
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,360
surrounded with friends,

40
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,520
I grew up in Misgav,

41
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,800
which is like a kibbutz,

42
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,460
like it's really the best place to live.

43
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,680
Where we have one of the best

44
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,160
robotics team in Israel.

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,320
Yes, that's true.

46
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,240
So, it was very dramatic.

47
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,880
I thought it was the end of the world

48
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,120
for a teenager to say,

49
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
"Hey, we're moving to Fort Worth, Texas."

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,160
I had no idea what this place was.

51
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,080
And then indeed one thing led to another.

52
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,920
And I was bumped to class.

53
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,920
So, I went straight into my senior year

54
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,080
and then started applying to colleges

55
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,920
because this is what you do in the US,

56
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,320
right?

57
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,440
And I didn't really know English.

58
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,080
At the beginning

59
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,200
I didn't want to speak with everyone

60
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,480
because I was angry, right?

61
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,120
Yeah.

62
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,480
But then I didn't have a choice.

63
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,560
And the first happy thing

64
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,800
was that I realized

65
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,400
that I can get my license,

66
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,680
driving license before everyone else.

67
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,200
So, it was the first good sign.

68
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,160
And then one thing led to another.

69
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,320
And I got into Texas Christian University,

70
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,160
which is a private university.

71
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,760
And it was I mean,

72
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,240
it was such a different experience

73
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,480
than all of my other friends.

74
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,080
And I mean, it was a great experience.

75
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,360
Some of my best friends for life,

76
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,960
obviously, were my roommates

77
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,720
and yada yada.

78
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,680
And then, I had a choice,

79
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,440
about what should I do.

80
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,200
Because my parents went back to Israel.

81
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,120
We were there on a relocation.

82
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,840
So, at the age of the 17,

83
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,440
I did my first intuitive decision.

84
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,320
I didn't know

85
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,640
that it's called intuition back then.

86
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,080
And it was to decide to stay by myself

87
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,880
in Fort Worth, Texas,

88
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,040
to complete my degree.

89
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,280
Because all of my family

90
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,880
went back to Israel.

91
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,240
And I'm glad I did that.

92
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,720
I decided to also,

93
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,680
another intuitive decision was,

94
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,160
to come back to Israel

95
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,640
and still do my military service

96
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,200
even though I was 21,

97
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,640
which is old for military here.

98
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,880
So, you finished your degree in the US

99
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,600
and then you came

100
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,240
and you essentially volunteered

101
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,520
or did your military service

102
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,200
back in Israel?

103
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,120
I did my regular military service.

104
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,680
The only thing was my mind was wired

105
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,760
like when you're about

106
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,480
to graduate from college, they're like,

107
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,720
you can do whatever you want.

108
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,760
And I started sending my CV

109
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,000
to places in the military,

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,400
which no one does in Israel.

111
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,080
Like I started it.

112
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,720
And then I ended up

113
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,240
in the foreign affairs unit.

114
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,320
And then I decided

115
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,720
that I want to be an ambassador

116
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,800
and I want to connect people to Israel,

117
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,520
and I want to do all these things

118
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,240
and all that jazz.

119
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,920
What was it about the experience

120
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,020
in the foreign affairs unit

121
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,280
that made you say,

122
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,360
I want to be an ambassador

123
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,200
and I want to be a diplomat for now?

124
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,080
I think that it was something

125
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,800
that still accompanies me

126
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,560
until this very day,

127
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,560
and that is that, it just feels like

128
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,240
I'm a part of something bigger.

129
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,120
And I know,

130
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,000
I bet a lot of people say it to you,

131
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,200
but this is for me

132
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,120
the one of the most strongest motives

133
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,320
for me to do things.

134
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,040
Like I like to be a part of something

135
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,320
and over there it was a daily thing

136
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,200
that you're doing small stuff,

137
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,800
but you know the repercussions of that.

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,840
So, it's very thrilling to me.

139
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,880
And then, I also recognize

140
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,080
that it's a passion of mine

141
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,040
to connect people to Israel

142
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,200
in like a non cynical way.

143
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,280
Because everyone around me

144
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,480
was cynical about it.

145
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,560
But it's like something I recognize there.

146
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,320
So, I did the obvious thing that people

147
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,840
in the foreign affairs unit do

148
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,760
after they're done.

149
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,600
And I moved again to the Netherlands,

150
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,680
to The Hague,

151
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,080
and I was assistant defense attaché there.

152
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,160
So, I did what I wanted to do.

153
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,920
It was a great experience,

154
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,640
but it was too cold

155
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,000
so I decided to come back.

156
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But honestly, it was lonely, too.

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,440
It's lonely, to be honest.

158
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,440
And I also realized

159
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,920
that I don't want to be an ambassador.

160
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,520
I'm guessing it's not just the location

161
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,080
that is perhaps less lively

162
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,880
than the city of Tel Aviv, which is one

163
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,280
of the liveliest place in the world.

164
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,600
But it's also the fact

165
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,480
that you're alone there, right?

166
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,360
I mean, you're living

167
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,640
straight out of the army.

168
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,800
A lot of people go to university together

169
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,200
or move to Tel Aviv together.

170
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,280
And if you're going to a different place,

171
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,200
yeah, I completely understand.

172
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,880
Yeah. And everyone at the embassy

173
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,240
were couples and families.

174
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,280
And it's just like

175
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,920
you get the point of it.

176
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,200
And I was already very independent,

177
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,880
so I kind of like experienced.

178
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,400
I traveled a lot around Europe,

179
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,960
I lived in the States.

180
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,120
So, at the very young age,

181
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,360
I was already just taking the boxes

182
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,160
on a lot of things that I wanted to do.

183
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,240
Right.

184
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,640
So, I moved back to Israel.

185
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,680
And I didn't know what I was going to do

186
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,240
so, I signed up for a masters degree.

187
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,000
Right, this is what we do.

188
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,040
And then I started looking for a job

189
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,720
and it was like a culture shock.

190
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,040
It was interesting

191
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,120
because I was coming back

192
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,200
to my own country,

193
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,800
but I was still experiencing

194
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,000
all the culture shocks that I've heard

195
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,440
that other people felt.

196
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,960
Like I felt like an ulla, almost.

197
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,320
Interesting.

198
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,760
Yeah.

199
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,320
Wow.

200
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,280
Even though you served in the IDF,

201
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,440
even though you grew up in a kibbutz,

202
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,640
you felt like an ulla.

203
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,320
Kind of, yeah.

204
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,000
Because you need

205
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,040
to rebuild your life again.

206
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,200
And I had friends

207
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,040
and I'm very good

208
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,480
at keeping touch with people,

209
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,320
but there are a lot of struggles.

210
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,320
And you do have more comfortable lives

211
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,280
if you live in Europe or in the US,

212
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,320
I'm sure you're aware.

213
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,160
And you need to give up

214
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
all the comfort things

215
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,640
that are very obvious

216
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,760
when you live abroad and not in Israel.

217
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,360
So, it's even in the small things

218
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,160
and in your day to day stuff.

219
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,080
And also, I get back and I didn't know

220
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,520
what I was doing with my life.

221
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,240
And after the whole bam, bam,

222
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,920
I'm doing this and doing that,

223
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,080
and you're like,

224
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,560
"Why everyone is saying to me

225
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,160
I'm overqualified for jobs?"

226
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,280
"What does that even mean?"

227
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,800
You start realizing that you need to do

228
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,280
some work on yourself.

229
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,400
And that was for me the point.

230
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,520
So, talk to me a little bit

231
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,720
about the transition

232
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,080
from diplomacy and foreign affairs

233
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,040
to Israeli tech.

234
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,840
Because that sounds

235
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,480
like a little odd transition.

236
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,120
Especially because it sounds like

237
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,960
there was a point where you did

238
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,840
a little bit abruptly.

239
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,400
Yeah. Well, so when I got back,

240
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,600
I started working at the British Council.

241
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,400
And I started as a project manager

242
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,880
and I moved up to be

243
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,080
the head of the department.

244
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,520
And in this organization,

245
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,240
they do collaborations with the UK

246
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,880
on various of sectors.

247
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,000
And one of the sectors

248
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,120
is research and science and innovation.

249
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,320
I think that was for me,

250
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,240
like the gling gling gling,

251
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,640
when I realized that I'm a nerd.

252
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,400
Like, wow, science is amazing.

253
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,760
Technology is like mind blowing.

254
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,680
There are people here

255
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,920
who are doing amazing stuff.

256
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,320
And this whole idea of

257
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,080
continuing to promote Israel

258
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,200
through tech is there.

259
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,440
So, after three years there,

260
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,360
I also managed an innovation center.

261
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,280
And I wasn't there for a very long time.

262
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,400
But I think there,

263
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,120
it was the first time in my life

264
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,640
that I worked with entrepreneurs.

265
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,520
And you speak to a lot of entrepreneurs,

266
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,880
I'm assuming,

267
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,000
so you know that spark in their eye

268
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,840
and that passion,

269
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,240
it's something that is completely

270
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,600
like it sucks you in,

271
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,080
you want to be around with people

272
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,040
and there's no way back.

273
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,640
So, from working with ministers

274
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,600
and CEOs and high levels,

275
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,520
which was I still do that,

276
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,160
it's great,

277
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,280
but it didn't feel the same.

278
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,400
So, I left and like every good story,

279
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,320
a friend of mine

280
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,760
gave me a kick in the butt to come

281
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,280
to one of the delegation of investors

282
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,600
that wanted to be introduced

283
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,560
to some startups,

284
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,560
and it started from there.

285
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,440
And it just happened naturally.

286
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,880
I know it's not a good recipe

287
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,480
or something that people

288
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,280
might be able to follow, but for me,

289
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,440
the transition wasn't a one day

290
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,600
that I decided that I'm going to do it.

291
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,920
It wasn't a role.

292
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,200
It was a very gradual process.

293
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,200
And from meeting all the delegations

294
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,720
that come to Israel

295
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,240
and are craving meeting

296
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,920
the best people, the best technologies,

297
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,840
want to hear more about it,

298
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,040
I also started doing consulting

299
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,680
to innovation programs

300
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,240
and accelerators and hubs,

301
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,880
and all these angel investors

302
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,320
wanted me to work with them.

303
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,160
And then it really led me

304
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,880
to work with one specific investor

305
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,600
that I'm working with also today

306
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,880
that is again doing something huge,

307
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,680
that is much bigger than me.

308
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,480
So, the transition was very gradual.

309
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,640
It wasn't sudden.

310
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,680
You mentioned clearly

311
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,560
and you alluded a few times

312
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,480
to this idea that helping Israel

313
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,680
through tech and innovation,

314
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,840
because you're coming

315
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,280
from the foreign affairs segment.

316
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,840
And I'd love to dive into this

317
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,560
a little bit, because I think

318
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,680
it's really interesting.

319
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,000
A lot of people are talking about Israel

320
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
as a startup nation

321
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,080
and innovation through necessity,

322
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,640
no place for small dreams, right?

323
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,160
And I'm curious about the role

324
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,680
on the diplomatic side

325
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,320
and the foreign affairs side on Israel

326
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,440
being a startup nation.

327
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,120
So, what is the importance of that?

328
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,920
And give me a little bit of insight

329
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,000
into the back seat

330
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,240
of the diplomacy scene.

331
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,720
Wow.

332
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,720
So, I've seen it

333
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,840
in all sorts of angles.

334
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,200
So, I first saw it

335
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,240
from the defense angle, okay?

336
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,160
And there it's like it sounds weird,

337
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,560
but it's very safe.

338
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,680
Israel is like the go to place

339
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,000
for defense technologies,

340
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,040
[--].

341
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,800
Everyone wants to work with Israel,

342
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,960
even if they're not admitting it.

343
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,080
Okay?

344
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,600
And it was very interesting to me

345
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,880
because I saw how people,

346
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,520
colleagues from all around the world

347
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,880
are craving so much to work with Israel,

348
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,400
but they're afraid to do so.

349
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,240
And I think, coming from the

350
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
startups and technologies,

351
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,840
it's much more legitimate thing

352
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,320
because people are just looking

353
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,960
for solutions for XYZ,

354
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,160
and you know that they find it here.

355
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,520
And I think what's interesting for me,

356
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,960
now and always,

357
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,440
was to be in this intersection

358
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,760
of being the one who's either

359
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,760
initiating or supporting

360
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,600
or accompanying the collaborations

361
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,680
and bringing in government.

362
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,040
Because you need everything.

363
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,440
So, the government role,

364
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,960
the private money,

365
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,760
which is extremely important,

366
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,040
you can't really do anything,

367
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,240
you can have a lot of plans

368
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,520
but you need that private money,

369
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,720
and all the other players.

370
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,360
So, the private sector,

371
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,360
the public sector, some NGOs even.

372
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,600
And I think for me,

373
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,520
I was always in this intersection.

374
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,200
And when I decided to go ahead

375
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,680
on my own freelance way

376
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,120
with Isratech Venture,

377
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,920
it was really from the purpose

378
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,280
of shining this intersection

379
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,800
and making it more accessible to people.

380
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,960
With the emphasis of bringing investments

381
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,280
to all these amazing startups.

382
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,200
And for me that is the best service

383
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,840
that I can do for my country,

384
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,280
to bring in that foreign money.

385
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
So, is that really

386
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,760
what the goal of Isratech is,

387
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,800
to bring in partners across the seas

388
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,640
from different cultures

389
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
and different backgrounds

390
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,160
to support Israeli tech innovation?

391
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,040
Yeah. So, along the years,

392
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,360
I really realized

393
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,280
that I accumulated a network of,

394
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,120
I truly mean it, remarkable people

395
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,240
from all around the world.

396
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,440
And in conversations,

397
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,640
we always had this like,

398
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,320
okay, so how do we begin;

399
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,360
how do we start this collaboration;

400
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,520
and I know this investor,

401
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,760
I know this minister,

402
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,480
like it was so disorganize to me.

403
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,280
And I knew that I could just,

404
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,800
if I have my own platform, I'm like,

405
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,960
I don't owe anything to anyone, really,

406
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,160
I can just do the great connections

407
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,960
that I want to do.

408
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,640
So, to be honest,

409
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,800
it's just a platform for me

410
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,240
to play around

411
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,000
and do whatever I love,

412
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,200
which is to connect all these people

413
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,680
who are very influential

414
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,240
from all around the world,

415
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,400
and in the process support startups

416
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,680
that I truly admire and truly love

417
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,320
and want an excuse

418
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,800
to work with them to invest.

419
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,160
Yeah.

420
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,360
That sounds so so cool.

421
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,840
So, give me a little bit of background

422
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,800
about your experience right now with this.

423
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,400
So, what part of this

424
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,240
really makes you

425
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,400
really passionate about this

426
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,080
in the day to day?

427
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,280
Is it meeting the startups?

428
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,240
Is it the meeting the people

429
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,200
outside of Israel and connecting,

430
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,760
seeing the connections unfold?

431
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,600
Because I'm guessing that

432
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,160
a lot of the times the connections,

433
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,200
while they're being made

434
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,400
through Isratech Ventures,

435
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,200
they expand much further than that

436
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,280
as they go on these

437
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,880
longer term collaborations.

438
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,760
So, which part of it

439
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,120
do you get really excited about?

440
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,160
So, pre covid-19,

441
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,880
we have two parts of the [--].

442
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,720
So, covid-19 I really enjoyed,

443
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,120
I had these marathon days

444
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,880
of meeting 10 startups a day

445
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,120
like boom boom boom,

446
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,760
And sometimes it was very boring

447
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,120
and sometimes exciting,

448
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,480
I met so many people.

449
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,440
It really like it's a certain energy

450
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,520
that is can be really exhausting

451
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,640
but can really nurture you as well,

452
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,280
depends on who you are meeting.

453
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,240
And I was working

454
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,520
in a very very quick pace.

455
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,960
Nowadays, and I had all these

456
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,600
incoming delegations,

457
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,020
and come right here and come right there,

458
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,040
it was a different vibe.

459
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,200
And I just enjoyed

460
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,960
the whole complex of that.

461
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,840
Nowadays, I think what I enjoy most

462
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,720
is to really work with the companies,

463
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,600
with the startups.

464
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
So, I am on some boards

465
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,840
and working with portfolio companies

466
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,320
of the investor I'm working with.

467
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,240
And it's really interesting to me

468
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,960
to really dive in to the company.

469
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,480
And, half of the time I'm only listening

470
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,080
because I'm trying to understand

471
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,320
how I can help them

472
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,520
and not to jump and be like,

473
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,080
hey, I connect you to this and this.

474
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,800
It's like something that in Israel

475
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,680
we love to do,

476
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,880
to really soak in where they are,

477
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,760
what they need and try to help them,

478
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,160
again, by connecting them

479
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,480
to both my network

480
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,160
and anything else that they need.

481
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,440
So, I think for me,

482
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,760
it's really something

483
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,520
what I enjoy most now.

484
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,400
And it's also a time when you really

485
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,800
you kind of deepening

486
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,400
every aspect of your life.

487
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,240
So, I think for me also at work

488
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,560
and you're just everything is more calm.

489
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
So, I'm trying to enjoy it

490
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,400
because the craziness will return, right?

491
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,390
100%.

492
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,560
Shani, 20 minutes ago by very very fast.

493
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,400
And I think it's wonderful to hear about

494
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
somebody's journey

495
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,160
coming from outside of the tech world

496
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,800
and finding passion within it

497
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,520
and finding the right foothold

498
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,000
and making a really positive impact,

499
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,400
not just on entrepreneurs,

500
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,920
but also on the state of Israel

501
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
as a whole.

502
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,800
So, thank you for that.

503
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,600
But before we leave,

504
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,200
I have to ask you

505
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,880
for the most important question,

506
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,920
three words that you would use

507
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,920
to describe yourself.

508
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,520
Wow. Last week, I learned a new word

509
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,280
from a friend

510
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,400
that I think really describes me

511
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,720
and probably people already saw it

512
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,160
because you read people's energy,

513
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,120
you can't really define them in words,

514
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,680
right?

515
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,120
So, the word was vivacious.

516
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,800
Okay.

517
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,800
I didn't know this word.

518
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,560
You're learning something new.

519
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,840
And I think

520
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,440
the second word would be, a creator.

521
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,760
Okay.

522
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,080
And I think the last

523
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,240
and most important word

524
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,920
would be, heart.

525
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,200
Wholehearted, heart led,

526
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:36,040
I think it's what describes me the best.

527
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,650
I love it.

528
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,760
Shani, toda raba.

529
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Thank you very very much.

530
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,120
Best of luck with Isratech Ventures

531
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,960
and all the wonderful work

532
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,800
that you're doing.

533
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,960
And I'm very excited to share this

534
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,400
with the world.

535
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,000
Thank you.

536
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,480
Thank you so much for having me.

537
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,670
Bye Bye.

538
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,670
Bye.
