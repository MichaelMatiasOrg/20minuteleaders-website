1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,799
In Israel, the people who don't have

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,839
an immediate connection

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,359
to Jews in the diaspora

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,039
do not understand the meaning

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,150
of this connection.

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,599
Sharona Shir Zablodovsky,

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,119
how are you?

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,119
Good. How are you?

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,359
Fantastic. Fantastic.

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,119
This next 20 minutes,

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,359
there's a lot of topics to cover.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,439
The primary one and the center of them

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,759
is the Jewish diaspora

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,479
and Israeli nature.

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,440
But your work spans across

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,320
nonprofit organizations, beyond that.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,320
And I would love to start

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,560
with your journey,

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,800
and where you come from,

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,880
and how you end up

21
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,400
being such an advocate

22
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,720
and a proactive member

23
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,840
of the group that's

24
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,440
trying to work through

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,360
the complicated nature

26
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,600
of the Jewish people.

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,440
So, Sharona,

28
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,480
before we get to that complicated topic,

29
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,520
I'd love to start off

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,240
with who you are

31
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,240
going back all the way to

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,400
when you were getting your bachelors

33
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,120
and your masters.

34
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,960
So, I think that the turning point for me

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,200
was after a few years

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,800
that I worked in the Israel Film Fund,

37
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,600
and I worked in the

38
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,800
National Theatre of Habima,

39
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,000
and I had like this glamorous

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,880
positions

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,080
in very cool places.

42
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,720
And it was fun, but it wasn't my place.

43
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:41,959
And it didn't feel like the right match.

44
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,039
So, I thought to myself after graduation,

45
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,159
so, I studied this public policy

46
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,799
and it was very inspiring.

47
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,279
But I said to myself,

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,279
something has to change.

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,600
Like my track wasn't the track.

50
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:05,079
So, I just decided,

51
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,479
okay, now I'm going to act differently.

52
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,879
I didn't know what I'm going to do.

53
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,680
I didn't know what

54
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,799
I'm going to learn.

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,399
But I understood that I have to go

56
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,639
and just jump in the water

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,600
and see how it goes.

58
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,400
So, one morning in the summer,

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,520
I sat here in Tel Aviv

60
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,240
in the center of Tel Aviv

61
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,520
and drank coffee near my house,

62
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,920
and I saw an article about

63
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:38,799
the education system in Israel.

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,559
And I said to myself,

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,039
okay, I want to work in something

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,039
with impact,

67
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,199
I want to do something meaningful.

68
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,720
I'm very connected to values

69
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,120
in the nonprofit world.

70
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,960
Let's see, what can I do.

71
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,200
So, one article talked about

72
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,480
the education, and it was like a table

73
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,000
of all the organizations that work

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,640
in field of insource and outsourcing

75
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,480
for children of all ages.

76
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,920
And I saw

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,400
that there is a lot of funding

78
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,880
for this field

79
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,480
and it's very impactful.

80
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:21,680
Right.

81
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,360
And I said to myself,

82
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,120
okay, if there is so many resources,

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,560
I can find work, right?

84
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,600
Because I wanted to step and progress

85
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,360
in my experience

86
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,400
and work in the workspace.

87
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,360
And I said,

88
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,640
okay, let's call all these organizations

89
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,720
and I will find work.

90
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,760
I was very naive,

91
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,800
it's very cute, by the way.

92
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,680
But things turned differently.

93
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,120
So, I started calling all these places

94
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,080
and started checking

95
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:54,279
and trying to find work.

96
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,079
And I didn't find work.

97
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,200
And one place, by the way,

98
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,280
got back to me.

99
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,600
I went to an interview

100
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,600
and they offered me a very low salary.

101
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,240
And I said,

102
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:09,679
okay, this is not a place for me.

103
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,959
I will not take

104
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,359
the first option that I have.

105
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,759
So, time goes by.

106
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,559
I understood that

107
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,119
I think my passion is more of,

108
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,039
on formal education.

109
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,239
And so, I started checking.

110
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,720
By the way,

111
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,640
what was it about education

112
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,360
that you are so infatuated with

113
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,680
at that moment?

114
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,800
So, were you thinking about it

115
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,349
for a while?

116
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:38,080
Were you just,

117
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,520
all of a sudden,

118
00:04:38,521 --> 00:04:39,479
you were reading the article

119
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,000
and you were like,

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,760
oh, okay, there's this whole world here

121
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,920
that I've yet to explore

122
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,200
that makes a lot of sense to me?

123
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,680
What was it

124
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,840
that really attracted you to that field?

125
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,840
I think, mostly,

126
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,000
I understood that

127
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,120
there are two million kids in Israel

128
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:59,199
that goes to learn

129
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,040
in the educational system,

130
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,560
and it's when you want to affect society

131
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,360
and how it will build

132
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,800
and the future of Israel,

133
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,600
I think that it's the most powerful tool

134
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
because everybody

135
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,690
has to go to school.

136
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:16,840
Everybody.

137
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,200
It doesn't matter which sector you are.

138
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,720
So, if you want to impact,

139
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,560
two million kids,

140
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,880
I think it's very impressive.

141
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,120
Right.

142
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,600
So, I think that,

143
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:28,599
a parallel that I like to make here,

144
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,400
and I get to talk

145
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,520
to quite a few entrepreneurs

146
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,200
that are also,

147
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,320
they are describing the way

148
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,760
that they reach their idea

149
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,840
and their, eventually, company is that,

150
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,520
this is a very bottoms-up approach.

151
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,680
You're looking at what's happening.

152
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,960
Okay. So, we have two million kids.

153
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,560
What's common for these two million kids?

154
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,960
They're all going to school.

155
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,720
On the other hand,

156
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,560
I'm trying to figure out

157
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,800
how I can make a positive impact

158
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,880
on the state of Israel as a whole.

159
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,600
And given that there's two million kids

160
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,480
going to school,

161
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,400
this is a very direct way

162
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,040
of pretty much impacting

163
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,000
every single person

164
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
that's going to grow into this

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,040
greater generation

166
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,600
that's going to be in the workforce.

167
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:04,760
Right?

168
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,160
If you impact the education sphere today,

169
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,320
you're actually impacting

170
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,800
the workforce in five to 10 years.

171
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,080
And it has a big

172
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,800
butterfly effect moving forwards.

173
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,240
And for me, that makes me curious about,

174
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,480
you know, how do people

175
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,080
identify key areas

176
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,560
that they can have a positive impact.

177
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,160
And I'm thinking about that for myself

178
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,840
as I'm going to go

179
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,680
into my own ventures one day.

180
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,040
But I just want to set that aside,

181
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,680
because that's one of the things

182
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,840
that I'm truly passionate about

183
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,680
in uncovering through this show.

184
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,720
Yeah. So, I think that

185
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,760
when I realized the capacity

186
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,680
that is impacted, and as you mentioned,

187
00:06:43,681 --> 00:06:45,239
it's the future of Israel

188
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,039
at the end of the day,

189
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,520
like each country.

190
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,120
So, what I found out

191
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,280
during seeking for a work,

192
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,160
not for anything,

193
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,880
I didn't even know about

194
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,720
the existence of the

195
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,240
entrepreneurship world.

196
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
I wasn't aware of that at all.

197
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,520
Because I had this DNA of nonprofit,

198
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,800
I thought, okay, life,

199
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,240
I had like this set of beliefs

200
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,080
that life is A, B, C,

201
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,320
and that's how it goes.

202
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:20,599
But when I decided to act differently,

203
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,000
I had like different opportunities.

204
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,240
So, I started to seek for each place,

205
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,800
meet ups, places, lectures,

206
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:34,319
everything that is designed

207
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,239
or in this content.

208
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,559
So, I started going

209
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,159
and I started asking people

210
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,359
and I met people,

211
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,519
and I just wanted to work by the way.

212
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,639
I didn't have any intention to,

213
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,599
to do anything

214
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,669
that is like building

215
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:52,639
or having recreation.

216
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,959
None of that.

217
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,759
But the thing is,

218
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,599
that the more people that I came across,

219
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,919
the more I understood that the content

220
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,199
is getting out of the education ministry.

221
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,159
And that means that kids

222
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,839
are learning different values

223
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,080
in different areas in Israel,

224
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,240
which means,

225
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:17,839
if kids are brought up

226
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,120
in a more developed,

227
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,280
more wealthy surrounding,

228
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,160
they will have more opportunities.

229
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,600
And when I was growing up,

230
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,720
it wasn't like that.

231
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,880
It was public school.

232
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,920
Everybody went to the same school,

233
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,840
same values,

234
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,440
same opportunities.

235
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,640
So, you have the same cards.

236
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,400
Yeah.

237
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,160
So, in a nine million population,

238
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,080
we're not a big country.

239
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
But still it's a game changer

240
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
when you have more open opportunities

241
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,560
as a child.

242
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,200
So, how does that then translate

243
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,080
to your passion of the Jewish diaspora

244
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,240
and the Israeli people?

245
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,160
Because until now we're talking about

246
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,880
internally within the state of Israel

247
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,600
how education is impacting the kids

248
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,200
growing up in Israel.

249
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,320
How do you then become involved

250
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,520
with this whole other

251
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,800
industry or ecosystem

252
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,120
that is not necessarily

253
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,640
directly correlated with the education

254
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:16,200
within Israel?

255
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,120
No.

256
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,760
Well, by chance,

257
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,240
I got into the discourse

258
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,200
of Israel diaspora relationship.

259
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,480
I got into this amazing opportunity

260
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,400
through AJC

261
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,480
and I'm very grateful for that.

262
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:32,719
I went on a delegation

263
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,639
to DC at 2016.

264
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,000
And I always was fascinated

265
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,200
by this relationship.

266
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,920
And personally,

267
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,360
I have a family in the US,

268
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,280
but I never, it was by the way,

269
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:48,519
the first time that I was in the US,

270
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,720
and until I wasn't there

271
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,880
I didn't understood

272
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,000
how meaningful it was,

273
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,160
even though I have family here.

274
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,960
So, I think that

275
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,280
the connection

276
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:06,279
between education

277
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,999
and the Jewish diaspora,

278
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,639
Israeli diaspora relationship,

279
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,520
combines that,

280
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,199
for me now,

281
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,400
as reflecting back,

282
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,280
I think that what we need in society

283
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,960
in Israel is to learn about our history.

284
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,040
And the history of, by the way,

285
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,440
all diaspora, not only American Jews.

286
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,280
Okay?

287
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,480
Because there was a turning point.

288
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,040
Israel was established.

289
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,360
It was a race

290
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,680
to build a new country,

291
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,160
which is the wonder itself.

292
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,400
Right.

293
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,360
That's another topic.

294
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,040
And we went to different routes.

295
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,000
Different like,

296
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,959
challenges in life.

297
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,720
Because we're a majority,

298
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,439
Jewish diaspora is minority,

299
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,559
so we have a lot of things

300
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,519
that are very different.

301
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,600
But the same,

302
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:05,119
because we have same history,

303
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,799
same values,

304
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,599
we share a lot of things together.

305
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,199
So, I think that now,

306
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,440
looking back, I think,

307
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:20,040
if local leadership would embrace

308
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:26,760
the studies of the holistic situation

309
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,280
and also learning

310
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,360
about the streams in Judaism,

311
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,760
it will make us stronger

312
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,360
as a global nation.

313
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,520
And I think it will be very beneficial

314
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,000
for Israelis in general.

315
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,040
Because I think that personally,

316
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,720
Israeli people who don't have

317
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,760
an immediate connection

318
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,280
to Jews in the diaspora

319
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,960
do not understand the meaning

320
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,680
of this connection.

321
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,000
So, I love to provide

322
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:58,719
a little bit more context

323
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,159
to both my Israeli friends

324
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,639
who don't necessarily have

325
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,559
that direct connection,

326
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,680
or to my American-Jewish friends

327
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,480
would don't necessarily have

328
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,040
that connection,

329
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,200
or to anybody in the world

330
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,760
that's listening

331
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
that doesn't necessarily know

332
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,600
about this interesting situation

333
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,240
that we're caught up in.

334
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,017
So, can you give me

335
00:12:16,217 --> 00:12:17,040
a little bit of context.

336
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,920
How many Israelis are there in Israel?

337
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,600
How many Jews are there

338
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,680
outside of Israel?

339
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,560
Where are they located around the world?

340
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,640
And why aren't everybody

341
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,400
just coming into Israel?

342
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,560
Or, why is there even an issue?

343
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,480
Why is it a problem that they're there

344
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,000
and we're here?

345
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,000
Okay. So, in Israel,

346
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,880
where about seven million,

347
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,880
give or take something like that.

348
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,640
In the US, it's somewhere around,

349
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,240
as far as I know, today,

350
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,960
five million, maybe five and a half.

351
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,480
It's like, it's very similar capacity,

352
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:55,799
like Israel

353
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,359
and the North American community.

354
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,959
In general,

355
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,560
there is a small community in Russia,

356
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,720
there are in Latin America communities.

357
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,880
So, it's more of the same total.

358
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,120
I think Jews around the world

359
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,040
total minority of like 40 million

360
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,080
or something like that.

361
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,600
It's like very, very small nation.

362
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,800
I think that

363
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,479
the situation now,

364
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,199
and I'm very passionate,

365
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,000
as you mentioned about it,

366
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,480
I think that,

367
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,560
local leadership is not dealing

368
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,440
with this situation.

369
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,160
Of course, we have the covid now,

370
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:41,439
the coronavirus is like

371
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
questioning everything.

372
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,840
It's like a game changer

373
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,720
and we have to adapt to

374
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,880
and solve the problems

375
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,160
regarding health issues,

376
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,680
regarding the economics,

377
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,960
regarding everything.

378
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,640
But there is a turning point that if

379
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,160
the policy making,

380
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,000
let's say leaders will not take

381
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:14,039
the situation to their own hands here,

382
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,479
I think that it will be very, very,

383
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,559
the circumstances could

384
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,919
be very, very bad.

385
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,759
So, I'm still to understand

386
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,640
what is the issue?

387
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,600
So, you know,

388
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:29,439
on one level, yes, I think that

389
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,160
obviously Jews around the world,

390
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,360
most of them

391
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,239
are big supporters of Israel.

392
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
They are part of the miracle

393
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,520
of the nation of Israel.

394
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,080
But why is there a problem today

395
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,080
that there are

396
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,120
five and a half million Jews in the US?

397
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,520
Some are Latin America, some in Russia,

398
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:48,239
some in Israel.

399
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,680
I mean, Israel is pretty dense, right?

400
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,960
I mean, there's a lot of people here

401
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,040
crowded in the streets.

402
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,920
So, we don't necessarily have room

403
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,600
to have, you know, 17 million people

404
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,120
in Israel right now.

405
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,560
What is the issue right now?

406
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,160
And what is the absolute best vision

407
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,800
or the ideal situation that you think

408
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,720
we should strive for

409
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,200
if what we have now is not ideal?

410
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,680
I think, first of all,

411
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,560
I don't think that

412
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,960
everybody should dwell here.

413
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,200
I don't call this, like we're thinking,

414
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,840
I think that you can be Zionist

415
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,320
and live abroad wherever you like,

416
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,400
because eventually Israel is the home

417
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:30,959
spiritually and physically

418
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,400
for the Jewish nation.

419
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,600
So, it doesn't matter where you live

420
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,000
you know.

421
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,680
It's the home that

422
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,200
the Jewish people yearn for

423
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,880
like 2000 years.

424
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:44,839
So, I think that everybody

425
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,239
can leverage from the fact that

426
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,920
we have this big presence.

427
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,240
The main gap

428
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,000
is because of the streams.

429
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,120
In the last century, give or so,

430
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,640
they became a few streams in Judaism

431
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,840
which has different aspects to them.

432
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,760
And I think that's the main problem.

433
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,240
Because the different streams

434
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,442
want to go their way.

435
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,120
Like in Israel,

436
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,600
most of Israel is belonging

437
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,320
to the orthodoxy,

438
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,560
and Judaism in the diaspora

439
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:25,679
is conservative,

440
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,200
is a reform and also orthodox.

441
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,200
So, the streams there are different

442
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,800
and we are majority,

443
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,560
Jewish diaspora are minority.

444
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,640
They have different challenges in life.

445
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,800
So, we as Israeli don't know that

446
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,360
because we're used to,

447
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,520
okay, it's nothing.

448
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,000
It's a different game.

449
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,680
Of course.

450
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,159
So, I think that mainly,

451
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,559
and there is legislation now

452
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,720
and the Knesset

453
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,600
of the Ministry of Diaspora,

454
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,080
and another MK

455
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,000
that is dealing with opening

456
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,440
a setting of direct consulting

457
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:07,159
between the Knesset

458
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,960
and the Jews in the diaspora leaders.

459
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,599
And it haven't, it doesn't exist.

460
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,520
And I have to say,

461
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,680
I'm very surprised that it doesn't exist

462
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,640
until today because we belong

463
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,200
to the same nation.

464
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:24,839
Of course, that this legislation

465
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,639
is not aimed to interfere in sovereignty

466
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,319
because people who are not

467
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,919
citizens in Israel cannot vote,

468
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,439
therefore cannot decide

469
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,000
about security issues.

470
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But on matters,

471
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,840
and I think it's very, very important,

472
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,520
and by the way

473
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,040
I have to say and emphasize,

474
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,600
this is my own personal opinion

475
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,960
that it's very important

476
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,320
to have a discourse.

477
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,960
Even though you might not,

478
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,040
the streams, I refer,

479
00:17:56,041 --> 00:18:00,359
even if the streams will not agree,

480
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,239
they have to talk, they have to talk.

481
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,160
So, because there is a lack

482
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,160
of communication and lack of knowledge,

483
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,960
by the way, here and abroad,

484
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,920
and in the diaspora,

485
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,400
I think that there is like

486
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,560
misunderstanding.

487
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,280
Because how we can get along?

488
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,320
Like this gap is based on that.

489
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,680
And if we open a channel

490
00:18:24,681 --> 00:18:28,079
and accept one another, the streams,

491
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,519
it will be easier

492
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,639
to provide everybody a future

493
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,680
because we have still the same goals.

494
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,880
We still belong to the same nation,

495
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,080
even though it expresses

496
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,280
different otherwise.

497
00:18:42,281 --> 00:18:45,519
Like the streams have different,

498
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,279
like day to day,

499
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,160
they see things differently.

500
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,480
But we have seen, unfortunately,

501
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:55,960
the price.

502
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,360
The price is heavy

503
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,400
for the Jewish people

504
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,280
and the last century paid,

505
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,920
and we don't want to go back there.

506
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,360
Sharona, I have to say,

507
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,360
I think that what you're saying

508
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,040
is absolutely right.

509
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,279
I think that the miscommunication,

510
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,040
and the lack of communication,

511
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,160
or the lack of effort

512
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,200
to really understand

513
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,560
and step into the shoes of the other.

514
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,000
And obviously, we know that Israeli Jews,

515
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,215
they act a little differently

516
00:19:19,415 --> 00:19:19,760
than perhaps

517
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,840
American Jews or Latin American Jews.

518
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
Cultural reasons,

519
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,200
just like I as an Israeli act differently

520
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:26,079
from a lot of my friends

521
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,159
at Stanford that are American.

522
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,720
And we accept that.

523
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,240
And the difference is that,

524
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
that perhaps there,

525
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,560
since I'm situated there,

526
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,520
I get to explain myself a lot.

527
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:37,879
My directness and my chutzpah

528
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,840
sometimes, may come across insulting.

529
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,840
And then I have a chance to explain

530
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,880
the misunderstanding.

531
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,000
And I'm personally very involved

532
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,920
with a fund called the J-Ventures

533
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,800
with Oded Hermoni,

534
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,720
which I'm sure that, you know,

535
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,640
because one of the goals of this fund

536
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,040
is to connect the Israeli Jews

537
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,880
and the diaspora Jews.

538
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,240
And I believe that he also took part

539
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,320
in one of the programs that you did.

540
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,280
And it's been

541
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,800
a very rewarding experience

542
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,480
working with investors

543
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,880
and entrepreneurs and executives,

544
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,600
both from Israel and from Latin America

545
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,920
and Russia and the US

546
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,280
and all around the world.

547
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,680
So, I'm definitely,

548
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,480
I understand the urgency

549
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,360
of what you're saying

550
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,520
and the importance of it.

551
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,320
And I think that,

552
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,240
and I get to enjoy

553
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,000
bridging that gap on a daily basis.

554
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,800
But, Sharona, before we have to end,

555
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,440
I want to thank you

556
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,000
for being generous with your time

557
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,400
and for joining me here.

558
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:31,039
And I have to ask for three words

559
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,600
that you would use to describe yourself.

560
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,919
I think that the three words

561
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,839
that will describe me is perseverance

562
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,559
and optimism

563
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,559
and learning.

564
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,039
I think it's very important

565
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,959
for evolving and for growing.

566
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,999
I love it.

567
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,319
Sharona, thank you very much.

568
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,239
This is great.

569
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,440
Thanks for having me.

570
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:51,800
Thank you.

571
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,960
