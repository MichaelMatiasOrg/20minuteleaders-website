Rachel Efrat, thank you for being on my show. How are you? Good. Thank you for having me. It's a pleasure to be here. Good morning to you. Good night to me. You're calling from Ra'anana, right? Yes. Yes. Wonderful. Okay. Rachel, I know nothing about what we're gonna talk about which is most exciting for me because at this point, after about a hundred and something episodes, it's really exciting when I get to talk to somebody and I have no idea what they're gonna tell me. So, a little spoiler. Today you're a senior legal counsel at Lightricks. Previously a legal counsel at Gett, but you've transitioned from actually traditional law and litigation into technology law. So Efrat, take me back, Rachel. Sorry. Take me back, all the way back to when you were getting your law degree. Do you know you're going to be in tech? No, I had no idea. I graduated law school and I immediately started clerking for a judge. I thought I was going to be a litigator. In my mind, I always had this dream of opening up like my own private practice, brick and mortar shop. So I clerked for a year and then I worked at a plaintiff's law firm representing people who had been wrongfully terminated from their jobs - Not necessarily tech. Right? Unrelated. Completely unrelated. Wow. So wait Rachel. First of all, litigation. Paint me the picture. What does that entail when you say you were a litigator when you started out? So, litigators are lawyers who go to court and represent their clients in legal disputes that find their way to the courtroom. So, as a clerk, you're the judge's right hand man or woman, and you prepare all of the motions, do all of the legal research behind the scenes so that the judge - All of the objection, right? can make the proper decision. All the times that they say objection, is that what it is? Yes. I think you froze for a second. Sorry, can you just repeat the last? No. no. I was joking to ask you if that when you say to prepare all the motions, that's about saying the objection. Sure. Like in the movies. Okay. So you go from litigation and then where does the your career take you? Sure. Sure. So, what actually ended up happening, I was working at a plaintiff's firm, and then I end up moving to Israel. I met my husband in New York, and his work brought him back to Israel. I came with. I thought it would be a one year stint. It's now been five years. And I quickly realized when I landed here, that I wasn't going to do litigation in Israel. The whole Hebrew, I can get around, but litigation in Hebrew is a whole different ballgame. Right. So I started realizing okay what are my opportunities here? And a lot of the opportunities, and you kind of have to reinvent yourself which is a challenge. Like taking a step back to move forwards. Most of the opportunities for English speaking American lawyers are in tech or in the commercial space. So, I got a job working at a boutique law firm representing lots of startups. This was like my first entry into transactional work because before I had been working on writing motions, going to court, depositions. There's a lot of different things you can do in the law. I've been fortunate to enjoy everything that I've done. And I worked there for about two years and then, I just, I wanted to move in-house. It was something I thought would be fun. You get to actually, instead of representing lots of clients, you have one client. You get to know your client really well. So I actually my boss at Gett, I e-mailed her. I saw that they were looking for a legal counsel and I e-mailed her and I told her I would really love to work for you. And one thing led to another. I ended up getting hired there. I worked there for three years. Rachel, what does that mean the legal counsel within a company like Gett? And whoever doesn't know, Gett is already I believe a unicorn, right an Israel Unicorn where they provide ride-sharing services similar to Uber and Lyft across the world. Gett is focused on different areas particularly also Israel. But what does that mean to have a legal counsel within an organization like Gett? Sure. So, basically what it means as a legal counsel, you are the in-house lawyer for the company. So the company is your client. In essence, you have one client and that's the company. In practice, you still have hundreds of clients because when you're in a high growth startup, the legal teams tend to be relatively small. So, you have your hands in a lot of different places. So when you say you have a hundred clients, you mean a hundred different stakeholders within the company who need your assistance under the Gett name, but you're considering them as a hundred different clients because they have different needs. Exactly. Exactly. So, you may find yourself working with the product team on issues of regulatory compliance. Like in a ride sharing company, there's tons of regulatory needs to make sure like your pricing is compliant. You may find yourselves working with developers on the data team because GDPR, CCPA, all of a sudden you need to get all your data in place. Working with the finance team on inter-company agreements, investment rounds, supporting due diligence, your Biz Dev team on partnership agreements. So, every single stakeholder has totally different needs. Actually, this is one of the things I love about it because it really never gets boring. You have insights into so many different areas of the company, so many different people, and you get to see everyone's different perspective. But your job as legal counsel is essentially to advise the company, to support them, and to manage their legal risk and exposure. So, are you the pessimist in the group? In the startup? No because I'm serious because I'm thinking of a startup organization. Everybody's so excited. Everybody's like, "Yeah, move fast and break things" And all of a sudden, when I think of legal in this context of a startup, I think you're like the downer, the person who has to say, "No" So I wouldn't call it the pessimist, but we're not always the most popular person in the room. Right. So, there is a level of having to be comfortable being uncomfortable especially when you work in Israel where conflict is just part of the game and people always are just are so up front. So, you just have to be very clear, know your boundaries. I like to think that we're not the people who are saying no, that we're just coming from a different perspective. People are just, don't think the same way that we think. While we're also closing deals, a lot of the time we're also the same people who have to pick up the pieces when a deal goes sour or when litigation ensues, or unfortunately sometimes you go through a bankruptcy event and your legal counsel will be involved in that. So we've just, we have a different perspective. But I like to think of it as problem-solving in that we look for creative solutions. I love it. Okay. So I have so many questions already lined up in my head, but the first one, at what point does a startup need a legal counsel in-house? Because most startups, when I incorporated my company in high school with my good friend Drew, we went into Cooley and they did pro bono. They incorporated for us. At what point do we say, "Okay. Now we're big enough and we're ready to have somebody in-house to work full time with us" I think from what I've seen, generally, I don't know that the CEO says, "Oh, now I want a lawyer in-house" but usually the board requires it as a company matures, after they've reached a certain level of investment, and things like compliance become more important. If you're starting to think down the road about an exit event and you really need to have all your ducks in order. Obviously, you need a CFO and the CFO kind of comes I think before the legal counsel. And that's when it starts to get more pressing. Okay. Okay, that's fascinating. And then, tell me a little bit about the inside the organization. So you're sitting there and a lot of the times you get to work with the different stakeholders in the organization, whether it's at Gett or at Lightricks. I'm assuming that a lot of the times, the rationale that you bring to the table and your decision making or your processes, they're not always understood by your colleagues, right? And you don't necessarily always have the time to go and explain why you need everything the way that you need it. Do you find that there's a lot of tension with that? Or do people sort of give you the respect of, Okay. You know what you're doing. We're gonna trust you. I think it's a work in progress. I don't think you can expect anyone to just listen to you because I said so. So everyone who you're working with, it's a relationship. So that's another thing I really like about the job You have to be a people person. So, it's relationships that you develop over time. You're working with a lot of different people, but you're working with the same people day in and day out. So, my approach, and I'm sure you can speak with different lawyers that have different approaches is, I try to explain to them why I'm advising them in a certain way. Sometimes, they really don't care about the law. They just want like a yes or no answer. Right. They're like that's nice. Just tell me if I can do it or not. But it's also so they can understand the reasoning behind it and it's not gonna be the last question they have. So they can kind of get a sense of the direction of what's okay, what's not. And it also helps them be prepared for the next time so they have it on their radar and they can actually reach out to me if they think something is not kosher. So I think educating your teams, training them, it's helpful for everyone, and in the end of the day, yes, I have an agenda as a legal counsel, but my agenda is really for the better of the company. I'm not just doing it because Rachel feels like it. So it's really educating the team so that they realize like this is important for Lightricks. This is important for the company. Not just because my lawyer said so. That makes perfect sense. And I think that at the end, you are part of the organization, you're a part of the culture, and they need to see you as such. A lot of, it sounds to me, that almost every aspect of the startup scene has changed dramatically over the past 10, 15 years. Whether it's things transitioning from top down decisions to bottom up decisions, responsibilities, different ways of going about getting a startup off the ground. Has the legal counsel arena within a startup changed at all over the past 10, 15 years? Or is it the same methodology, same types of people? That I can't really say because I haven't been a legal counsel in-house for 15 years. No from your ... from your experience. Yeah. I would imagine so just because the industry has changed. Like the technology has changed. So the way that things work now, things change so quickly because technology is changing so quickly. And because technology is changing so quickly, the regulations are also changing a bit more quickly than they used to as well. So, the pace is just so fast, especially in a high tech company. So I think probably the people who want to go in-house and be an in-house lawyer at a tech company, particularly, need to be ready to think quickly, have super strong intuition because you will be hit with issues that you're not an expert in everything, but you have to know still how to react and when you need to seek guidance from outside counsel who are experts. 100%. I mean, one of the things that I was just thinking about in terms of the legal world is that companies have become so much more globalized over the past decade. I mean before, you had a legal counsel that were experts in the jurisdiction, let's look at Gett, for example. Legal experts that are concentrated in Israel, and transportation laws, for example. And all of a sudden you want to branch out because that's what every company is doing today. And all of a sudden you need to have expertise in those different countries. It's no longer the same expertise. You need to expand your knowledge, right? And not just within Gett, but every company that is selling globally, and today, almost every single company is selling globally. Yeah, it's a huge challenge because everyone wants to be global. That's how you make money, right? You don't make money ... in Israel. So, it's a challenge because you find yourself in a situation, and every industry is different. Like ride sharing, for example, you might have different taxi laws in New York City compared to upstate New York. And you're operating in the same state, yet the taxi rules are different. And the pricing is different. And all of these laws have to be reflected in your product and how the price appears to the end user. So, and then even negotiating that across different countries in different languages, different tax laws, it's a lot of work because you're actually seeking guidance from experts all over the world in all these different jurisdictions and you have to decide, Okay. Are we going to have bespoke product for every single jurisdiction, or do we make a global solution that will work for every single jurisdiction? It's a challenge. It's definitely a challenge, but it's exciting and it gives you the opportunity to work with people all over the world who are experts in their field which is amazing. I'm very curious. How long of an on-boarding process is it for a legal counsel? Traditionally when you enter a tech company, and I'm making a comparison as an engineer, having just, for example, onboarded into Hippo Insurance. Basically within one or two days, they expect you to already be pushing code to production. I imagine it would be a little bit longer for a legal counsel that has to really get acquainted with the company policies and legal, right? It should, but you're still hit the ground running because usually, by the time you arrive, they really need you. So, yes, you do take some time to read your terms and conditions, your privacy policy, meet with all the the relevant stakeholders to understand the different products and road map. But people are always pulling you from the side saying like, "Hey, can you review this? Hey, I have a question on this" And you quickly understand, Okay. Like these are going to be the main issues of law that I'm going to have to become an expert in because every industry is very different. Right. And before I ask about whether your colleagues and other employees in the organization understand your decision making processes. And now I'm shifting the question more towards the leadership. Does the leadership necessarily understand all the legal intricacies behind the decision making? You know I'm thinking about the CEO, senior vice president positions. These are people that are making critical decisions day in and day out, and I imagine that they're also the ones who are having the most interaction with the legal counsel as they are considering their options. How much do they generally understand the legal scene behind these different decisions? I think that they need to understand it because ultimately, these are also the people who are responsible for the company. They're directors and officers. So even more so, it's important for them to understand because if they accept risk, they're the only ones in the company who actually have authority to accept risk. So, it's your job to explain the risks. 100% The dissonance in my mind is that at the end you know you think of a startup and a fast growing company, you think Okay. You want to move quickly. you want to make decisions quickly, and you also delegate a lot of tasks to other decision making authorities and you trust them. And one of these key figures I'm guessing is the legal counsel. But at the end, this is one area in which it's imperative that the decision makers don't just rely on your statements, but they have to be able to defend them later on especially since we're talking about legal things here. Rachel, this has been so so great. I have two more questions. But first, before we end, I want to ask you for three words that you would best use to describe yourself. Okay. So I guess I'll choose words that are applied both personally and professionally. Reliable, hardworking, and up for a challenge. Reliable, hardworking, and up for a challenge. I love it. And right before we leave. Rachel, talk to me a little bit about why you're so passionate about what you're doing? Coming in very fresh into this world of legal counsel. Why now? Why in tech? You could have continued doing what you were doing before. What excites you about the work that you're doing today? I think it's a combination of three facets. I like working with people. I like problem solving. And especially in tech, it's never boring. You get exposure to the most interesting topics, whether it's machine learning, privacy issues. So, there's a cerebral part to it as well. I love it. Rachel, thank you very very much. Toda raba. Have a fantastic day and stay safe and stay healthy. This is great. You too. Thank you so much. Bye. Take care. Take care.
