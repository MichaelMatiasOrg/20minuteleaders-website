1
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,040
Raz Abramov, thank you

2
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,720
for being on my show.

3
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
How are you?

4
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,520
Thank you for having me.

5
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,360
All is well. How are you?

6
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,360
Everything is great.

7
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,200
It's so late in Tel Aviv right now.

8
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,040
Thank you for being here at this hour.

9
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,960
I'm really excited for this talk

10
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,560
and to chat with you

11
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,680
and to learn about your journey

12
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,760
both as an entrepreneur, as a VP R&D.

13
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,400
Transitioning to product from VP R&D.

14
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,760
And talking about everything.

15
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,640
From helping run the company

16
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,480
from bootstrap,

17
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,880
to moving between different customers

18
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,760
around the world.

19
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,760
I can't wait to learn as much as I can

20
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,000
over those 20 minutes.

21
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,680
But Raz, I'd like to start off.

22
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,000
Tell me a little bit about your journey.

23
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,760
How did you get started?

24
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,160
How how did you end up

25
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,440
VP R&D at EverCompliant?

26
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,560
It's a long journey indeed.

27
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,840
But that's only the beginning.

28
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,520
I've been a technologist

29
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,400
from a young age.

30
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,040
Ever since I could pick up a keyboard,

31
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,120
[--]

32
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,640
I started [--]

33
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,040
How early was that would you say?

34
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,160
Seventh grade.

35
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,680
I think my dad,

36
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,640
who's also a developer,

37
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,000
he's still until today,

38
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,970
pushed C++ book to my life, and said,

39
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,260
"Start reading."

40
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,000
So, I started reading.

41
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,760
So, basically, while a lot of people

42
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,080
were reading Harry Potter at 12.

43
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,840
You were reading a book on C++?

44
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,800
Yes. Something like that.

45
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,600
Okay. Good.

46
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,880
Just clarifying for everybody.

47
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,050
Then, throughout high school

48
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:44,250
my [--]

49
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,200
and then I joined the army to 8200 units

50
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,080
and Technology Center

51
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,360
where I did military service,

52
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,400
also did some training.

53
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,080
I guided the course that I've been to,

54
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,720
the junior soldier.

55
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,800
That was a lot of fun.

56
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,640
And after five years, I got on the list

57
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,760
and then I started freelancing, actually.

58
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,360
I want to taste

59
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,800
a little bit of everything.

60
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,720
So, that everything from software,

61
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,720
to chip designs, to mobile apps.

62
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,600
I helped a lot of people

63
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,320
making their dreams come true.

64
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,160
And then I decided

65
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,160
that I want to follow my own.

66
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,880
How long did you do freelancing for?

67
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,680
Roughly three years.

68
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,880
So, when we started EverCompliant,

69
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,640
my company,

70
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,360
I still bootstrapped.

71
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,380
So, I still did a little bit

72
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,600
of freelancing at first.

73
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,960
But then transitioned to full time

74
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,220
once we started to head off.

75
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,280
Now, I do want to delay

76
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,960
on this comment that you made.

77
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,640
You said something about helping others

78
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,840
make their dreams come true.

79
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,800
Right?

80
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,040
Elaborate a little bit about that.

81
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,520
Because it's an interesting way

82
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,600
of phrasing what you were doing

83
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,560
as a freelancer

84
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,600
and you chose to do it for three years

85
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,360
to perhaps gain perspective.

86
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,680
But what does that mean to you

87
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,880
that you are helping others

88
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,480
achieve their dreams

89
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,680
or making them come true?

90
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,880
So, as I was working

91
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,840
in fact finding clients

92
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,720
is less of probably when you have

93
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,440
the community that we have

94
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,880
in the Israeli military.

95
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,000
So, I worked towards

96
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,880
a lot of entrepreneurs

97
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,160
that have the different challenges

98
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,880
in different areas.

99
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,960
Where they have the vision,

100
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,080
they have the idea,

101
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,280
the great concept of

102
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,680
how they want to see their company.

103
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,640
And they need some guidance

104
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,480
in the technology area.

105
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,560
So, just to someone

106
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,560
that can tie it all together

107
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,120
and show them that  forward.

108
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,400
And that was a great pleasure for me

109
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,200
to work with them on these areas on.

110
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,040
Really, to see the spark in their eyes

111
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,440
when they see the finished product.

112
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,600
So, just to clarify.

113
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,520
you would come in and help these

114
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,400
entrepreneurs, founders, etc,

115
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,000
or other technology teams,

116
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,160
and you would come and help them

117
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,920
with your skill sets.

118
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,320
Come in, help them with the product,

119
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,440
bring it to fruition,

120
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,000
bring their vision on the computer.

121
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,040
And then, they would enjoy this product.

122
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,400
And then something within you said,

123
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,600
"Okay. I want to do this myself."

124
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,900
"I want to create my own company."

125
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,930
Exactly.

126
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,320
Okay. So, we're there now.

127
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,840
Tell me a little bit about EverCompliant.

128
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,120
So, we started in the garage.

129
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,240
Two coders and the CEO,

130
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,440
just looking for the [--] for customers.

131
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,600
We actually pivoted a few times,

132
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,960
polishing the idea.

133
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,360
We started the bootstrap completely

134
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,600
[--]

135
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,560
until we saw [--]

136
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:50,920
And I think that the first major milestone

137
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,560
was around a funding

138
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,450
which we raised from Cardinal Ventures,

139
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,170
[--]

140
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,600
And that happened after we landed

141
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,860
our first regular client [--]

142
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,480
[--] Yeah.

143
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,240
So, we've been working with them

144
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,560
on the products for about a year.

145
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,720
And as we raised a round A,

146
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,600
we saw that their problem

147
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,700
is really an international problem.

148
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,960
Global problem.

149
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,520
And they had a problem with merchants

150
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,640
passing the illegal activity through them

151
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,520
without them knowing.

152
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,520
That they were working with the company

153
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,880
they thought was selling shoes

154
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,760
out of [--].

155
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,400
And it turns out that they

156
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,120
have been hiding illegal activity.

157
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,910
I won't mention the specifics because,

158
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:42,320
Yeah. [--] Right.

159
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,300
But, yes. So, we develop technology

160
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,760
to help them see that.

161
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,680
Help them gain visibility

162
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,480
into those areas,

163
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,840
mainly in the e-commerce space.

164
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,960
And we saw that this problem was global.

165
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,600
So, we took our luggage

166
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,220
and went to Mexico and said,

167
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,160
"Hi. We notice a problem."

168
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,120
"And can we help you solve it?"

169
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,680
They said,

170
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,160
"You arrived at the right time."

171
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,280
"This is the problem."

172
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,600
"We've known about it."

173
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,720
"We're working on the definite solution."

174
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,800
So, hold on, hold on, Raz.

175
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,560
I want to paint the picture.

176
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,360
You have two coders and a CEO

177
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,040
out of the garage, bootstrapped,

178
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,480
just raised your series A.

179
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,800
And you're knocking on the door

180
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,200
of MasterCard and you're saying,

181
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,920
"Hey, we have this technology."

182
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,640
"Is this relevant?"

183
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,240
And they're saying,

184
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,520
"Yes, it's very relevant."

185
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,880
Right?

186
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,600
Actually, that meeting is a funny story.

187
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,080
We arrived at the meeting,

188
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,320
after meeting with

189
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,720
a potential partner in Atlanta.

190
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,040
Now, we plan to have the flight

191
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
in the previous day

192
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,320
to arrive to New York [--].

193
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,120
But it was snowed in

194
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:46,640
and the airports are closed.

195
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,000
It weren't the first time

196
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,560
that the snow hit Atlanta.

197
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,960
And so,we drove all night in shifts

198
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,960
until we arrived at the meeting on time.

199
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,240
And the rest is history.

200
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,400
Wow. Wow.

201
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,600
Okay. So, I mean, that literally

202
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,320
is like an entrepreneur movie.

203
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,600
You get in the car and driving all night.

204
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,520
Okay. So, you begin, I guess,

205
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,760
working with MasterCard and helping.

206
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,720
So, just dumb it down for me.

207
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,040
What is EverCompliant?

208
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,160
And how do you actually help

209
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,680
those that are doing online transactions?

210
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,000
Because I'm very familiar

211
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,360
with the complexity of compliance.

212
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,240
Obviously, I'm coming also

213
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,080
from the insurance space now at Hippo.

214
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,280
So, I understand compliance a little bit,

215
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,440
but not nearly enough

216
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,560
to really understand what you're doing.

217
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,280
So, our specialty is to find connections

218
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,760
between online activities

219
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,080
It's usually around commerce.

220
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,360
What we found is that, today,

221
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,440
it's very easy to set up

222
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,200
an online merchant.

223
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,040
Almost easy.

224
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,200
It takes about 10 minutes.

225
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,000
An access to your

226
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,320
favorite website building your platform.

227
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,440
And then you have a website ready to go

228
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,760
and you can start transacting.

229
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,880
And that acceleration

230
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,800
of e-merchants popping up,

231
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,040
has create a smoke screen

232
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,080
where you can hide illegal activity

233
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,000
without people detecting it.

234
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,280
And that's what we're doing

235
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,240
at EverCompliant.

236
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,880
We mop out all of the online activity.

237
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,280
Online commerce activity.

238
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,000
And by extracting data

239
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,240
from each and every website,

240
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,080
about what the website is doing.

241
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,400
And who are the owners of the websites.

242
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,360
Who registered domain,

243
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,080
or the company behind it.

244
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,240
And other details.

245
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,960
We're able to connect

246
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,560
these activities together.

247
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,440
So, when we approached our customers

248
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,600
that were banks and service providers

249
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,760
anyone who wants it, and merchants,

250
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,360
we can get their promotion portfolio

251
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,320
and connect to the seemingly

252
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,680
legitimate merchants [--].

253
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,240
So, give me a little bit of background

254
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,800
about this market.

255
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,080
Because it sounds like this is a problem

256
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,800
that is especially relevant today.

257
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,360
Maybe less so, 15 or 20 years ago

258
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,800
when building online presence

259
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,600
and gaining credibility

260
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,520
wasn't as democratized as it is today.

261
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,160
Why aren't there so many others

262
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,840
working the space?

263
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,720
Or, maybe there are.

264
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,640
I mean, because it sounds like

265
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,160
this is one of the most relevant things

266
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,680
in today's age, especially as

267
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,120
practically all of our shopping

268
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,000
is done online.

269
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,200
And covid is just accelerating e-commerce,

270
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,520
I'm sure, like crazy.

271
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,320
So, there are competitors in that area.

272
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,320
I have the utmost respect for them.

273
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,200
And we love a good competition.

274
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,280
And when we approach the market, we saw

275
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,920
it was a while ago,

276
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,600
we saw that problem

277
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,040
was ramping up [--].

278
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,440
I can see the numbers of merchants

279
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,600
rising up year after year.

280
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,240
And there was no solution in sight.

281
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,560
And then we decided to build our platform.

282
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,960
And yeah, as the area grew,

283
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,520
our market grew,

284
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,280
and the company grew as well.

285
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,480
So, how do you then,

286
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,640
as one of the founders, and as VP R&D

287
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,720
and soon we'll talk about

288
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,160
the transition to product.

289
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,360
How do you think,

290
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,080
or how much weight do you give

291
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,040
to the congestion of the space?

292
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,480
And how your other competitors

293
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,000
are approaching this?

294
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,600
Because, if there are other competitors

295
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,800
that are direct competitors,

296
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,400
I'm guessing right now

297
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,080
as you're in the hypergrowth stage

298
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,680
and you're trying to gain credibility

299
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,480
and market share,

300
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,280
what are some of the key considerations

301
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,440
that you're bringing to the table?

302
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,520
So, as an Israeli company,

303
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,720
we started from technology.

304
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,240
Of course.

305
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,280
But our competitors actually started

306
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,000
from different business aspects.

307
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,840
So, either from business analysts,

308
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,760
we built an online database

309
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,240
and [--] to customers.

310
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,400
Or different varieties of that area.

311
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,360
And when we approached with the technology

312
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,160
the solution really make things

313
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,240
much better for our customers.

314
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,160
So, in that aspect,

315
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,680
we always try to maintain

316
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,600
that technological edge

317
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,640
and think up the next thing

318
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,200
where the market is going to.

319
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,440
So, we can stay ahead of the curve.

320
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,000
And in that aspect,

321
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,080
when you're building companies,

322
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,040
then you start a path to

323
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,640
heavily invested in R&D

324
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,600
all throughout your lifecycle.

325
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,600
And I'm sure Hippo

326
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,880
still dedicating a lot of resources.

327
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,000
Doubling down. Yeah.

328
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,920
Yeah, absolutely.

329
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,440
So, it's something that's important

330
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,160
to [--],

331
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,000
especially when there's always pressure

332
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,600
to put more in marketing and sales.

333
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,080
Just being at the bottom line.

334
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,480
[--] our numbers.

335
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,600
But at the end of the day,

336
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,890
you've built up technology.

337
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,960
[--]

338
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,800
I love it. Okay.

339
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,840
So, again, going back

340
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,400
to three guys in a garage.

341
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,640
Two coders and a CEO,

342
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,760
you're approaching MasterCard

343
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,280
and all of a sudden

344
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,840
you have this huge client.

345
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,000
And this is after, you're also,

346
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,960
your main experience

347
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,280
as a freelance engineer

348
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,440
is to help small teams

349
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,480
bring their products to fruition.

350
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,320
How is this transition of going from,

351
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,840
some Israeli customers for EverCompliant,

352
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,640
all of a sudden, seeing MasterCard,

353
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,280
and working with one of the biggest

354
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,760
online transaction companies?

355
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,960
Give me a little bit of taste

356
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,000
as to what that's like.

357
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,520
So, when you're working with MasterCard,

358
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,280
you have a lot of,

359
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,360
they present you the market list.

360
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,240
They sent us over

361
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,920
to different global companies

362
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,680
and that we tested our product

363
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,560
real time with them.

364
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,600
And they saw the benefits

365
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,000
and they became

366
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,160
our first global customers.

367
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,840
And that process is really

368
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
it brings the company

369
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,000
to a different level of maturity.

370
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,920
Because when you look for productivity,

371
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,040
it's very nice, very clean.

372
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,520
The back up position is very crisp

373
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,840
and that's what we're working on.

374
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,120
But once you bring on enterprise customers

375
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,520
and you start [--].

376
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,440
There are a ton of other

377
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,160
operational compliance,

378
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,000
legal demands to meet.

379
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,680
Very long the procurement processes.

380
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,360
Things that the company has to adjust.

381
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,920
And, so, we had some money in the bank,

382
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,480
so we were able to round that up.

383
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,900
But something

384
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,080
that you have to take into account

385
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,920
when you start a B2B enterprise.

386
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,040
Were there any things that were completely

387
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,120
mind blowing or very surprising

388
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,200
in this process as you're maturing

389
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,560
the company very quickly?

390
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,280
Because I'm guessing,

391
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,360
from the moment that you're signing

392
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,200
with MasterCard,

393
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,800
pretty much it's like go time.

394
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,560
You have to reach that maturity

395
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,120
very quickly, right?

396
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,160
Yeah. It's been a meeting after meeting.

397
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,720
And long requirements

398
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,800
are showing up on our doorstep.

399
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,280
And we have to ramp up

400
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,960
our new team very quickly.

401
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,600
We have to ramp up legal compliance.

402
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,320
We have to do standardization efforts.

403
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,000
And again, as you're building

404
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,360
your technology,

405
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,280
you're still a young company,

406
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,520
it's a huge a task to take.

407
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,680
Of course.

408
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,880
And so, talk to me a little bit

409
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,640
about this transition

410
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,400
that you're doing now.

411
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,880
So, VP R&D for EverCompliant.

412
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,800
You started as a founder and VP R&D

413
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,880
and you continued until now.

414
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,960
And you mentioned that you're making

415
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,120
this very interesting transition

416
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,520
to running the product.

417
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:01,920
Yeah.

418
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,920
So, that all started

419
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,760
about two years ago.

420
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,520
So, as a younger founder,

421
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,400
you're doing pretty much

422
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,480
a little bit of everything.

423
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,240
Right.

424
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,080
So, I thought that

425
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,360
there was a place for me

426
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,600
to take really take the product

427
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,680
and the company forward.

428
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,640
And to lead in that area.

429
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,200
And that it's also been

430
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,600
very interesting for me personally.

431
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,160
And it seemed like something

432
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,120
that the company will benefit from.

433
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,750
So then, we started looking for [--]

434
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:30,480
took us about a year,

435
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,000
to find someone who is suitable

436
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,280
and [--]

437
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,120
obviously, with the company.

438
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,560
And last year, last August actually,

439
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,880
I started running the part.

440
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,520
And I have to say that

441
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,200
being technology and founder

442
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,680
and products is,

443
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,000
there had a lot of overlap between them.

444
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,920
Especially in a young company.

445
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,800
When you build a technology,

446
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,080
you always have to have a product mindset

447
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,560
to understand what's replicable

448
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,080
and what's not.

449
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,880
What's to build and not to build.

450
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,720
When to say, "no".

451
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,800
It's difficult for enterprise to say "no".

452
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,040
But it's something that

453
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,560
you have to be always take into account

454
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,600
and [--]

455
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,240
and to ramp up,

456
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,480
first of all, myself and product.

457
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,440
Because I haven't had any

458
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,040
formal training before.

459
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,400
[--]

460
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,960
and [--]

461
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,840
has been amazing for me.

462
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,280
But how do you go to an existing company

463
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,160
that you're a part of,

464
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,720
and all of a sudden

465
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,680
assume the role of running the product

466
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,640
without prior knowledge

467
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,600
of running products for companies?

468
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,720
Because essentially,

469
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,040
you're taking on the responsibility

470
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,680
of now building something

471
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,600
that needs to scale

472
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,080
and needs to service the market.

473
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,080
And I'm guessing

474
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,440
that one of the main motivations now

475
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,120
of EverCompliant

476
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,080
is to start gaining market share

477
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,920
and gaining market dominance.

478
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,200
And a lot of it is on your shoulders now

479
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,960
because you're running the product.

480
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,920
So, how do you quickly catch up

481
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,040
to that skill set?

482
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,560
So, for me, it's been a few parts.

483
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,320
First of all, I'm fortunate to know

484
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,640
a lot of very talented people

485
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,400
who are product managers.

486
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,180
And I've met with them,

487
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:07,970
learned from them,

488
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,920
and asked a lot of questions.

489
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,660
[--]

490
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,000
And I learned a lot that way.

491
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And I also had a chance to work

492
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,720
alongside top managers,

493
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,520
amazing top managers,

494
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,120
I worked with a lot of them.

495
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,720
And last but not least,

496
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,880
I've also dedicate lot of time to read

497
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,960
almost every book in existence on product

498
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,680
to really formalize the training.

499
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,080
And to ramp up my knowledge around that.

500
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,320
And I'm still learning a lot every day.

501
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,000
So, it's never ending story.

502
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,880
I'm sure. I'm sure.

503
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,440
What are the biggest challenges

504
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,520
that you and your co-founders have faced

505
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,480
over the past few years

506
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,440
in your EverCompliant journey?

507
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,920
It could be the bootstrapping part,

508
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,880
the fundraising part,

509
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,680
or the hiring part.

510
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,600
What were some of the things

511
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,960
that you faced that were like,

512
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,680
wow, this is a huge challenge

513
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,000
and I'm really excited to tackle it.

514
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,280
So, there are a lot of

515
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,480
different challenges over there,

516
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,120
I have to say.

517
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,160
But I think the main challenge we had

518
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,080
is going from local to global.

519
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,120
So, from Israel to the United States,

520
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,120
to everywhere else in the world.

521
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,440
And different geographies

522
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,160
have different regulations and mindsets

523
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,920
at different procurement policy.

524
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,200
And to learn to take all that in

525
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,000
to really build a company around this.

526
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,520
It's been an amazing journey.

527
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,120
I love it.

528
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,880
And any advice that you would give

529
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,320
to other young entrepreneurs

530
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,360
who are perhaps

531
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,520
just starting their journey?

532
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,440
Maybe they're finishing the same course

533
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,880
that you and I did.

534
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,600
And now they're transitioning out

535
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,360
to the real world and they're considering

536
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,840
starting out a company from their garage.

537
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,840
But as you both of us know,

538
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,320
it's a weird experience

539
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,920
going out from the IDF's bubble

540
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,760
to the real world

541
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,720
and doing different technology, obviously.

542
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,560
So, first of all,

543
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,440
I'll say what I always say to my employees

544
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,040
when they ask that one day

545
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,800
they want to open the startup

546
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,640
why they should do it or not,

547
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,440
I always say, "Do it."

548
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,120
And if you do that,

549
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,600
I will help you anywhere anyway I can.

550
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,400
I think it's an amazing experience.

551
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,080
So, anybody watching this,

552
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,600
if anybody needs advice,

553
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,880
Raz Abramov is here.

554
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,640
Absolutely.

555
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,250
My door and Facebook are always open.

556
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,040
I love it.

557
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,120
Okay. So now,

558
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,040
comes the most important question.

559
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,480
Why did you do it?

560
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,840
So, I understand why you transitioned

561
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,440
from freelance and you said,

562
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,720
Okay. I'm helping others

563
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,640
achieve their dreams.

564
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,160
What I'm trying to understand also

565
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,680
is why you chose to go in

566
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,760
and start a company?

567
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,200
Because you didn't choose to go

568
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,280
and work at a corporate.

569
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,880
Or experience running engineering

570
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,560
at other companies and then products.

571
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,520
You said, "I'm ready to go

572
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,320
and start my own business."

573
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,240
And that's an interesting

574
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:52,960
transition to me.

575
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,120
So, talk to me a little bit about

576
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,080
why you chose to do it

577
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,080
and what really gets you up every morning.

578
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,480
So, actually, it was a decision I made

579
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,200
when I was very young.

580
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,120
I was about 17, I think.

581
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,730
I saw the great stories

582
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:06,120
of the startups of the day.

583
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,320
And I wanted my own story to be written.

584
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,320
So, that's my main driver here.

585
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,200
And that's still driving me today.

586
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,880
So, I want to write that story.

587
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,160
I want to write that big story

588
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,200
that young people look up to and say,

589
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,480
"I want to be that person one day."

590
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,280
And how do you do that then?

591
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,160
So, does that mean that EverCompliant

592
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,440
needs to reach substantial heights?

593
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,720
Does it mean that you need

594
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,800
to be seen as somebody

595
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,640
who is like a mentor to others?

596
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,720
How do you get to the point

597
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,320
where you're writing that story?

598
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,680
So, first of all,

599
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,680
there's no "I" in company.

600
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:51,160
So, EverCompliant it's like a baby for me.

601
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,840
I've seen it from an infancy.

602
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,080
And I want to see it

603
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,400
reach as high as possible.

604
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,960
And as long as I'm breathing,

605
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,040
I will always strive

606
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,800
to move that company forward.

607
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:10,760
And yeah, I think that's it.

608
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,360
I love it

609
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,560
Raz, I want to thank you again

610
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,320
for your generosity in your time.

611
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,400
It sounds like an incredible journey.

612
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,320
I'm going to wait for the movie

613
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,360
about the meeting with MasterCard

614
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,240
and driving all night.

615
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,920
But before we leave,

616
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,840
I need three words that you would use

617
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,040
to describe yourself.

618
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,400
Whatever it takes.

619
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,080
Whatever it takes.

620
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:34,680
I love it.

621
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,200
Raz, toda raba.

622
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,400
Thank you very very much.

623
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,720
And I look forward to sharing this

624
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,120
with the world.

625
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:39,560
Thank you.
