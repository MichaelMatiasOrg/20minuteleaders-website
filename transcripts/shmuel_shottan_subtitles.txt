Shmuel, thank you so much for being with me on 20 Minute Leaders. Thanks, Michael. My pleasure. Appreciate your project. Thank you. Okay. So, we already started this interview. I forgot to hit record, but it's great because it's part of this whole informality. Shmuel, we know each other from J-Ventures, a wonderful fund that we're both at. And what I mentioned before is that I just get so inspired every time by senior insights and your motivation and your passion for helping early stage startups in and out of the fund. So just to thank you for everything that you're teaching me through that great program. And I'm really excited to learn over these 20 minutes who you are a little bit better. So, let's get right back to where we were. Shmuel, who are you? Okay. So, if I have to define myself and I think I said it before you forgot to record. I am a computer architect, that's how I define myself. You started with interview. I just want to mention. I would venture to say that while at the beginning of my career, I was thinking that I'm an introvert. Well, all engineers need to be. I'm not exactly an introvert. I'm not going to spend a lot of time. But at a certain point of my career, when I'll venture to say, was pushed into it into engineering management. I was a chip designer. I was doing some cash control errors. I was told, "Hey, take a team. Lead it. etc." And one of the things I learned and if you ask what makes me tick, I'm a product guy. Which means somebody has to use the product. And when it occurred to me subconsciously maybe that I can do it with a team. It takes a village Whatever tactic it is. Better than an individual contributor. I continued as an engineering leader. Maybe unique engineering leader and never left the technology. But never forgot that I have to trust people who are smarter than me. I'll take all a small task. But I see the big picture. You mentioned you said you were pushed into it. What does that mean? What does it mean? Paint me the picture. Take me back in time. Okay. So, long answer. How many in-directional I'll have to remember. How many pushes and then how many pops off the stock. But came to the states as a young engineer, part of an Israeli startup. One of the first companies in Israel that was called the startup. I'm talking early 80s. Wow. I am not going in who the investor was. It was all black and white back then. Right? It was, I was a chip designer, but we actually use chisels to divide carving on the rocks. Yeah, I can do jokes as good as you. But to the point of, I'm sorry, I apologize. You have the erase button. So, I came here as a young engineer. I mean, maybe another in-directional. I climb out of it as alternate hole. Technion graduate. I started to work at a large government military research institute. Okay. In Israel, you could call it Rafael. So. And the reason I joined I was third year in the Technion. They come and say, "You join." Was kind of the plan. Hey, plans, plans never happen. Kind of the plan. Okay, what I'm doing there, which had nothing to do with computers, but it was pattern recognition, video analysis, etc. We had video at that time. But yeah, it will be my thesis and then maybe PFT. Anyway, I joined the startup that was doing super many, unique super many in the early 80s. Never looked back. Came to this country kicking and screaming. Really. I mean I just got married couple of months before we bake the first son. My wife had to take a leave of absence and 38 years after it I'm still here. But now going back, I'd never forget the pops and pushes are on the stock. What does I mean push? So, I came here. I started to work as a designer for an American company, who required the Israeli startup, with colleagues of mine. And my domain was whatever, doing the cash controller. At a certain point, and I had no pretension. I didn't even know I'm staying. At a certain point. Push means, my mentor at that time, and I use the term mentor a lot because if I'll ever write a book color, I get about all the people I learned from basically said, "You should lead the team." And then it was, "We'll make you a manager." And then I was, when I say kicking and screaming again, the pushed was, "No, I just want to write test vectors to what I design." I hope I explained the push. So, somebody saw something and, And here you are after-- And he was right. Right. Okay. So, now fast forward. You've been an SVP at quite a few organizations. Huge organizations. So, talk to me a little bit about what is the role of a senior vice president of engineering? What does that even mean? What does it mean? So, huge means after the acquisitions, I mean, I have been part of three startups. All the companies that are startup, they ended in acquisition. Usually I didn't stay. At the current one I stayed. Not gonna ask why. But what does it mean? It means responsibility for delivering the product. I'm not the architect anymore, although I try to remain as technical. It means you asked, you said that at the end you lost me, but, it means re-fix, it means people, because-- you're already giving me the answer for them. This is cheating. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not defining myself. But it means people. It means a project which has a timeline, nothing words explained, etc. And it means a product. Which means working with product management, the customers, etc. to define the MVP, etc. It's all about the delivery. Right. But when I say people, I never forget that an engineering leader, and I had a term S VP, VP, etc. It's really an engineering leadership is about people. And remembering that you delegate to people who are, I hate the term because we don't do a competition, smarter than you. And you delegate to people who cover for your weaknesses. Right. Okay. But not passes all the strengths and weaknesses. But that's really the definition of the job. And between those in those three startups, depending where they invest or where and two of them almost die. Then I had to help redefine the company. By the way, when I say I, it's just a habit. But I remember that. It's never I. It's us. But. Shmuel, how many people are you leading now? About 300. I've led a thousand before. But you don't lead them directly. But Shmuel, you're defining the culture. You're defining what it means to deliver the product. How do you lead a thousand people? A thousand people? It doesn't matter if it's direct or if there is different steps of the pyramid. And then they're looking at you as the person who's defining the strategy and trajectory. Is as simple as one word, maybe two. And again, clarity. You'll have to explain what's the true north, because in order to get to a product, if it's an innovative product, there are challenges. You are going to remember that you're not gonna, So, you have to make sure you are getting into the true north. You have to help them realize. Where do you move resources and one task to another? When I say true north think how a chimpanzee or a gorilla moves in the jungle. If you watch him, you'll see he jumped from limb to limb, from tree to tree. He knows where your key is going. My job was to make sure that we know where we are going. Because at certain times at the project, you don't know where you're going. Clarity is key. What really do we need to expect? Run interference. Because especially in large company, accurate acquisitions, there is a huge. Contingency of people who are trying to help you, but they are not stakeholders. All right. Let's leave it at this. At the startup, it's easy. It's small. All the management team came together. It's much easier to do a project with 10 engineers. And that's how it started. And then grow to a hundred. Then work on a large company. And last but not least, I'm sorry if I'm preaching, No no no. Especially with engineers. They simply don't send videos, don't behave as an exec. I was told I'm not the right exec. Which is true. But apparently, I do something right. But I am not a typical, I'm not a typical exec. I don't communicate by long e-mails. I don't send long e-mails. You stand in front of them. You try to do some small coffee gatherings. Well, I can't now so I do it at Zoom. I need to change my headset because the headset is now glued to me. But back to what I was saying. They remember what you say. So, say what do you mean, mean what you say, and deliver. Because it's all about trust in my opinion. Amazing. And I think that's inspiring to hear at a time when even in small companies and I have the benefit of also seeing a lot of my friends go into all these different startups. And here in Palo Alto, there's a lot of excitement over everything that's happening. And even somebody who's in a leadership role in the tiniest startup. I mean, people especially I think my generation. I guess I think a little bit more than previous generations, enjoyed the titles and enjoy the responsibility. And it comes across also within the workforce, I think. At least from what my friends are telling me, that why is that my team leader of five sending me these crazy pitches and the slide deck to represent a simple idea. And why wouldn't they do a one on one with me? And which is exactly what you are saying here. And again, I am atypical. I mean it. I'm not saying I'm better or worse or whatever. That's my style. It worked for me. I can't tell you if it works for others. A lot of my colleagues are now corporate America. I used corporate America. I work a lot of Japan. It's a corporate worldwide which is that means that's it. And then there is a video and a Zoom to 100 people. I don't. But I don't and I admit it. It's my weakness. I'm not good at it. I am much better at one on one. The other thing to remember and again, when I learned it, and that was my failure at the beginning, when I learned it things started to work. Check the ego at the door. Check the ego at the door. There was a period, I would say, in the late 80s, mid 90s. That I was thinking I'm the smartest guy walking the planet. Because I can design supercomputers, whatever. And credit to friends. Credit to my wife for the two kids. Credit to who told me that, Okay. Well, about to make you a raise. My shit does stink. And that was quiet and education. And I realized I have an ego. Well, all successful people have egos. If you don't learn to check them at the door. Some humility. You're not gonna be successful. I mean, others are. But it didn't work for me. Shmuel, and it goes hand-in-hand with what you told me right before we started. Which was you look at millennials who are coming in as engineers and you realize two pretty contradicting things yet complimentary things. Right? Okay. So, let me start at the high level. So, they were born with computers. I wasn't. I never saw a computer until my third year at the Technion. Okay. It shows my age. But I told you that I came here in the early 80s. I was getting my dad, Billy, and I had some big simulation, RF simulation in Fortrun. And guess what? The Technion had that time a 37168. And I had to program it on punch cards and go and submit the job. And learn stuff like job control language. And one of my colleagues Sonny said, "Why don't you have an accountant TSO?" And I go, "What's TSO?" "Oh, it's a time-sharing option." "Good. How do I get it?" "Oh, you'll have to study computer science." So basically, I had computer science and never looked back. But now to the point. So, I didn't grow up with computers, but I was lucky, Most of my professional fun, I almost say career and I hate that term, but call it career, was in the 80s and the 90s. And as far as I'm concerned, that's the decade where computer architecture was defined. And it gave me a foundation that I still use because I was doing cash controllers and I was a designer on a risk processors and their operating system was at that time Unix System V and etc, etc. I became a much better software person, system person, because I understood operating systems to adapt that only a designer of processors could understand. Now I say, Okay, that's the advantage. And that's what I use now to obstruct stuff at a higher level. But when I say that your generation is much better than me and I envy you, I struggle with the simplicity where you guys take micro services and combine it to Google analytics and whatever and blah, blah, blah, blah. I don't say my kid can write in python. I struggled with it. I mean, but at a certain point I realized that I can help because I can understand stuff that they don't. Because it's so natural. So, the foundation of how the processor works and how the operating system works, and I don't care is it virtualize or containerize, or in the cloud still gives me an advantage. I hope I answer why I have both an advantage and a disadvantage. 100%, 100% I'm a dinosaur. But I'm lucky that dinosaur, Sorry, but I'm lucky that my professional learning was at the decade that processors took a giant leap. Definitely. I think one of the things that I grew up with in my house, which was also, I come from a house where I have quite a strong tech presence and great mentorship. And one of the things that I was always taught from very young is first to get the foundation. Get to really understand the foundations. Learn the advanced mathematics, understand how things are happening, and then you'll be able to apply these things at an abstract later on whatever technologies. And what I do see and I agree with you is that a lot of a lot of engineers today, they jump straight into Python and JavaScript and today it's all commoditize. It's very easy to go and write website or run an application. It's much harder to do the complex and really cool stuff because that's where the foundation kicks in. So, I completely agree. Shmuel, what are you so excited about now with working with early stage startups? So, you've been with startups yourself as an executive, but now you're also helping invest and advise startups. So, talk to me a little bit about this this interest of yours that is over the past decade or so. So, working with startups again, mostly advisory role. That means on demand. Nobody wants your advice unless they have a need. So, it goes everywhere from, Hey, can you look at this problem and use your brain to tell me? I mean, most of advice means, put it for me, [--], doing the same thing and expecting different results. The definition of lunacy. A lot of time it's about sharing. I hate to advice. I don't give advice. It's basically wrong. But trying to use example and say, here is what I have learned. That's what the business side, is the what the way I help. On the technology. Only when I asked to do a deep dive. We talked about the foundation. And yeah, I agree with you and thanks for sharing with me. I mean I didn't even know I wanna do that I believe. I started to physics and math and whatever, but credit to the Technion I think still now. But definitely at that time, the foundation is much stronger than, Hey, here is a quarter and we'll teach you how to write JavaScript. And nothing against it, again, I envy those guys. But at the end the really cool stuff is the foundation. The cool stuff is the foundation. And that's what I'm trying to help with. And that's not one semester of learning how to do JavaScript. Of course. Shmuel, we're almost out of time. I don't know why I called it 20-minute leaders. I could have called it 30-minute leaders. And I would have one 10 minutes more with every person. Stay on time. I do have to ask you my last question. Three words that you would use to describe yourself. Okay. It's the hardest one. Let's speak from 10. So, Direct. Although I am American now. So, I took American in business. But that DNA has never. Innovative. Which is trying to, um. Passionate. I was told sometimes, "Relax, okay." The passion will never disappear. Humble is my word for you Shmuel. It's extraordinary. All the things that you've done and you're still doing yet you're here talking with so much humility about everything. And it really resonates. So, thank you for the inspiration and thank you for teaching me so much through working together at J-Ventures. It's really fantastic. And thank you. That's it. Thank you, Michael. Thanks for what you're doing. Take care.
