1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,559
I love being an engineer.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,666
It's Sherlock Holmes

3
00:00:03,866 --> 00:00:06,679
and being a writer at the same time,

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,599
it's like doing stuff with your hands

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,000
and creating stuff and seeing it work.

6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,799
Gil Tayar,

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,799
thank you for joining me.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,239
How are you?

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,479
Good morning.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,399
Good.

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,319
Very happy to be here.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,719
I am very, very happy to be here.

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,399
We've known each other

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,039
for quite some time.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,962
You've been a very important part

16
00:00:48,162 --> 00:00:49,359
of my personal journey,

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,359
both as a mentor and judge throughout

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,274
the different hackathons

19
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:54,959
that I organized.

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,759
But more importantly,

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,359
you've introduced me

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,870
to the whole world

23
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,069
of developer relations and advocacy

24
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,599
for a great engineering and great coding.

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,479
And I've gained a lot of inspiration

26
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,959
seeing how much you enjoy

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,439
the work that you're doing.

28
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,439
And I speak to a lot of people

29
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,079
and I know a lot of engineers,

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,079
I don't think I've yet to meet somebody

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,444
who is as excited and enjoys their work

32
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:23,599
as much as you enjoy it.

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:23,999
Thank you.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,440
So, it's really heartwarming.

35
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,720
Also, thank you for,

36
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:28,639
for sharing that passion.

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,879
And I'd love to focus these 20 minutes

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,439
both on that passion,

39
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,479
but more importantly,

40
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,319
on the world of engineering

41
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,959
and knowledge sharing.

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,559
Now, just for context,

43
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,879
I know that there's thought leaders

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,959
in a lot of industries, right?

45
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,959
There's thought leaders in philosophy,

46
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,680
thought leaders in economics.

47
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:47,399
But you've introduced me to the world

48
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,600
of those thought leaders,

49
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,188
also in engineering

50
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:52,159
and in good coding habits,

51
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,359
good engineering styles.

52
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,559
And that's what I'd love

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,679
to allude to later on.

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,519
But first, Gil, take me back.

55
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,147
Who are you and how do you become

56
00:01:59,148 --> 00:02:02,000
an engineer yourself?

57
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,959
First of all, I'm like,

58
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,390
I think the first wave of developers

59
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,199
that wanted to be developers

60
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,960
in Israel and probably in the world.

61
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:15,062
I started at the age of 13,

62
00:02:15,262 --> 00:02:19,919
and we're talking '84, '83.

63
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,959
So, I was the dawn of the PCs.

64
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,599
There weren't any PCs

65
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,519
basically before that.

66
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,119
It was all mainframes and minicomputers.

67
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,599
At the age of 13,

68
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,279
I got a ZX81

69
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,359
from the bar mitzvah.

70
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,759
I'm not even going to pretend

71
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,319
that I know what it is.

72
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,319
It's like this little computer

73
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,919
with chiclet keyboard

74
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,639
and it had one K of ram,

75
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,599
not one megabyte,

76
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,382
not one gigabyte,

77
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:54,639
and that one K.

78
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,712
And you could write

79
00:02:55,912 --> 00:02:57,425
a little basic programs

80
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,399
and you connect it to your TV.

81
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,370
There weren't any monitor then.

82
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,839
And you stored your programs

83
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,959
on a tape recorder.

84
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,519
That's the way it was.

85
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,479
And I learned basic and I loved it

86
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,359
and I upgraded to 16k ram and everything,

87
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,639
and decided this is what

88
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,879
I want to do for the rest of my life.

89
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,199
I got an Apple II afterwards.

90
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,949
Anyway, long story short,

91
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:26,527
I ended up in Mamram,

92
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:31,479
it was the big computer unit

93
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,199
in the Israeli Defense Force.

94
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,960
It still is.

95
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,210
Very similar to 8200 [--].

96
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,800
And back then, much much more known.

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,079
I did the whole training nine months

98
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,119
of computer programming course

99
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,438
and they wanted,

100
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:55,132
and this is part of the integral journey,

101
00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:56,959
in a sense it's the start of it,

102
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,319
and they wanted me to stay

103
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,159
as a trainer for computers

104
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,279
for the soldiers.

105
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,327
And I said, "Yes."

106
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:05,837
And just to understand,

107
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:06,920
I was like this shy

108
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,039
and not very talkative person.

109
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,393
But what I found out was that

110
00:04:11,593 --> 00:04:15,839
once I go up on a stage, I transform.

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,239
I transform into this like,

112
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,119
the charismatic, talkative,

113
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,039
funny and everything speaker.

114
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,258
And, you know, when I go back down

115
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,142
out of the stage,

116
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:31,520
I go back to being shy.

117
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,239
Fascinating.

118
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,959
Why is that?

119
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,250
Obviously, slowly

120
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,468
when I went back out on stage,

121
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:40,922
I continued being that

122
00:04:41,122 --> 00:04:42,119
talkative and funny as a person.

123
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,600
That's the Gil that I know.

124
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,919
Exactly.

125
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,138
So, in a way,

126
00:04:47,338 --> 00:04:50,048
that was the start of changing myself

127
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,093
and being more confident with myself.

128
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,665
And talking in front of an audience

129
00:04:56,865 --> 00:04:58,399
if you can do it,

130
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,457
it gives you that confidence

131
00:05:00,657 --> 00:05:02,970
because you go and you speak

132
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,640
and people look at you

133
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,879
and they clap.

134
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,067
And it's an immense,

135
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,999
it gives you a lot of confidence.

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,799
A lot of confidence.

137
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,399
100%.

138
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,238
So, your dev relations journey

139
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:20,973
starts off back in Mamram

140
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:22,853
when you're going in your teaching

141
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:25,580
and you're training the next

142
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,559
cohort of engineers in the Army.

143
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,159
But you continue doing that

144
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,399
throughout your entire career, right?

145
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,839
And until today, you still go to

146
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,279
to many conferences every year.

147
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,959
You go on stages.

148
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,639
Now, you do it over Zoom obviously.

149
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,122
But besides that,

150
00:05:41,322 --> 00:05:43,039
you still chose to be

151
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,082
a proper engineer.

152
00:05:44,282 --> 00:05:45,919
A senior architect, right,

153
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,599
in various startups and companies.

154
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,119
So, first of all, let's focus on that.

155
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,799
Why be a senior architect?

156
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,639
What is it about being an engineer

157
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,399
that excites you that you said,

158
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,269
okay, I want to continue

159
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,919
being an engineer

160
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,839
because a lot of people that I know

161
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,704
at some point they said,

162
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,039
yeah, I had fun being an engineer,

163
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,829
now I want to start managing teams

164
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:07,199
and I want to to go into the more

165
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,399
managerial scene.

166
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,219
But you decided that you're

167
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:12,068
still want to be hands on

168
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:13,519
and be an active part

169
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,000
of the engineering part of the company,

170
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:16,240
right?

171
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,960
Yes.

172
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,959
There's this tension,

173
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,040
once you get good enough,

174
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,640
the company wants you to,

175
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,199
you know, go up the ladder.

176
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,199
And back then there was only one ladder.

177
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,657
You become a team leader,

178
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:34,319
and then, you know, a director

179
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,279
and then a VP R&D.

180
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,559
And that's it.

181
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,599
And I tried that.

182
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,572
And I find that

183
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:46,484
I didn't like managing people.

184
00:06:46,684 --> 00:06:49,031
Back then, I didn't like

185
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:51,083
being the one responsible

186
00:06:51,283 --> 00:06:53,639
for what they were writing.

187
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,356
And I decided,

188
00:06:56,556 --> 00:07:00,479
okay, everybody wants me to be whatever

189
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,639
but that's not what I want.

190
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,117
I want to code, I'm a farmer.

191
00:07:05,317 --> 00:07:06,775
I'm not you know,

192
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:08,919
I want to till the soil.

193
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,520
I want to smell the leaves

194
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,279
and figure out what's right for them.

195
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,519
And that is what I want.

196
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,639
And that is what I wanted.

197
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,799
And obviously, being a good engineer,

198
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,780
I kept being pulled up

199
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,557
and my career was like a seesaw,

200
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:25,819
like being pulled up

201
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:27,039
to managerial position

202
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,067
and then say,

203
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:30,120
"No. No, I don't want that."

204
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,439
After a while,

205
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,039
I understood that,

206
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,599
I'm not going to do that anymore.

207
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,638
And whenever people say that,

208
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:38,739
"You want to be a team leader?"

209
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:39,719
I said, "Just no."

210
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,319
I learned to say no.

211
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,799
And I love being an engineer.

212
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,906
It's Sherlock Holmes

213
00:07:45,106 --> 00:07:47,919
and being a writer at the same time.

214
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,880
It's like doing stuff with your hands

215
00:07:50,881 --> 00:07:53,719
and creating stuff and seeing it work

216
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,159
and not managing the people that do that.

217
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,079
And I'm not disparaging.

218
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,439
I mean, we need both kinds of people.

219
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,559
We need managers.

220
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,039
We need software developers.

221
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,544
But you can have a career

222
00:08:07,744 --> 00:08:09,117
that goes the managerial way

223
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:10,440
that forced to managerial.

224
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:12,039
But today, it's called

225
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,359
an individual contributor, I think.

226
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,159
You can have a career that goes up

227
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,299
the more professional technical ladder

228
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:24,639
and the salaries are almost

229
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,399
like 10%, almost as high.

230
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,399
So, don't worry about your salary.

231
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,079
It will be high,

232
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,159
especially if you're a good,

233
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,959
I mean, a good software engineer,

234
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,246
a great software engineer

235
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,719
is worth their weight in gold.

236
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,599
So, if you want to do that,

237
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,399
please continue.

238
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,000
100%.

239
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,818
Just for that, you caught me by surprise

240
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:45,887
as I was going through my own journey

241
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:47,759
within the army in 8200.

242
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,456
One of the things that,

243
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:50,982
that was very interesting

244
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:52,519
for us as soldiers was that,

245
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,564
people that are professional

246
00:08:54,764 --> 00:08:56,279
and they're staying in the army,

247
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:58,727
let's say, for five or six years,

248
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:00,203
they're still engineers,

249
00:09:00,403 --> 00:09:01,479
they're still hands on,

250
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,456
they make more money

251
00:09:02,656 --> 00:09:04,126
than somebody who is an officer

252
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:06,519
and who's leading a team of people.

253
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,519
And it was and, you know,

254
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,502
it was a big dissonance,

255
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:10,332
because especially in the army

256
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:12,479
where you're in a lot of places,

257
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,759
your rank identifies your credibility

258
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,399
and sort of your paycheck.

259
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Here you have a unit

260
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,999
that is one of the leading units,

261
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,479
in the IDF and probably in the world

262
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,000
in terms of engineering, and it says,

263
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:24,799
Oh, just FYI,

264
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,639
if you're a professional

265
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,399
and you're really, really good,

266
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,359
you're going to make even more

267
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:30,319
than the managers.

268
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,639
Which is very unorthodox.

269
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,959
And it's very interesting.

270
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,759
And I'd love to hear your take,

271
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,540
because a lot of the people

272
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,599
that are watching this are not engineers.

273
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,159
And I'm a huge advocate

274
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,879
for studying computer science.

275
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,799
I'm now studying it hands on.

276
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,918
While I may not be

277
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,184
the most passionate guy in the room

278
00:09:47,384 --> 00:09:48,599
about computer science,

279
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,896
I am deeply passionate

280
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:51,287
about problem solving

281
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:53,159
and the ability to problem solve

282
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,319
using the skills that we're gaining.

283
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,879
So, I'd love to hear from you.

284
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,858
What is so attractive to you

285
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:00,199
about engineering?

286
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,813
And perhaps maybe, demystify

287
00:10:03,013 --> 00:10:05,472
some of the scary notions

288
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,119
behind what you might be doing

289
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,520
on a day to day basis.

290
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,239
There are two kinds of developers.

291
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,679
That's how I think about it.

292
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,680
The developers that think that

293
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,639
software development is an engineering

294
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,809
and the people that think that

295
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:25,279
software development is a craft.

296
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,119
You can immediately spot them.

297
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,095
The engineers think that

298
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:32,680
we can't get too perfect.

299
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,399
They love type systems,

300
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,519
you know,

301
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,564
because they believe

302
00:10:36,764 --> 00:10:38,039
that if you get the types right,

303
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,959
everything will fall into place.

304
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,679
And then there are the craftsmen.

305
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,079
They understand that nothing's perfect.

306
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,719
And software development is like

307
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,079
it's like voting in the US.

308
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,319
You can never reach 100%

309
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,879
for some reason.

310
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,520
It's always like a tangent to perfect.

311
00:10:58,521 --> 00:11:00,519
And you can strive to that,

312
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,479
but it's never that.

313
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,048
And you always have to mangle it

314
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:05,098
and fix it and deal with

315
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,639
technical problems.

316
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,400
I'm a craftsman.

317
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,760
And as a craftsman I love to create.

318
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:12,935
I don't see myself

319
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:17,148
as really different from a carpenter

320
00:11:17,348 --> 00:11:21,878
or from someone who makes dresses

321
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:24,759
and stuff like that.

322
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,639
That I create using my tools,

323
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,879
which is like the ID

324
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,479
and the keyboard in the mouse.

325
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,080
But what I create is as creative

326
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,590
as other craftsman

327
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,879
like carpenters and whatnot.

328
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,359
That is how I see it.

329
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,823
Definitely,

330
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:41,399
there's an engineering part of it.

331
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,799
I'm not saying no.

332
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,639
But the way I see it as a craftsman,

333
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,439
and as a craftsman, almost an arts man,

334
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,999
almost an artist,

335
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,158
that is the passion

336
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,839
I bring to my work, a craft.

337
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,119
Right.

338
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,723
And I think that is a great leeway

339
00:11:59,923 --> 00:12:02,159
to the notion of being

340
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,893
the developer relations,

341
00:12:04,093 --> 00:12:05,169
and sharing your craft

342
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:06,439
and sharing your passion.

343
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,519
Because when you explain to me

344
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,405
that you're going up on stage

345
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,999
and you're bubbly and charismatic,

346
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,399
you're talking about code.

347
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,840
You're not talking about philosophy

348
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,200
or economics or politics.

349
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,516
You're talking about JavaScript

350
00:12:19,716 --> 00:12:21,160
often code behind you

351
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,760
and being charismatic about it.

352
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,304
And that is something that I think

353
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,766
is going to be interesting

354
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:26,919
for a lot of people to hear,

355
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,319
because it's very counterintuitive.

356
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,639
Because up until now,

357
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,639
you think of an engineer,

358
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,239
you think of somebody who is a coder,

359
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,319
they're sitting down in their own silo

360
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,759
and they're not really human to human.

361
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,719
And yet you're human,

362
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,519
you're breaking that paradigm.

363
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,739
And then I encourage anybody

364
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:45,719
to go and look up Gil Tayar on YouTube

365
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,119
because you did many of these talks.

366
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,751
First of all,

367
00:12:49,951 --> 00:12:51,159
what is developer relations?

368
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,063
And then, how does that fit

369
00:12:53,263 --> 00:12:54,554
into this idea that

370
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:56,319
there are thought leaders

371
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,880
in the engineering world?

372
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,339
So, developer relations

373
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:03,719
was used to be called evangelism,

374
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,759
and then it became developer relations

375
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,839
and now its developer advocacy.

376
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,759
But it's basically

377
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,559
a lot of things in one.

378
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,000
One is, I'm in Applitools right now

379
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,359
and we do developer tools.

380
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,919
So, if we do developer tools,

381
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,159
we need to market to developers.

382
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,695
And who's the best person

383
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:23,919
to market to developers?

384
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,919
Well, other developers like myself.

385
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,475
So, one thing I do is

386
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:29,519
we're dealing with visual testing.

387
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,759
So, I talk about testing in general

388
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,679
and visual testing and conferences

389
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,159
and thus introduce people

390
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,919
to Applitools, not as a marketing.

391
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,239
I don't say a lot of Applitools.

392
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,159
I mean, demo with Applitools

393
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,759
but that's about it.

394
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,880
But as, okay,

395
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,399
there's this thing called visual testing,

396
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,532
let's try it out

397
00:13:46,732 --> 00:13:48,159
and let's try that with Applitools.

398
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,919
That's one thing.

399
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,919
Another thing is,

400
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,639
is branding of the company.

401
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,022
I mean, WIX has used it in Israel

402
00:13:55,222 --> 00:13:55,959
very nicely.

403
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,551
That is how we started

404
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:59,279
the developer advocacy.

405
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,679
They don't care about developers

406
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,839
in terms of developer tools,

407
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,497
but they want the best developers

408
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:05,959
in Israel to come to WIX.

409
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,359
And one of the best ways to do that

410
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,399
is to create a brand

411
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,251
of WIX engineering

412
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,749
so that developers will want

413
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:14,745
to come to WIX

414
00:14:14,945 --> 00:14:16,279
because they hear me speak

415
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,959
or other developers speak at WIX.

416
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,719
So, that's the other side of developer

417
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,320
but it is great for other companies.

418
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,880
And the third is,

419
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:27,840
we're a community.

420
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,399
There's nothing about I mean,

421
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,079
especially opensource.

422
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,240
It's like everything's free,

423
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,680
everything's community driven.

424
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,280
And bringing given back

425
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,021
to the community

426
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,639
is part of what I do by educating,

427
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,919
by showing what I've learned

428
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,399
and talking and all that stuff.

429
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,359
So, those for me are the three

430
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,639
facets of developer advocacy.

431
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,279
And I love the three of them.

432
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,599
How do ideas spread

433
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,999
in the developer world?

434
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,959
So, in economics and physics would be

435
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,494
through scientific papers,

436
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,239
politics would be through views.

437
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,599
How do ideas spread

438
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,399
in the world of coding?

439
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,519
Because oftentimes,

440
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,319
the things that I see

441
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,359
that you're talking about,

442
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,119
let's say visual testing

443
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,519
or why should write test for your CSS,

444
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,639
I mean, those are things

445
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,959
that are not necessarily mainstream

446
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,039
for a lot of organizations.

447
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,999
And yet you're coming in,

448
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,426
you're suggesting a paradigm shift

449
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:26,159
or breaking conception

450
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,799
that is not that easy.

451
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,799
So, how do these new ideas

452
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,400
become mainstream in our world?

453
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,640
Just like memes,

454
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,039
it's a struggle between ideas out there

455
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,812
and the best idea wins in a way

456
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:47,801
or like the most influential people

457
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:51,276
that bring the best ideas, they win.

458
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:52,639
And in essence,

459
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,959
and credits a lot about you,

460
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,399
not just about

461
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,639
the ideas you bring to the table.

462
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,199
Credentials is going out there

463
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,719
and telling what you're doing.

464
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,366
It doesn't matter

465
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,359
if it's like new visual,

466
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,315
like visual testing

467
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:11,176
or if it's like regular stuff.

468
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:14,691
Like when I talk about ES modules

469
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:15,519
in OJS.

470
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,279
Go out, talk, have people see you,

471
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,719
do a lot of Twitter,

472
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,599
don't do Facebook.

473
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,367
Twitter is where

474
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:25,640
the thought leaders are.

475
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,999
Do and start small.

476
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,999
Don't don't try go to JS cons

477
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,199
right immediately,

478
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,919
which is like this huge conference.

479
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,999
Start with local meet ups.

480
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,479
Gain the confidence there,

481
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,239
gain the people there,

482
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,235
then start going up the ladder

483
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:41,990
to more international

484
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,479
Israeli conferences

485
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,640
and international conferences, etc, etc.

486
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,199
Credibility, it takes time.

487
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,600
Takes like six, seven years or so.

488
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,759
It takes time,

489
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,719
start small, slowly grow up.

490
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,119
Talk about what you know.

491
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,839
It doesn't really matter.

492
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,373
You wouldn't believe

493
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:05,469
how much people

494
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:07,199
are thirsty for information.

495
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,759
Talk about what you know.

496
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,240
It'll be great.

497
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:09,919
100%.

498
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,759
Now, your title is Senior Architect.

499
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,613
And obviously,

500
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:15,799
that's not a building architect.

501
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,319
It's a different type of architecture.

502
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,839
How is that different from being

503
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,040
an engineer or a coder?

504
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,559
What is an architect in essence?

505
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,079
My sarcastic answer to that is

506
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,039
an architect is a coder

507
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,600
who's too old to be called a coder.

508
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,359
But seriously, it's not just that.

509
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,319
Once you reach a certain level

510
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,799
of a system like of a product

511
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,359
where you have more code,

512
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,838
and it's not just one server,

513
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:52,719
one database and rest API or whatever,

514
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,919
once you need a system

515
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,479
comprised of micro services,

516
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,119
message passing and everything,

517
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,393
you need somebody to figure out

518
00:17:59,593 --> 00:18:01,406
what those building blocks

519
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:02,799
of that product is.

520
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,239
And that's what

521
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,118
a software architect does, basically.

522
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,439
I hate software.

523
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,240
I call them architecture astronauts.

524
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:10,239
I hate software architects.

525
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,079
I just build the architecture

526
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,119
and then throw it to developers to code.

527
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,639
That is totally wrong.

528
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,079
I build the architecture

529
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,600
along with other people

530
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,040
and then I just plunge in

531
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,559
and write it as we go along.

532
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,319
Understanding the problems with my design

533
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,299
as I go along

534
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:28,800
and changing it to fit

535
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,280
whatever is needed.

536
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:30,800
100%.

537
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,480
So, for those listening

538
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:34,079
that are deeply passionate

539
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,168
about engineering

540
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:37,640
and they see themselves as craftsmen,

541
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,160
just like you see yourself

542
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,719
and they're excited about these,

543
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,159
about being that Sherlock Holmes

544
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,319
that you're both solving the issue,

545
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,399
you're also a novel writer.

546
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,000
I just I love that analogy.

547
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,719
What tips can you give

548
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,888
from your experience

549
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:53,760
as they're going on their journey

550
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,519
over the years

551
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:00,640
to become better and more skillful?

552
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,919
Two things at least

553
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,319
that come to mind.

554
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,039
One, understand the technology

555
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,719
you're working at in a deep sense.

556
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,599
So, if you're using premises,

557
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,199
please understand premises correctly.

558
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,839
If you're using,

559
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,319
I don't know, functional programming,

560
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,062
try to understand

561
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,039
what functional programming is about.

562
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,399
If you're using Kubernetes or docker,

563
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
how does docker work?

564
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,297
Theoretically,

565
00:19:30,497 --> 00:19:32,879
you don't need that information.

566
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,239
But practically in the real world,

567
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,959
you do sometimes.

568
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,879
And the deeper your understanding is,

569
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,039
the more people will

570
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,239
come to you for advice

571
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,399
and you can figure out

572
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,119
the weird problems.

573
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,839
So, that's one deep understanding

574
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,519
of whatever you're doing.

575
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,759
The second thing is, overcommunicate.

576
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,679
I don't say communicate.

577
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,679
I used to say communicate.

578
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,725
Overcommunicate,

579
00:19:57,925 --> 00:19:59,491
say more than you think

580
00:19:59,691 --> 00:20:00,919
that should be said.

581
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,039
It's like when your acting,

582
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,359
when you're smiling,

583
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,599
you're supposed to smile

584
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,799
much more than regular.

585
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,439
So, when you're communicating,

586
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,279
do more than what you think you should be

587
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,003
and then you get

588
00:20:13,203 --> 00:20:16,559
to the right level of communication.

589
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,399
Okay. Problem solved.

590
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,399
Gil, why over communicate

591
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,880
and not communicate?

592
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,327
Because people

593
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:25,959
tend to under communicate.

594
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,119
So, when you say to people

595
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,960
overcommunicate,

596
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,515
they give the right amount

597
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:31,479
of communication.

598
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,959
Also, when you're explaining something,

599
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,479
when you're talking

600
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,719
about what you're doing,

601
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,407
the other side

602
00:20:36,607 --> 00:20:38,759
doesn't really understand the context.

603
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,439
So, you have to explain and re-explain

604
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,240
and re-explain the context.

605
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,119
And that context,

606
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,599
along with your explanation,

607
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,719
that's how you get over it.

608
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,959
And communication is crazy important.

609
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,839
If you don't communicate,

610
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,919
then people won't know

611
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,320
how good you are.

612
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,760
And vice versa.

613
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,879
And I feel a lot

614
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,960
when I overcommunicate,

615
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,200
When I'm like write, write, write

616
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:02,719
and then I say,

617
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,519
"Hey, wait, that's wrong."

618
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,020
And then go back to my software

619
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,599
and fix it.

620
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,508
A lot of times

621
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,079
when I explain something to somebody,

622
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,919
I figure out things myself.

623
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,999
So, talk, talk, talk.

624
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,160
Write, write, write

625
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,320
as much as possible.

626
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,800
Gil, I think that's such a great insight.

627
00:21:19,801 --> 00:21:20,679
Because I think at the end,

628
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,396
what you're saying about context

629
00:21:22,596 --> 00:21:23,039
is crucial.

630
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,559
We sometimes think for hours

631
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,679
about a problem

632
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,520
and we come up

633
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,160
with our resolution, right?

634
00:21:29,161 --> 00:21:30,039
And it could be

635
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,399
three bullet resolution

636
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,119
of what we think should happen.

637
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,759
And we only provide the outcome,

638
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,600
but we sometimes neglect to provide

639
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,280
the whole thinking process,

640
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,040
which explains the rationale

641
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:41,839
behind the solution.

642
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,279
And even if the other person

643
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,814
understands it,

644
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:44,839
they might not accept it

645
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,245
or they might not even understand

646
00:21:46,445 --> 00:21:47,959
our solution without the context

647
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,559
of the thinking process.

648
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,679
So, that's definitely

649
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,757
one of the most important lessons

650
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,359
that I'm taking with me from this.

651
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,669
Gil, I want to thank you

652
00:21:54,869 --> 00:21:56,639
for both inspiration these 20 minutes.

653
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,039
But overall, I think

654
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,332
it's been maybe seven years

655
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:02,799
since we've been in contact.

656
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,759
So, thank you for that.

657
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,184
And thank you for helping

658
00:22:05,384 --> 00:22:06,999
so many youth around Israel

659
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,599
and the world through hackathon,

660
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,079
through your journey.

661
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,719
And obviously, countless people

662
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,319
that are watching your lectures

663
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,199
and your presentations

664
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,759
on YouTube and live.

665
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,639
But before we leave,

666
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,039
I have to ask you for three words

667
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,280
that you would use to describe yourself.

668
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,360
Fast.

669
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,080
Communicative.

670
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,399
And it didn't really come out this time,

671
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,264
but funny.

672
00:22:34,464 --> 00:22:35,560
Lots of memes.

673
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,120
I can definitely testify for that.

674
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,800
Gil, thank you very much.

675
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,120
Stay safe and stay healthy.

676
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:42,840
Thank you.
