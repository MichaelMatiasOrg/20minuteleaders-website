Jeff Epstein, thank you so much for joining us on 20 Minute Leaders. It's wonderful to be here. Thank you for having me. Okay. So if I started to give a brief bio about you, I wouldn't be able to ask you any questions because 20 minutes would be over. But just for context. Previous CFO of Oracle, but not just any CFO, because you've also been on the boards of the coolest companies. Currently on Twilio and Shutterstock. Incredible companies. But you're on the board of Booking Holdings. And you joined, you said when it was a billion dollars in revenues growing up to 80? Billion dollars in market value, growing to 80 billion. Wow. Okay. So, billion dollars in market value going up to 80 billion. But you're also on the board of Kaiser Permanente? Kaiser Permanente is a large non-profit health care organization that provides both healthcare, hospitals and health insurance for 12 million people, mostly in California and the West Coast. Unbelievable. And you mentioned 230,000 employees. Right. Unbelievable. So, you're sitting on these boards. So I'm gonna have to at some point understand how do you even juggle all of these different positions and how do you then take the skills from the CFO at Oracle and now at Apex, which hopefully we'll be able to get to as well. But Jeff, how do you do it all? It's a serious question. I mean when I think of who I want, the level that I wanna get to one day and have these incredible experiences, you're the persona right now. Thank you very much. Well, I spent 25 years working full time as a chief financial officer where every day you have people that report to you and you have a boss and a board and quarterly earnings. And that was a lot of responsibility. Now that I'm retired from full time work, I serve on these boards but you go to a board meeting - Retired. Okay. I just wanna put the word retired in front of everything that I just said. Okay. So the difference between being a board member is usually you go to the board meeting, you ask a lot of questions. You say, "Boy, sounds like you've got a lot of problems. I'll see you at next board meeting." And management are the people that have to fix the problems we just talk about them. So, there is a lot of governance responsibility, and if occasionally if you have to change the CEO or things like that. There's a lot of work but there are certain companies like Wells Fargo, and over the last few years, they've had, there were PG&E going through bankruptcy. They have a very intense experience, but if the company is doing well, it's a lot easier to be a board member than to the day to day responsibility of being executive. Of course. Of course. And of course - Very rewarding as well because my job is to ask questions. And so, I love learning. I love asking questions, and over the year, after 40 years, you've asked a lot of questions, you get to learn a lot. It reminds me of the nice story of when you go to the doctor and something is hurting in your knee and the doctor hits your knee and says, "Okay now five hundred dollars, please." And you ask, "What? You just hit the knee?" And he said, "No, no, no. I've been studying for 40 years how to hit your knee." So, it sounds like the questions that you're asking now, they're not just any questions, they're questions with dozens of years and a wealth of experience that you bring with you. Right. Exactly. I'll give you an example of a board meeting and I've been trying to talk to some of my CEOs about this. Many of the people on this call might have actually participated in a board meeting. And in my mind, there's sort of three parts to a board meeting. There's the compliance part, the audit committee report, compensation committee, things like that, which in a private company is very short. In a public company it's there's some amount of time. And then the remainder of the time often is the management telling the board what they've been doing. Reporting on what's going on. Here's our product strategy Here's our sales and marketing strategy. Here's our forecast. I call that the show and tell part. And then there's another part of the meeting, the third part, which is here are decisions we're thinking about, but we haven't made them yet, and we'd like to tell you We have three choices and here's the pros and cons of each choice. We recommend option A. We're planning on doing option A. But what do you think? And maybe your questions and your guidance will change our mind. So, should we grow faster and burn more money, lose more money, or should we grow slower and make more money? Right. We have one product just in the US. Should we add a second product in the US, or should we take our first product and expand to the UK? Those kinds of decisions. So, I personally find the decisions we have not yet made to be a much more valuable board meeting as opposed to the show and tell. And the show and tell, in my view, can be done in writing. Put everything, create this big presentation, send it out to the board a week in advance. We'll read it all. We'll ask questions if we don't understand it, but to spend most of the board time just telling us what's in the written material is to me not taking full advantage of the board. So that's an example of the kind of thing that I've learned over the years, which 20 years ago, I probably didn't understand. Now I try to nudge my CEOs in that direction. How would you describe your relationship with your CEOs as a board member? And you have quite a few CEOs that you have to be in touch with. Is this a friendly relationship? Is this more of a boss-employee relationship? What's the intimacy like over there? Well, it depends. If I work for the venture capital partners or private equity partners, they essentially, they are appointed by their firm or the private equity firm Maybe they hire the CEO. In the companies that I'm involved in, personally because I'm always an independent, the CEO meets me and personally wants, recruits me to the board. So, the CEO essentially hired me to be a board member. And essentially, the CEO can fire me if they decide they don't like me on the board. It's never happened, but they could. And so, my role is to help make the CEO as effective as he or she could be. And so, it's by asking questions, by telling stories and anecdotes. So, one way to think about it is, My dogs in the background I don't know if you can hear it sorry - I love it. It just adds. It adds. So, Mark Twain said that history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. And so, if I've been involved in a company before that had a similar problem, I might tell the story. Here's what the situation was. It sounds similar. Here's what they did. Here's what happened. But that doesn't mean you should do the same thing because every situation's different. Right. And so can we stop for a minute I'm gonna see if I could get the dogs quiet. No problem. You'll have to edit that part out. No worries at all. Okay That's what's nice about this spontaneousness of this is that these things just add because it creates much more of I think of an intimacy with my friends from Tel Aviv and Stanford who are viewing this because it's not edited. There's no agenda to make it look perfect. It's as if we're having coffee and we're just sharing with them our coffee. Okay. Right. So, you were telling me about Mark Twain. Yeah. So, Mark Twain said history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. And so my interpretation of that is if I'm at a board meeting and something comes up with the company and there's a challenge or a problem, I'll say: Well, in two or three other situations, I had a similar type of situation. Here's what the situation was. Here's what the company did. It worked or it didn't work. That doesn't mean that you, the CEO, should do the same thing because your situation is gonna be somewhat different. But if you never had any similar experience, you're flying blind whereas if you have the benefit of mine or other people's experience, you can triangulate and piece together the pieces of the puzzle and say, "Well, I think this is relevant." And then you make up your own mind. So, I basically work as a board member, not by telling people what to do, but by asking questions and by telling stories. I think that's incredible. And I haven't gotten to that position and I very much hope to one day be able to be a CEO where you're on the board of. So wait for that request one day. But it sounds to me that a lot of these things you can look up online and read case studies from business schools and understand that how you get to point B from point A. But it sounds like a lot of the added benefit that you would bring to the table is not just A and then B, but it's the whole process and the whole, and the relationships and the intricacies that and the complexity that goes into it. So, you know all the details of the whole process and not just the outcome, right. Yeah it's not only the details, it's also the emotional impact of having lived through it. Right. So, you've probably heard the phrase, "Raise money when you can, not when you need it" And if you hear that, you say, "Okay well that makes sense. That's logical." But I've actually lived through it and I'll tell you that story. I was the CFO of DoubleClick during the Internet boom. And our stock went from, we went public at $250 million at market value, and we were up to $11 billion. So, we were trading at 22 times revenue, a huge price. We're still losing money. We're growing fast. And we were the leading Internet advertising technology company. But by any measure, the company was fully valued. I mean, we clearly weren't undervalued. And so we decided to raise money. And we did a follow-on offering and we were in the market raising $700 million. It's a public company. And we had a roadshow which started Monday morning. We were at a price Thursday night. And on Wednesday at lunch, I'm presenting to investors at a luncheon meeting and I get a call from my office. The message said, "Call NASDAQ". So, I call NASDAQ and they say, "You know, we have a problem." And I go, "Really? What's the problem?" And he said, "Well, we have a lot of sell orders." And I said, "Really? Well how many?" And he says, "Well, we have so many sell orders and no buying interest that we're stopping trading in your stock." And so, for the rest of that Wednesday afternoon, our stock ... trade. And what had happened was there was an article in USA Today that morning about how DoubleClick was violating people's privacy. And that just spooked investors. They didn't know what to think about it. So, we sit with our investment bankers Wednesday night and we say "What's gonna happen?" And they predict accurately that the stock's gonna open up tomorrow morning, down 20%. So, a nine billion dollar valuation. And the question is, should we just pull the offering or should we go ahead with the offering at the 20% lower valuation? And my feeling was the price that it was yesterday is irrelevant. The question is, is nine billion a fair price Yes or no. And for a company with 500 million in revenue losing money, I thought that was a very, still a very good valuation. And even though we had 200 million in cash, we didn't need the money. I thought it was just a sensible thing to raise money when you can. So, I recommended and then we went ahead and raised money. And then of course, the whole market Internet market collapsed. The advertising market collapsed. Our revenue over the next two years dropped by 50% from 500 million to 250 million. But we had 700 million in cash. So, we had a very strong balance sheet. So, it's one thing to say it, it's another to live through it. That's unbelievable. So, and we all have, if you're old enough, you'll all have stories like that. That's just unbelievable. And of course, throughout this whole thing, I gently forgot to mention that that you are teaching one of the most popular courses at Stanford, which I very much hope to take myself one day. Hopefully this upcoming winter. And you're also an operating partner at Bessemer, one of the world's leading venture capital firm. What do you do there? What does that even mean an operational partner? Well I'll talk about that, but I do want to talk about the class, too. Yes. An operating partner means I'm not an investing partner. So I don't make any decisions to invest customers money. I can invest my own money, side by side with Bessemer. And since I was a career CFO what I've done is I've created a CFO advisory board among Bessemer's portfolio company CFOs. So, we have 100 portfolio company CFOs And in any company, there might be 100 or 200 or 300 employees, that CFO probably has no one else in the company to talk to about a finance related issue. Right. But across the portfolio, there's a hundred people to talk to. So we meet, pre-covid times, we meet in person once a quarter. Now we're meeting online. We have an online platform where people are asking each other questions a couple times a week. There's a big database of questions over the last seven years. So, it's a very rich valuable resource of a peer group among our portfolio companies. And so I do that with the CFOs. And then the CEOs I help them in business or finance or capital raising questions or operation questions as well. Wow. But about the class, what the Lean LaunchPad class is It's in the winter quarter. It's Engineering 245 in the Graduate School of Engineering but business students typically are half the class. And it's teams of four or five students with a startup idea. And in 10 weeks they're required to interview 100 potential customers. Wow. Build multiple prototypes, have run many experiments, and with any luck, they generate their first revenue by the tenth week. And we've had now, I guess this will be my eighth year teaching. So, we've had quite a 100 teams or so, graduate from the class. And we've had maybe 15 teams actually form companies and get funding and some of them are doing quite well - Wow. That's huge. ... revenues and some very exciting companies. One of them is fresh technologies, which is AI for grocery ordering. One is Zoom which is Uber for children or for schools type of system. One of them is Nova, which is financial. It's getting credit for ... immigrants who might otherwise find it hard to get credit. So, a lot of really interesting ideas and it's terrific. I just love working with these incredibly talented students. And it's a great experience for the students to get as close to running a business while you're still, without dropping out. So it's a ... experiential class. I just get inspired by you. Again in the first few minutes you mentioned that you're retired, and I think it just speaks to your passion to everything that you're doing, that you're considering yourself retired, yet you do more than people do in a lifetime. To me, I mean, that's really the inspiration. You know all the tips and tricks they're amazing. Very insightful. But the fact that at the end I get to speak to somebody who's calling themselves retired, yet they're doing extraordinary things. I mean almost everything that you're doing here is world class level that any amazing entrepreneur would wish they could do. To me, that's inspiring and that's definitely one of my goals in life to be able to say that I'm retired yet work as much as you do. Jeff, I have to ask, CFO Oracle, everybody knows Oracle and the incredible things that this company has done. You've seen it also earlier on. What does even a CFO do? I don't get to speak to many CFOs in my daily life. Well, of course, the CFO at any size company does is responsible for the same functions. Accounting, treasury risk, capital raising, financial planning and forecasting. The difference is, is that when I was the CFO of DoubleClick years ago, I started out we had 180 people and I probably did 25% of the work myself. I would run the Excel models myself. And then I ... the investor presentation myself. And then I delegate 75% of the time. You know you start off in your career you do 100% yourself. You have no one to delegate to. Right. At that time I was a manager. I had a team. Initially I had a team of maybe 10 people. It grew to, probably at the peak there, I would say maybe a 100 people in finance out of two thousand, typically 5% of the head counts in finance. But at Oracle, I did virtually zero percent personally and delegated 100%. So, if I had written the investor relations presentation myself, the head of investor relations would have said, "You know why am I here?" So, even if I have ideas about investor relations, the best way to do is to sit down with the head of investor relations and say, "You know here are some of my ideas, but, you know, you go off and do it and then I'll give you some guidance." But fundamentally, it's a leadership role as opposed to, and it's a decision making role as opposed to a doing role so it changes quite a bit. Oracle is an incredibly well-run organization and has been for decades. And 40% profit margins. And just extremely good at what it does. And how do you go through that transition? I mean, yourself going and having to see a company through its early stages to its more advanced stages. How do you even get yourself to understand because it's different orders of magnitude for the problems, right? We're back. Wonderful. I might have, I don't know it's my internet connection Sorry about that No worries. What I was asking, though, which was I think it's very interesting. I mean, you've grown as a CFO from early stage startups, in terms of annual revenues, all the way up to the billions. It can't be the same mindset and the same day to day responsibilities and thinking. You have to be transitioning yourself. What is that like transitioning from millions to billions? Well, I did it over 25 years. It wasn't overnight. Still sounds very fast. That is a big difference. And between DoubleClick and Oracle, I was the CFO of a big group at Nielsen, the television ratings and the Internet ratings company. So, they were a global company with many thousands of employees. So, I had that exposure to large companies. One difference that Larry Ellison, years ago, the founder and chairman of Oracle. Oracle started with a country structure, grew very fast in the early days, and they had Oracle US, Oracle UK, Oracle Japan. And one day around, I'd say 20 years ago, he said, "We are a big company now, but we're operating like seventy five small companies. And what we should do is centralize and to take advantage of ... scale" And so over the course of about two years, they went from a 75 different country structure to one global structure. So, each country had its own CEO and its own CFO. And then when it was all over, there was no other CEOs, no other CFOs. I was the only person in Oracle with the title of CFO. There was only global controller, one head of marketing. Things like that. And there are tradeoffs. It can be centralized or decentralized. But Oracle was an example of an extreme case of very effective and efficient centralization. In contrast, Booking Holdings grew through acquisition and we own booking.com, Priceline, Kayak, Open Table, and other companies and each of those businesses had its own, not only its own CEO and CFO, but had its own complete business. There was almost no shared resources. And it also ran extremely well as a very decentralized entrepreneurial organization. So there's no right answer. But I think whichever strategy you have you want to execute it well. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Jeff, I can't believe our time is almost up. It's so sad every time. You know, give me one or two earned secrets, true earned secrets that you would give me a young entrepreneur, just starting my journey. Hopefully going to try to make an impact and a dent on the world in a positive way. What are really extraordinary things that I should be keeping in mind over the next decade as I pursue this dream? Well let me answer that in two ways. For entrepreneurs, if you're starting a company from scratch, what we teach in this class is the first step is to get to product market fit. And so, what you wanted my advice for most companies, software companies, is to try to create the smallest possible product with the smallest ever customers who love you a lot. And Paul Graham ... puts it this way. He said "You'd rather have 10 customers who love you, than a million customers who like you" And the logic is, if you've created a product that 10 customers love, I'm pretty confident you could find an 11th and then you can find a 12th. But if you have a lot of customers who just like you, you know tomorrow they're gonna go on and like something else. Right. So you wanna start a small, and if you think about Facebook started just at Harvard and within two weeks, he had 90% of all Harvard students loving Facebook. And Airbnb started with literally renting an airbed in someone's apartment. So they started with a very small product view and a very small number of customers, but they built huge companies. And so, I think you can't build a jet engine company that way, but for many businesses you can. That's on the entrepreneur side. If you're an employee, my favorite sort of tactic is, if when you're interviewing for a job, you're gonna have a boss and ask your boss, tell your boss this, say, "Listen, let's pretend you hire me. Let's imagine you hire me. And a year from now you're sitting giving me my performance review." And you say, "Boy, I made a great decision Jeff, hiring you, for the following three because you've accomplished the following three things." What are those three things? What it does is it forces your hiring manager to crystallize what his or her expectations are of you. And then if you know exactly what the expectations are, then you can exceed them. Can I reverse that and use that as the hiring manager as a tactic to really align expectations properly and sort of give my ideal performance review ahead of time and then have them try to match it throughout the year? Yeah, I think that's a great a second application. And then a third application is - I love it. when you start a new job and you haven't already had that conversation, have that conversation with your boss the first week of your job because ... a good leader will do that anyway. But many managers and leaders aren't experienced and just don't know that tactic. And then you can go for a long time thinking you're doing what you should be doing and realizing that you're not necessarily focused on the top goals. I imagine that grows in a few orders of magnitude in tech when a lot of leaders are not necessarily leaders, but they are more tech experts who've grown to be team leaders organically through their organization. Yeah. A similar example, I focused there on three things, but an even more powerful technique is to focus on one thing. So I sat at a dinner party once next to George Roberts of KKR, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and we were talking about the problems of education in America. And he said, "You know, Jeff, if you could do one thing to improve education in America, what would be?" And I had thought a lot about education, but I actually never thought of that particular If I only could do one thing, what's the one most important thing? And I realize that's actually the best question to ask many people in many circumstances. Whatever your basement situation, just say, "If you could do one thing, what's the one most important thing you could do?" It's incredibly powerful. I love it. I just love it. Jeff, before we leave, I have to ask you a question that I ask every person on the show, and I'm especially curious to hear your answer. I'd love to hear three words that you would use to describe yourself, or if I were to ask any of the CEOs that you've worked with, whether they're at Shutterstock or Booking or Kaiser, what would they think of when they think of Jeff Epstein? Curious. Analytical. Helpful. I love it. Jeff, thank you so much for the inspiration. Thank you for the time. I can't even imagine how you're juggling everything that you're doing yet you're still giving me these 20 minutes. And so thank you for your generosity. I'll add that as the fourth word. Stay safe and stay healthy. Great Michael, thank you very much. And I'll see you in class in the winter. Well, I'm sorry to say, you actually have to apply to the class and get accepted. So ... application. I'm just putting in the hint, but I'll definitely apply. Sounds good. I'm planting the seeds. Okay. Take care. Bye bye. Bye.
