1 Orit Balicer Tsur, thank you so much for joining me. How are you? Good, how are you? Fantastic. It's 9:00 p.m. It's after Shabbat dinner where you're at. So first of all, thank you for taking the time to do this so late. And what you mentioned was that this is the reality of living between continents, right? That's right, yeah. I'm used to it by now. Definitely. So, architect by profession, then turning into a product manager at Lyft. Serial entrepreneur with an acquisition behind you. And now running a startup at stealth mode. And while you can't share too much about it, I'd love to hear a little bit about the insights that led you towards this new endeavor. But Orit, take me back all the way to Bezalel. Take me back to your architecture days. Like what was architecture all about, because if you're looking at your track record today, it seems so bizarre to be on your resume. Yeah, I know. It's really not the usual way to do it. Most of the product managers or entrepreneurs come from a different background, but I wanted to be an architect since I was, I think, 10. My best friend's grandfather was a very good architect and I saw his work and I was, "Okay. This is the profession that I want to choose for myself when I grow up." What was it about architecture? Why? I think one thing was about creation, creativity. The way that you just invent things and then people use them. And I think there was something holistic about architecture. It was a little bit of math, a little bit of art, a little bit of psychology. And you just had everything in it and it was very appealing to me. And there was the thing about it was a profession that had a name. It was, what are you? I'm an architect. It's very, it's ... You can explain it. You can understand, you can grasp ... when you are a kid and when you are a grown up too. Something that is easily explained to your grandmother. Much more difficult when you're running a stealth startup, right? Exactly. Exactly. What is it exactly that you are doing. I'm not sure if, I mean, my parents know what I'm doing, but they're not really ... understand fully what I'm doing how my day to day look like. And so, I went ahead and I studied architecture in Bezalel Jerusalem, Israel. And I became an architect. And I loved it. If you would ask me during my years at Bezalel if I would ever change profession, I would tell you, "Hell no. No way." I will be an architect. That's the best profession in the world. I still think that. I mean, definitely in terms of, what is architecture, the essence of it, it's the most beautiful profession in the whole world. It's a little bit different, I think, the day to day. I mean, dealing with contractors is not exactly what you were thinking about when you were studying. But still, a beautiful thing to do. And what happened, eventually, was that I was working as an architect and I was teaching at Bezalel after I graduated, but I had this opportunity to come and work for a startup first one when I was still a student I was employee number six in Kaltura, which was, still is, an amazing company. And it all started back then. We were working from, I would say the garage. The garage was very nice. Very well ... But still, it's like it was building it from the essentials and it was an amazing experience. And then when I was only an architect, I had all these chances to go and be a consultant to different startups. And I said, "Yeah, I like it." I mean, I like doing it so I'll do it after hours. So I had a day job and then a night job as a consultant. One of the companies that I worked for was Soluto, which back then had a product that was built for, I think almost two years, and no even one user saw the product back then. Wow. It sounds crazy today, but the days were before the lean startup. It wasn't so obvious that you have to meet the users in order to build a good product. And so there was a great technology, amazing team. And I joined to start running the alpha, the beta, and go out. We went to TechCrunch Disrupt and we won the first prize at TechCrunch Disrupt. At Soluto, I started as a consultant, but what happened was that the CEO asked me to stay a little longer and be head of marketing, and I said, "Okay. I will do that for a couple of years and then I'll go back and be an architect." Of course. Unbelievable. - And I'm still waiting. No, I do have to say Orit, because, the way that I'm thinking about the architecture scene and I'm thinking about the startup scene. The startup scene is all about agile and about trying new things. And maybe back then, back in the day in Kaltura and Soluto, we still didn't have the lean startup methodology and it wasn't about move fast and break things. But today, it's very evident that when you're running a startup, and I'm sure that when you were running your product at Lyft, which we'll talk about very soon, it's all about trying very quickly things getting a lot of market validation. When you're an architect, when you're building an office space or you're building a building, it's like the most waterfall thing you can do, right? You lay out all the plans and then you're committing to a three year project when, God forbid, something changes I'm just assuming. So, it's interesting how you're relating the two things, but you're not focusing on the difference between them, you're focusing on the beauty behind each industry. Definitely, and I think Well, you said three years. I think that's true in the States, but in Israel, I think you are not ... It's amazing. I think one of the reasons why I went and wanted to be an architect was this notion of thinking about something, making it realized, and then it's going to be there after you. And that was an amazing thing to think about, for me. And with startups, it's not exactly the same thing; it's not going to be there after you. It's, as you said, like a very short cycle. You're building something, five years from now, what you build is no longer going to be there. You have to keep reinventing everything. But that has beauty of its own in a way. So I think architecture and entrepreneurship and product, it's very similar in the way you think about I have a concept, I have an idea of how I'm going to make people's life better. And then I'm going to account everything that I have to take from all sides. From financials and from behavioral aspects and delightfulness and all sorts ... you think about. And then I have to translate that to a different language that someone else have to go ahead and execute. So you have to do ... So, both are very similar in that kind of way, but what's nice about building startups is that you see the small dents that you're making. It's not going to be there for years, people are not living in it, but you're making this dent and you see it immediately. And ... it's pretty exciting because you see it from scratch coming real, it's kind of magic in a way. And in larger companies, what's amazing is seeing the data. It's building something and then you're putting it out there. Millions of people are using it the day after. And then you're starting to see the effect of it. And the effect is amazing, because if you are doing something that has meaning, then you automatically, when you A/B test it, you automatically see the difference. You see it, it's just there. That's a different- Right. So, you have the privilege of both running an early stage startup, which also got acquired. So you were saying how you have this hypothesis, but really, only to get to be able to test this hypothesis, which really is the essence of the company, it can take a lot of time and this is sort of the make or break moment. And then you go on and you're running a product within Lyft. And you're get to see ... We have this hypothesis, let's just roll something out to do A/B testing, and within the next day, we can make some executive decisions and hypothesize on how this is going to grow. Talk to me a little bit about this product you were building at Lyft and some of this process that you went through as a product manager, perhaps even looking at some of the lessons you learned from your architecture days. Sure. So actually I think, in a way, the product I built for lift, actually, I used some of the understanding of how cities and people work, how they behave. Yeah, because the first product I built for Lyft was around commute. What I was doing at Lyft was running shared ride experiences, which is basically every new experience or new product that more than one rider is using. And so ... one was focusing on commute and was this idea around, Okay so, for Lyft, you're tapping a button and you're getting a driver and they take you to the place that you need to go which is amazing for a certain people or for certain situations, but if you are not making like a lot of money, you can't use ... commute. So, I was trying to figure out how we can make it cheaper for people to ride every day. How we can make it more, let's say, how people can plan around it, which was very important. Trying to figure out what's important for people who commute is very different than trying to figure out what is important when you are going out for a date or a ride to the airport. -100% And some of the values were around how I can plan around it. How I can know that I'm getting exactly, or a very similar experience every day. That was very important. The behavioral aspect was very important, more than I imagined. Apparently people prefer to get, let's say, a less super experience in terms of like how long they are riding, which I think is, in a way, counterintuitive, but they would rather ride longer but if they're riding the same way, they know exactly how long it's going to take. And they're taking the ride from the same spot and getting to the same spot. Sometimes meeting the same people on the way and riding with them. That's more important than getting there the fastest ... Apparently people prefer to know that they are going to be at the office at 9 a.m. rather than like sometimes, at 8:30 and sometimes at 9:30. And so, we designed a product according to that, those insights that we got from people. But Orit, how do you get those insights? Is this solely based on analytics and you're watching how hundreds of thousands of people are interacting with your product and whether what is the churn rate and what they're focusing on? Or do you actually have to go and speak to them personally? How does it even work? So, that's the nice thing about a big company. When you're in a very large company with a very large user base, you can do both. And the thing about asking questions are you have to ask the right questions. And you don't know how to ask the right questions and then try to figure it out with data if you don't have a hypothesis. So, to get that hypothesis, you have to have good intuition, I think, and a lot of empathy to your users. And you have to speak with them. So I would say the process, in a way, in the beginning, is more similar to building a startup ... First you have to talk face to face with people who experience it who, and you have to ask the right questions. You don't want to influence them. You don't want to have these ideas that you're having ... in their minds. You have to get the real problems, the real pains, figure them out, and then try to solve them. And once you do that, you can try and ask the questions with data. You can try and figure out if you are right or wrong. And usually the right way you do it is not go ahead and build this huge product that is containing everything you had in mind and have this amazing experience end to end all figured out, because you're probably going to be wrong about at least some of it. And then, the way I think about it is, you have to break your assumptions to little pieces and try the leanest way to figure each one out with data. And once you have that and have you know, you can start to build your bigger vision and transform it into a product. Again, something very, very different from when you're designing a building that is meant to bring a delight to the customers. And there, you can't really just build like one room and then say, "Hey, do you like this?" Maybe you can, I don't know. Maybe it's sophisticated enough. But it sounds like especially when you're running a startup or product manager at Lyft, you were able to take these very small chunks of hypotheses and implement them in small scenarios and test them out. But I want to talk a little bit about the insights that are leading now towards your next venture, which hopefully by the time this airs, we'll know a little bit about. What are those insights? What got you really excited into this idea of the future of workforce? So I think one of the reasons I was starting to be kind of obsessed with this problem space was, I was naturally taking Lyfts every day, twice a day, at least. And I was talking to the drivers all the time. Sometimes it was part of the work. Most of the time, just because I liked talking with people. And then, I tried to figure out what's bothering them. Why are they doing it? And I felt very fortunate to work for a ride sharing company, because I felt it gives the drivers this opportunity to make a living when sometimes they can't. Many of the people had those situations where they were unemployed and or between jobs or moving between one geography to another or waiting to get their certificate. And so being able to ... them. So, I think that opportunity they had to be able to just get in the car and start earning money so they won't lose everything was really important. To me, it was a great mission, a great crowd to work for. But then underneath that big mission and that opportunity, lies a lot of problems that are unsolved yet just with ride sharing. So talking with them, I thought that sometimes they don't want to do it because maybe they don't have a prospect. They can't see how they're going to have to progress or have to learn something new or to have a career path or possibly do just between some parts, between jobs. And then other problems were that they were thinking they can make a living, but not all drivers can make a living out of ride sharing. It's just the nature of how those marketplaces work is that they have peak hours and downtimes, and some drivers can really optimize their time and sometimes they are very lucky and they can get enough rides, but if they're not at the right place at the right times, they just don't get rides and they can't make a living ... just driving. Well, statistically, more than 80% of the drivers are working on more than one platform because of that. Really? Okay. Yeah, it's crazy, but that's the number. And so I was thinking how can I make those people's life better? How can I provide them with everything that is lacking, and how can I build a product that will suite them? And that's how I started Overall, which is still in stealth mode. So, unfortunately I'm not going to talk a lot about what it is exactly, but stay tuned. I love it. I love it. Well Orit, best of luck with Overall. Just in two in two sentences, give me a little bit of taste as to what Keeprz was and a little bit about being a first time entrepreneur running You've joined early stage companies before, but now you're running your own company, you're one of the co-founders. You get to the acquisition. What are some of the key moments in that journey that you're gonna take with you into your next venture? So, there are several. And I think, and looking at that, it's not just Keeprz, it's I think it's kind of a thing that was built throughout my career and you can kind of connect the dots. So, Keeprz was an amazing experience. It was the first time I'm an entrepreneur. I saw how it was done by other great enterprise I work with and ... done it before. And I think one of the amazing things that I discovered was that I can be jack of all trades. I can do everything. I was designing the screenings with illustrator skills that I had from Bezalel. And I was building the experiences and I was marketing and analyzing the data we had and interviewing potential clients. And I just had to do all of it and be good, good enough, let's say, with everything. And then, when I got to Lyft, I figured that kind of skill is not required anymore. I didn't have to do everything anymore. Actually, I wasn't supposed it wasn't a good idea to do everything by myself. Lyft had amazing engineers and data scientists and great designers, and then I had to figure out well, then what is my role here. Right. And I think my main lesson was I have to take those amazing people and make sure that the good ideas that I'm having are resonating with them. Everyone knows what direction they have to run. And then run the fastest they can to ... And taking that lesson with me, actually I think it's pretty much I take it now to my new startup even though it's just starting. And it's not ... I still have to be jack of all trades, but building the team means I have to think about what kind of team I'm building, what kind of culture, a culture which puts those people in the center of things and being aligned and working together and bringing A type people. 10X engineers, 10X designers, because once you have those amazing people, you just have to lead the way and everything kind of happens the right way. Orit, thank you again for being so generous with your time and for all the insight. This was wonderful. Before we leave, I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. Okay. So, I would say creative or creating. That's the one thing that's important for me. That's why I'm waking up in the morning. The other word I would say would be doubt. I'm doubting ... I don't take anything for granted. I try to check, I try to figure out if the assumptions are right. I think that would be the second one. The third one would probably be family. I love it. The one most important thing in my life. 100% and I'm sure it's gonna be an interesting ride going through now an early stage startup still in stealth mode with the family. But best of luck and I can't wait to see more about Overall, and thank you again for being so generous with your time. It's really great. Thank you for having me. Take care.
