Tal Barnoach, thank you so much for being on my show, 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? Good. Thank you for having me. Where are you calling from right now? From my office in Herzliya. Wonderful And how is everything over there with the whole covid situation and obviously all the protests that are happening? There is tense. But in terms of covid, there were 1,500 cases per day. There is about 380 in hospitals that are in more difficult situations. They're trying to manage it and to take the numbers down. Hopefully by September 1st when kids are going back to school, it's going to be much better than now. Definitely. Definitely. And I have to say that while you hear about covid all the time, one of the things that I'm really curious and I'm very excited about, for this conversation specifically, is to talk about your journey. You're currently running Disruptive Ventures, but you have a long history in the tech industry. All the way from your days in the intelligence forces, moving on to creating your own companies, and being a serial entrepreneur. I believe you were in some caliber another a part of three or four acquisitions which is just, I'm sure there's phenomenal stories from there. But then moving on to becoming an angel investor, now a VC. And you're on nine different boards, Tal, I have no idea how you do this. One of them is one of my favorite companies, Tailor Brands. I'm completely inspired about what Yali and the team are doing over there. So, I loved seeing that you were on their board. But Tal, let's start easy. Just give me a little bit of a background about your journey. Who are you? Like, why did you do all these things? It's a great question. Well, so you know, in Israel you have to serve in the army at the age of 18. It's compulsory. So, I did the first few years from 18 up to 22 and then obviously in the reserve. In the Army, I was in a special intelligence unit. You can't really talk a lot about it, but I can say that that was the first time where someone gave me a real chance, because I was pretty junior. And at the age of between 20, 21 the head of the unit called me one day and said, "There is a guy here that he's ranked about three, four ranks above you. From tomorrow morning you're replacing him." which was shocking to me, and I was not prepared. I had basically the weekend to mentally get ready for a new job. And it was probably Thursday. And on Sunday, I got in, had to manage a lot of people in a very, very tough environment in this unit, in many places. Tal, I do have to say it's something that keeps coming up and I believe I heard it first when Eric Schmidt talked about it I think maybe eight years ago at a conference in Tel Aviv. And he was talking about this magic of the startup nation. That part of it is really this idea that, at 18 years old, we enter this army and I'll never forget coming to the boot camp and being handed and I'm 16. And then going through rigorous training on how to be responsible with it. And I thought how could, and I was so confused that at 18 years old we're given such responsibility. And the person who was teaching me how to handle my life responsibly is a 19 year old who is just six months above me. So what you're talking about I think it really resonates and that feeling of responsibility and getting those opportunities are really remarkable. But then, how do you transition from your experience in the IDF onwards to then, to the real life, to the startup life? So, I decided after that I went to university. And then I wanted to do my MBA in the US. And I went to US to get interviewed in a few good universities. And then I got a call from someone that said that he heard about me and if I'm willing to come back to Israel instead of doing my MBA and start working in a manufacturing plant in the north side of the country. - Wow That at that time was very unique with unique technology and so forth. And he said, "You will make 2,000 shekel." which is equivalent today of $600. Right. This is what you're going to make at first, but if you be good and what I heard about you is true and ... you'll be able to gain both experience and to go up in terms of your salary. And I decided to come back to Israel. And I was going five years every day from here, Herzliya, Ramat Hasharon to the north side, which is Karmiel. So, that's like an hour and a half. It's one hour 45 minutes each way. To be exact. Tal, why did you do this? In comparison, any people who are watching this, and obviously these are maybe different times but it can't be that great of a gap, because today I enter Stanford, and freshman year the first question that they ask you is, "Where do you do your internship in the summer?" The second question is, "How much money are you making?" One of the greatest pieces of advice that I've been hearing is follow your curiosity, not the money, because the money will follow. And I think that that's where you're alluding to as well. But I'm thinking, I'm seeing my friends who are making $6,000 for a summer internship per month and you're talking about $600. Why did you choose to go to that route? Because I thought that there is an amazing opportunity. I knew that if I will show that I'm good at what I'm doing, then I'll be able to go up and to show them that I can manage the process. And yeah, after five year, I was making three times all of my friends what they did. And I was number two in the company and number one was ... And the company went public. And then I came to the CEO, which was the one of the owners, and I told him, after we went public, I said, "Who is going home; you or me?" So, I was young. He told me, "If I wasn't part of the family, I will go and you should take it, but I'm part of the family I can't go anywhere. But I really want you to stay. I'm willing to offer you anything you can think about." But I said, "No no. I want to be entrepreneur and it's time for me to go." So I was staying there for another nine months, and then I left. Before you continue to the next part of the journey I want to go back. What you mentioned first when you joined this ... you talked about the fact that they have this unique technology and that it was an interesting opportunity. You forwent a big life decision going to the US, going to do an MBA, to go and work at a factory in the north of Israel. This is irregular by any means at any point in time. How big a factor was your curiosity in driving the technology that was there or the actual job that you're going to do? Or was it primarily this idea that you felt this could be a good stepping stone to become a leader in this company? So yeah. It's I think it's all of it. But the first was, I believe that I can do an impact there. Second, that if I'll do the right job, I know that I can become senior in a position. And third I said to myself, "The experience that I will gain there is unmatched" and for me, the experience was really important. I love it. I love it. Okay. So, I'm already taking a lot of inspiration from that. And you decide, that's just the beginning of your career in terms of actually hands on work. You then go and you work at a few other startups, but I want to make sure we also leave time to talk a little bit about your take today. So, walk me through now your transition from being- I'll walk you now fast. The first company as entrepreneur, it was in the multimedia area before the Internet. And with the Israeli chutzpah, we went to the International Olympic Committee, the IOC, and to the NBA. It was Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC president, and David Stern, the NBA commissioner. And we got exclusive worldwide rights for all the Olympics and NBA media. Why the Israeli chutzpah? Explain to me that part. Because two guys out of nowhere going to convince these guys that we are their partners and we are going to do a much better job than Microsoft and anyone else. And after eight, nine months of negotiation, that literally we had no money whatsoever, we were sleeping like in small motels in different places. But we came to the meetings with suits and everything was like. I love that. We had to do the show. So every time we came, we showed them that we are an amazing and might be a big company and so forth when we didn't have 20 bucks in our pocket. That's beautiful. Wow. I remember once that we had to, they called us for immediate meeting. It was in Rosh Hashanah, which is the most important holiday, one of the most important holidays in Israel. And we had to go to Switzerland and to stay there over for the holiday not with the family and so forth. So, I think that one thing that is coming out of all of it is the commitment. That once you are committed to the process, to the project, to the company, as a founder, it's a really significant part of your life and of your success. How do you measure that today when you're running Disruptive Ventures and you're looking at really great entrepreneurs, but you're obviously seeing both the good and the bad. And I'm guessing that through this lesson, one of the things you're looking for is this commitment level, right? - Absolutely This engagement. Absolutely, and I'm telling those entrepreneurs that are coming to me every day. I'm saying, "Guys, you're going to 10 to 12 years commitment to a company that you're going to live, breath. All of your life is going to be around it. It's going to be much less family time, less friends time. Less all of that" But if it's, I'm saying that if it's really into you, it's in your body, and you decided that you're going to do it, nothing will stop you. And I felt it as entrepreneur, and I know today that when I see those guys that are coming with the eyes open like this and they talk about their ideas, and you see the passion and the energy and everything else, you know that you have someone that you can go with. So obviously, one of the big tasks that you're faced with is to differentiate between artificial passion or theatrical passion with real intrinsic passion, right. Because I'm guessing, especially around the world, a lot of accelerators and a lot of startup schools they teach you how to pitch and they teach you how to present. And now with my ... on as a senior associate at J-Ventures, as I'm examining different early stage startups, a lot of times I ask myself, "Are these people really passionate about what they're doing, or do they feel like they're sort of in a Y combinator demo day that they have to go and scream at me?" Right? So how do you, is that all intuition? Or how do you go about and measure whether somebody is really ready to make that commitment? It's you have to meet them again and again and again. Right. And to ask all the questions that you think that are relevant. You're coming from this way, You're coming from this way. - Right. ... to understand. You have a picture that you're trying to understand, their commitment, their level of commitment, how excited are they about it, and how long they're willing to go with their passion and dream. Because if you don't have it, I think it's the odds of successful startups are against those who are starting it. The statistics. So, if you don't have the passion and the energy and everything else, the odds are much less. So, you need to have so many things, so many ingredients, into the equation that the startup will be successful, that you need to bring some of it in terms of your body language, your energy, your passion, the way you describe it, and then it will help you. So angel investments, they sound great. I get to talk to quite a few angel investors, and it seems like it's living the life, working out of coffee shops and meeting great entrepreneurs. Why form a VC? Why form Disruptive Ventures? And what is Disruptive Ventures? What is sort of the mission there? So Disruptive. We started Disruptive because So I was entrepreneur, and then angel, and then I started Disruptive. And Disruptive, I said to myself that there is a vacuum between the seed stage and round A. We called it seed plus. I heard many talk about this. Like the power seed round. That people need this extra. Yeah. And in Israel at that time, there was no scale between there. So what was happening, when I started Disruptive, there was so many companies that got seed money but couldn't go up to the A-round because they're left with no money after the half a million dollars to a million dollars they got. And then they were not ready for the A-round. So I said, I will tackle this place between the seed and the round A, and I will invest in those companies, will give them the one to two million dollars to help them go to the A-round. So that was the thesis behind it. Why Disruptive? Because I really believe that the Israeli entrepreneurs have to come with disruption, ideas, technologies, products, business model, and so forth, to compete with all of the global companies out there, whether they are in Silicon Valley, in the East Coast, in Europe, in Asia and so forth, because we are nine million people country and we have to think global from the get go. If you don't come with the real disruption, if you don't change the way people consume product, work with product, come with innovation, do something that is really different, it will be very difficult to compete with those companies there. I love it. By the way, Tal, just to make sure that when you're talking about this stage where you are investing, are you just adding on to the seed round, or are you a bridge round between the seed and series A generally? Sometimes I will write the seed check, but it will be a bigger check than the usual one. And sometimes it will be the bridge between the seed and round A. I'm now doing my third fund, which called disruptive AI which is the junction between disruption and AI technology. I brought a new team to help me with disruptive AI. ... who was the second in command in 8200, ... that was a general partner in JVP, and professor Yossi Keshet from Bar-Ilan University which have the biggest AI lab in the country. So, we formed a group of people that will do investments in the junction between disruption and AI, which I think it's kind of the way to go when you move forward. When you look at the next 10 years, AI is going to be a very important part of our life in general for the things that we're going to do, behave and so forth. And the fact that now, because of big data and because of you can really get a lot of information that you couldn't get before, it's really helping you to form those companies. So, we're really excited about it. 100%. And you know Tal, we have just a few minutes, but I have to get your input. You're a board member of eight or nine companies right now which I have no idea how you're juggling all those. Give me your two cents about the responsibilities of being a board member. What do you enjoy most about this experience? Or what is your responsibility as a board member there? So I'll be very honest here, and I know that I'm a bit different from other people. Board is not important. Okay. What is important is the work that you do with the entrepreneur all year long, every month, every week, every day. Board is kind of a summary of what's happening up to now and what you forecast for the future. But we work with the entrepreneurs all the time. So, I know before the board what will be in the board meeting. I want to prepare myself for this board meeting. And I think that, I'm always saying that because I work with young entrepreneurs, you mentioned Yali, but there is Yali and David and Danielle and all of those guys, I'm a psychology I'm just not charging for it. I love it. So, those guys are coming to me all the time and they have problems here and they have problems there, and it's a roller coaster. And one day they think that they're the next Google and the day after, Oh my God they're going bust. - Yeah. And you need to really be helpful for them and understand what, where they are. And give them a hug. And when you need to be tough, be tough. But really, I think that it's the whole enchilada that you're really supporting them and giving them your help and empathy and sympathy to help them really go through the tough times. The board is the other side of it means that you really come to a two hours meeting, seven, eight people. You get the summary from the company. You decide where you're going. You help them lead the next quarter or so, but I think the really important work is what you do in between and not those. Tal, completely inspiring. I just love it. Right before we leave, and by the way I have to mention that now I can't wait to share with you a slide deck hopefully in the coming years as I go on my own entrepreneurial journey. But before then, I need three words from you. Three words that you would use to describe yourself or that any of your founders that work with you on the day to day would describe you as. Focused. Okay. Persistent. And friendship. Focused, persistent, and friendship. I love it. And obviously I didn't give you time to prepare, but I think that those three words are already exuding through the whole conversation that we had. So Tal, I want to thank you again for your generous time and I know how busy you are. I think you have about nine board meetings to attend to now and more companies to invest in, so thank you very much. Toda raba. Thank you, Michael. Thanks. Take care.
