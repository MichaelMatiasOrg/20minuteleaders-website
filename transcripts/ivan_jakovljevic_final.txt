1 A lot of times we think about the way that we do business, it kind of developed countries that we're like, well, you know, we're going to do it in an efficient way. We'll just jump on a call and kind of get things done. Well, that's not typically how things work in a lot of other countries in the region and you kind of need to be sensitive to all of these nuances if you want to actually be successful. Ivan Jakovljevic, thank you so much for joining me. How are you? I'm very good, thank you. Good to be here with you in Dubai. It's wonderful to be here in Dubai. So, we have a whole new set of you know, I've been doing this over Zoom for 250 episodes. And done one episode in person. This is my second one. And I'm honored to do it with you here in Dubai. Thank you for joining me. Absolutely. Great to have you here. Ivan, we are in the beautiful Emirates Tower. I don't think that we can really see it here, but I'm just going to show it anyway. The incredible view of Dubai, really a phenomenal place of innovation. I've been shocked and blown away by what's happening in this place. Ivan, how did you get to Dubai? Because you've done Stanford Business School. You're originally from Serbia. You've spent many years in Google. How do you end up helping run investments and portfolio companies in Dubai? Short answer, by chance, obviously. Right? So, the story is as follows. I'm originally from Serbia, as you mentioned. So, I moved to the states to do Stanford Graduate School of Business. That was back in 2006. After graduating, I joined the consulting firm and moved to the city of San Francisco. And back in the day, my thinking was essentially like, kind of follow my American dream, right? All I have to do is kind of you know, have a couple of kids, two and a half kids, to be more precise, white picket fence, a dog, and I should be all set, right? Except that somehow life worked out. So, after a couple of years in consulting in 2008, you know, there was the global financial crisis and markets kind of started to rumble a little bit. And the firm that I was with at the time, they were basically looking, they had a booming and thriving business here in the Middle East. They were looking for people within the system to kind of move temporarily to the Middle East to kind of help them essentially deliver on all the projects that they were able to sell. Right. So, you know, before I knew it, I was basically like, you know, what's the worst thing that could possibly happen. I have never been to the Middle East before, right? The only thing I knew about the Middle East was kind of from six o'clock news. And that was never a good thing. Never a good thing. But I've been thinking like, you know, it's like the land of eternal sun, go there, go for a couple of years, you know, make some tax free money, repay my student loans, and before I knew it, I was going to be back home. Right? Or that's at least what I thought. That was 2008, fast forward to 12 and a half years. I guess, you know, life is temporary as it is, but it turned out to be a little bit more temporary than the original two years idea. Unbelievable. So, you joined Google, right? You spend quite a long time with Google, helping them expand their market and grow into Middle East North African markets. What is that like? What does that responsibility entail? What are some of the biggest challenges that you've had along that journey? Yes, one of the things that people don't necessarily, not understand, but like comprehend, right, is we talk about MENA, which is the Middle East and North Africa region, a lot of people kind of talk about it as kind of a region which is relatively uniform. But in reality, it's anywhere between 19 and 21 countries depending on the day and depending on who does the counting, which are actually very, very different. So, we sit here in the Gulf in the emirates of Dubai, which is part of the United Arab Emirates, one of the richest countries in the world. For all intents and purposes, actually a very, very developed country. But another country in MENA is it's Egypt, right? More than 100 million people. But it's actually kind of more in the range of developing countries as opposed to kind of developed countries and everything that kind of comes with it. Kind of from the level of sophistication and maturity of the markets to the level if we are talking about digital economy, you know, the penetration of mobile phone, Internet, payment, payment cards and so on and so forth. It's a very, very diverse region that actually needs a lot of different recipes, if you will, to kind to be, "flexible business". So, that was my role when I joined Google. So, we were actually very well established here in the UAE, but we didn't have a very, very meaningful footprint in the rest of the region, right? So, when I started doing my regional head of new markets, I went segue being head. Basically my assignment was essentially to kind of bring everything that we were able to build here in the UAE and to kind of take it further out into the rest of the region. And that I mean, at the end, you have the responsibility of looking at both the emerging markets, but also at the developed markets and playing all these different hats. Because for every region, it's not just about the penetration of the technology, but it's also about the culture. And it's about how much do they trust the payment system, how much do they trust digital e-commerce. And there's a lot of different subtleties that you really have to take into account. Even to the extent I think, covid is kind of an interesting. And we're probably going to talk about that a little bit. But even in terms of how you do business, right? Like in some parts of the region, some countries in the region, for them, the working culture is much more face to face oriented. There is no way for you to do business unless you have kind of first established a relationship. Unless you have actually gone a small chitchat and so on, unless you have gone and kind of had coffee with them. Yeah. And so on and so forth. So, a lot of times we think about the way that we do business in kind of develop countries that we're like, well, you know, we're going to an efficient way. We'll just jump on a call and kind of get things done. Well, that's not typically how things work in a lot of other countries in the region. You kind of need to be sensitive to all of these nuances if you want to actually be successful. 100%. I'm used to the fast paced modeling in San Francisco. If I'm getting 15 minutes with somebody from [--] and I have those first three minutes to make the impression. Here one of the first things they told me when I came to Dubai, they said, "Michael, before you mention anything that has to do with technology, with investments, whatever, sit down, have a chat, have a coffee, invest the time in the relationship, otherwise, nobody wants to do business." It's a very different mentality. Do most people fail that or do most people understand and make that quick adaptation? Because the world is getting globalized, right? Right now, it still feels a little bit fragmented just by the shock factor that I've exhibited coming here. But if I'm looking five, 10 years, even with the normalization with Israel, things are going to become more connected. So, how do you expect people are going to adapt this more business mindset within two sides? Yes. So, Dubai is great, I think in this regard. And again, I don't know how well known that is outside of kind of this this more narrow region. But Dubai is like a true melting pot, right? It's like, 190 nationalities. If you think about the population segmentation, if you will, again, I don't know how many people know that, but out of three million people in Dubai, less than 10% are the UAE nationals. 10%? Less than 10% are UAE nationals, right. Wow. So, if you think about the likelihood of you actually bumping into somebody who's kind of from another country is like nine out of 10. And in all likelihood, they're going to be from the subcontinent, they're going to be from Southeast Asia, they're going to be from Europe or the UK, less so from the US and Latin America. Just kind of from a geographic distance point of view. But I think the fact that it's a melting pot actually kind of gives rise to this kind of being kind of attuned, if you will, by the kind of more sensitive to the fact that a person sitting across from you in a business meeting is not going to be like you kind of from a cultural point of view. So, you may not necessarily understand their culture, but you're going to be naturally more attuned to kind of understand that it's different from yours. Right? And to kind of give them the benefit of the doubt, unnecessarily jump to conclusions, kind of get out of your way, kind of trying to basically kind of get get to learn a little bit more about, you know, how to be effective, how to establish those relationships, how to build them, how to get results, right at the end of the day. How do you explain what we're seeing here? How does it happen, as soon as I get to Dubai and seeing these crazy towers, people seem to be very happy, very low crime rate, you know, what's happening here? Why is Dubai this crazy melting pot and why do we have this? Well, I think the Dubai, the whole story of Dubai is really about, and you know, the way to think about Dubai is not even related to the MENA region. It's the way to think about it is kind of the headquarters of that hub, if you will, of a very, very broad region, which actually comprises almost two billion people. And the way that they've kind of set up and actually kind of started from the logistics. So, before Dubai was what it was in 1971, they've built what is to become one of the largest ports in the world, which is DP World in Jebel Ali which is like 20 miles down the road, right. And at that time, there was literally nothing. I mean, the Dubai, it was more like a fishing village with like 50 thousand people. But it was a vision to say that from a geographic point of view, it is a hub that is kind of logistically and distance wise within a seven to eight hour flight radius, to more than two billion people. So, it's a good place to put a port. And it turned out to be the case. It's a good place to actually put an airport in like an international airport. And today, Dubai International Airport is actually the largest international airport in the world. Actually. You've probably heard about Emirates Airlines. It's the biggest international airline in the world in terms of the number of connections, in terms of number of people. They're kind of transporting, hopping back and forth. So, think of Dubai as a hub. So, if you then think about that broader region that Dubai, the Dubai covers as a hub, you have places like India, you have places like Saudi Arabia, places like Dubai or places like, you know, southeast in the south and east to Eastern Europe, even to CIS countries, right, all kind of somewhat naturally gravitated towards a place that has established itself as not only a logistics hub, but also a hub that it is very convenient and very safe to do business in. Right? From the kind of safety and security perspective, but also kind of from a regulation perspective, because they put in a lot of kind of a very sort of regulatory framework around, you know, just kind of allowing it to do business with the rest of the region. Unbelievable. And so, you have a place of three million people, 90% of them are not even local, and it's become the hub of the region that encompasses two billion people. That's right. That's just unbelievable. I don't think that not even myself or many of my friends I have are actually understanding what's happening here. What's going to happen in the future? If you look at this, if you look at this whole region, MENA, the world with Dubai as a hub, what's going to happen 20 years down the line? Because the world is becoming more and more globalized. I've just experienced it now because the two nations are normalized. But what's going to happen in the future, do you think? Well, it's anyone's guess right, at the end of the day. But I think the vision, and we're talking about the pre-covid world, I think it remains to be seen what kind of adventures that the covid are going to throw into, everything is happening. But the whole underlying idea is that probably like, you know, from this kind of a grand vision perspective, we're probably not even like 30% there. Really? So, you know, again, like the emerging markets are the ones that are kind of up and coming. Right? And we can provide them with talent, technology, financial and regulatory framework. What London and New York have for the rest of the world, Dubai aspires to be for this kind of part of the world in between Hong Kong and London. So, all of these things, I think they've just scratched the surface of. If you think about what is happening in Africa, for example, which is projected to have more than one, one and a half billion people, right, all kind of emerging from poverty and at some point, if these economies kind of start picking up, Dubai is perfectly positioned to actually kind of leverage and kind of profit to all of that. So, I think the vision still stands. Again, covid and financial crisis, they're kind of throwing a couple of wrenches. But if you think about the macro trends, and if those macro trends continue, I think Dubai is very well-positioned to benefit from that. That's interesting. And I know that you have to go to, you have a hard stop soon. But I have to understand a little bit about the tech ecosystem with investments. So, right now, you're leading chief development officer, part of STV Saudi. Technology Ventures, yeah. Saudi Technology Ventures. So, you are investing all across the Middle East and North Africa. Give me a little bit of an overview. Because I know Silicon Valley pretty well, I know the United States and I know Tel Aviv. I don't know this region. What's happening here in terms of technology? And how does it fare in comparison to more of the Western world on what's happening there? Yeah. So, listen, the market here in kind of from a startup point of view is super nascent, right? So, I'll give you just one way to think about it, right. In terms of the overall amount of venture funding, US probably stands at around 100 billion, give or take. Right? Places like India are at around 10 to 12 billion, give or take a year. We are probably hitting our one billion mark over this year. So, kind of from an order of magnitude perspective, it's still super small and very, very nascent. And there are a number of reasons for that. I think one of the big reasons for that is that the economies here, historically were essentially driven by large organizations, right? By the extraction of hydrocarbons, obviously large companies in the world. Saudi Aramco is kind of the oil company that extracts oil from the ground and so on and so forth. A lot of things here also from an economic point of view are driven by trade, which is dominated by the large family of conglomerates and all that. So, if you think about SME or kind of this whole kind of sentiment around, starting from the ground up and having this kind of a entrepreneurial mindset, if you will, in kind of making it big in the world, it wasn't necessarily at present, the best here, right? The regulations were not supporting it either. The culture was not supporting it either. You know, we kind of take for granted this whole kind of start fail fast, but then kind of were the scars of that failure is kind of a learning experience and kind of something that you are proud of, right? Here in this region, failure was associated, there was kind of a negative connotation to it, right? So, from a cultural point of view, regulatory point of view, economic point of view, it wasn't a place where, you know, startups or the kind of the emergent kind of ecosystem economy would thrive. All of this is changing and all of this is changing super, super fast. Right? So, again, I've told you about the one billion dollar mark in venture funding, but it's actually kind of on the back of 50 million that was invested only five years ago. So, it's literally kind of an, it's getting kind of exponential growth. And the reason for me to actually move from Google to a place like STV, with all the branding differences and obviously kind of the safety and all the other differences is kind of looking at that opportunity as super nascent opportunity. Right? Essentially, I was telling myself was, you know, do I want to be there not only to witness it, but potentially participate in it and enable it? And the clear answer is yes. And basically, I told myself I was probably too late to do that in the Silicon Valley back in 2006. But I think I'm probably not too late here. Because it's just starting. I wanted to kind of make a good use of that. See the exponential curve. Ivan, I know we have to go. And this is a, I'm keeping you very late. But thank you so, so much for joining me on this show. It's really wonderful. And I'm so excited to share this with my friends, with my family. And I already learned so much. Ivan, before we leave, I have to ask you the most difficult question, which I didn't prepare you for. So, I'm sorry, but I need three words that you would use to describe yourself or anybody at STV or in MENA region would describe Ivan as. Interesting. Father. Yeah. I'm a father of three. Three boys that I'm very proud of. You wanted two and a half. So, one of them-- I wanted two and a half, I really wasn't sure if I would have ended up on on one side or the other. I think the second one is passionate. Passionate about helping people, passionate about educating people, passionate about growing people. And the third one would be, it's kind of related to the first one, but it's family, really. And not only my immediate family, but also my broader family as well. I love it. Ivan, Thank you so much. Elbow bump. Say hi to everyone at Stanford for me, please. Will do, thank you.
