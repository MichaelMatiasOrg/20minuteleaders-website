1
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,800
Wonderful.

2
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,720
Amy Vetter, thank you

3
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,600
for being on my show.

4
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,640
How are you?

5
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,120
Great.

6
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,560
Well, thanks for having me.

7
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,520
Really, really great to have you.

8
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,800
I'm very excited for this.

9
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
I think that it's going to be fascinating

10
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,520
to hear about your journey

11
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,880
from being an accountant

12
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,040
to discovering yoga.

13
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,720
And now, impacting a lot of people's lives

14
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,000
through your presentations, your books.

15
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,720
You've won multiple awards,

16
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
multiple TEDx speaker.

17
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,600
So I'm very very excited

18
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,760
to mainly get to know you better

19
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,160
and learn a little bit about

20
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,480
how you came to where you came to,

21
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,360
and what drove you to those areas.

22
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,200
So, maybe you can take me

23
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,120
all the way back to your accounting days.

24
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,680
And who's Amy Vetter,

25
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,200
and what are you all about?

26
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,880
So, I would say,

27
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,760
all the way back in my accounting days,

28
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,640
I didn't know who Amy Vetter was.

29
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,880
So, I had my grandfather was a CPA.

30
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,520
And from a very young age,

31
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,160
I was saying I was going to be a CPA

32
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,920
because I had known

33
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,040
my grandfather was a CPA.

34
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,240
For everybody who's listening, a CPA is?

35
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,000
A certified public accountant.

36
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,680
Okay. Which means it's for individuals.

37
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,080
You are helping individuals

38
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,840
file their taxes and about their money?

39
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,600
It can be for businesses.

40
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,480
So, a certified public accountant

41
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,520
can do audit.

42
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,840
Where you're auditing companies.

43
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,360
Where you are doing tax returns.

44
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,720
It can be for the individuals as well.

45
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,400
So, like you just said,

46
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,160
at 12 years old,

47
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,800
how would you know what a CPA meant?

48
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,800
So, I basically was doing it

49
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,080
because I was being told about it

50
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,400
and that was my path and my journey.

51
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
So, I was very focused on that.

52
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,760
At the same time, when I was younger

53
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,560
through high school,

54
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,440
I painted, I played violin and viola.

55
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,680
I was very artistic.

56
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,880
But once business school

57
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,960
and accounting school

58
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,520
and your early career comes up,

59
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,040
I have to let those things go

60
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,600
because the total focus

61
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
was being successful.

62
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,280
And the career that I had chosen.

63
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,800
And that's one of the reasons I say,

64
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,760
like starting out in your career,

65
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,280
I don't know

66
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,320
that you really know who you are.

67
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,800
You think you know who you are.

68
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,160
You think you know who you want to be

69
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,840
until you hit these moments in your career

70
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,080
of you achieve certain milestones

71
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,040
that you wanted to achieve.

72
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,520
And then you're like, wait,

73
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,480
am I happy,

74
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
are these the things

75
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,400
that I really wanted.

76
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,160
Did I even question what I wanted,

77
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,040
explore what I wanted.

78
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,960
So, when was that moment for you?

79
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,880
When I became a partner in a CPA firm.

80
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,920
So, that was a moment

81
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,560
I've been working toward.

82
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,280
I was 32.

83
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,920
And when I became partner,

84
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,000
that was a moment of like, wow,

85
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,520
I'm not as happy as I thought I would be.

86
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,320
And I really started doing

87
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,240
a lot of assessment.

88
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,040
I had started yoga at that time,

89
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,360
mainly because,

90
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,040
after I had my second child, I got sick.

91
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,600
So, I wasn't allowed to do

92
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,480
many of the types of workouts

93
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,480
I was used to doing.

94
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,360
So, I was only allowed to do yoga.

95
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,040
And as a type A personality,

96
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,560
that wasn't an answer I really wanted,

97
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,600
but I started really enjoying it.

98
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,240
But also it was very painful for me.

99
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,760
Like I go to a yoga class and cry

100
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,480
and not know

101
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,160
where that was even coming from.

102
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,640
Wow.

103
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,040
But then I'd keep coming back.

104
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,160
And I think there's a lot of fear

105
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,080
around practices like that

106
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,480
because you're alone with your mind.

107
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,640
And then it starts taking you places

108
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,840
and you have to explore it.

109
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,720
And you become a researcher of yourself.

110
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,240
And that really became

111
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,320
the beginning of my journey.

112
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,280
I also started seeing a therapist

113
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,560
at that time of my life,

114
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,000
which I think is really important.

115
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,520
We often talk about business coaches

116
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,760
and things that are professional.

117
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,720
But not necessarily the personal coaches,

118
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,520
therapists, things that we need as well.

119
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,680
From an emotional perspective,

120
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,240
that's an outside.

121
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,600
For a long time I've been saying that,

122
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,760
people go to the gym

123
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,720
three or four times a week

124
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,600
to work on their body.

125
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,160
But they're not even willing

126
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,320
to spend an hour to go talk to a person,

127
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,480
to work on them,

128
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,040
on their inner muscles, right?

129
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,440
So, I completely resonate

130
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,920
with what you're saying.

131
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,880
But going back to this idea

132
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,240
of being a research on your own journey.

133
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,320
So, you're starting this out

134
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,800
when you're having these doubts

135
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,560
as you're entering a partnership

136
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,680
within a large CPA firm.

137
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,200
Now, I'm trying to continue

138
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,960
to bring this back

139
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,800
to young entrepreneurs and engineers,

140
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,560
especially in the environment that I'm in,

141
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,800
whether it's at university

142
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,240
or in the workforce.

143
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,440
In Palo Alto,

144
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,120
things are moving very very fast, right?

145
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,800
Things can get very very hectic

146
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,360
17, 18 hour days.

147
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,440
The progressions seem to be

148
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,600
with no limit in the sky.

149
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,720
As long as you're willing to work

150
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,960
very hard for them.

151
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,520
So, how is it possible for somebody,

152
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,400
I mean, so first of all,

153
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,000
should we be more introspective

154
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,520
do you think, earlier on,

155
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,440
before we had that partnership

156
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,680
where we then start to question things?

157
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,160
Or is it okay to work very very hard

158
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,280
to that and then discover

159
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,440
whether it fits us or not?

160
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,320
Wow, there's a lot in that.

161
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,360
And there's something you said

162
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,040
that I want to stop,

163
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,120
so, I stop and pause on is,

164
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,280
I've worked in the software industry

165
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,920
in Palo Alto, Silicon Valley,

166
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,200
that whole area for many many years.

167
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,720
And when you say success comes fast

168
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,960
and people are working really hard,

169
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,960
success crashes fast, too.

170
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,480
And so, if you are not taking time

171
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,920
to really get to know who you are

172
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,120
and your whole identity,

173
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,760
that success in quotes,

174
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,360
you're going to crash harder

175
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,840
if you don't know yourself at those times.

176
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,240
The other thing that's hard

177
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,120
about those companies

178
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,800
and also being an entrepreneur

179
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,680
and so forth,

180
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,320
and especially if you have a board

181
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
and you're taking investors,

182
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,440
is you're replaceable.

183
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,760
And so, you really have to have

184
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,760
an understanding of what makes you happy

185
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,000
besides the work.

186
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,120
And how you can define that for yourself.

187
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,480
And that's really what business balance

188
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,400
and bliss, what my own analogy is about.

189
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,760
The goal being bliss,

190
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,880
and bliss, as I define it,

191
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,840
is the maintenance of happiness.

192
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,680
And a lot of times

193
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,160
we look for outside reasons to be happy.

194
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,720
So, if we use your example,

195
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,360
it's getting the next funding

196
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,680
or the new growth customers

197
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,400
that you want,

198
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,200
or different milestones

199
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,480
you have at the software,

200
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,960
but that comes from the outside in.

201
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,920
Rather than trying to understand

202
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,360
what creates joy internally in your body

203
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,640
and how do you create that yourself

204
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,440
each day.

205
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,800
So, when things are bad,

206
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,440
how do you come back to that feeling

207
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,520
in your body.

208
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,920
So, it sounds like the analogy would be

209
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,800
that these outside,

210
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,920
these external forces,

211
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,880
are like drugs that are feeding off

212
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,480
of your need to use them to be happy.

213
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,680
But as long as you don't have

214
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,640
internal happiness,

215
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,360
you have to have those drugs

216
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
because you're not happy yourself.

217
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,600
Whereas in the idea of this bliss,

218
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,520
of maintaining happiness,

219
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,280
it's about how do you generate happiness

220
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,360
through your own inner life

221
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,440
with the things that you do have.

222
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,360
And you don't need to rely

223
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,520
on external sources, right?

224
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,840
Yeah. You identify

225
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,040
what creates happiness yourself,

226
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,160
not relying on other people,

227
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,560
other things,

228
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,480
where you can cultivate that.

229
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,000
And yoga doesn't have to be the thing.

230
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,520
Meditation doesn't have to be the thing.

231
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,200
You can try it.

232
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,480
If it works for you, great.

233
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,360
It can be running.

234
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,160
It can be knitting.

235
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,530
It could be taking pictures,

236
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,840
it could be art, listening to music,

237
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,120
reading, whatever that is.

238
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,720
But, or even going back to thinking

239
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,440
about the things

240
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,640
that when you were little,

241
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,920
like when I talked about playing violin

242
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,720
and viola and painting,

243
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,360
how do you bring some of those things

244
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,040
back in your life,

245
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,280
even if you don't have time to do it.

246
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,840
When you go to a concert,

247
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,800
when you go to an art gallery

248
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,480
and look at other people's paintings

249
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,520
and maybe take an art class.

250
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,880
It's things like that to get your mind

251
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,920
and when you release your mind like that,

252
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
you actually are better at work

253
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,840
because you start coming up with ideas

254
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,960
just by having that time away.

255
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,000
Right. Right.

256
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,200
So, then talk to me a little bit

257
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,480
about your experience with yoga.

258
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,800
And what did yoga do to you

259
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,120
that helped you achieve that sort of,

260
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,600
or be on your journey

261
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,440
to achieve bliss?

262
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,160
Well, and I think, like anything,

263
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,840
you have to be ready

264
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,600
for something like that in your life.

265
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,240
And maybe it happens accidentally

266
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,200
like it did for me.

267
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,280
But then, I kept walking toward it

268
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,000
rather than getting scared off of it,

269
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,800
where it was initially about exercising.

270
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,080
And then it started becoming so much more

271
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,480
that I was able to apply it to my life.

272
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,640
And it was really

273
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,360
getting through those hard moments of,

274
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,360
number one, I was never a dancer.

275
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,120
I was never anyone

276
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,480
that can move their body.

277
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,040
Like you went into a yoga class

278
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,560
and you're like,

279
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,360
wow, look at the stuff they're doing.

280
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,400
And I had to let that go off.

281
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,880
I am okay if I'm not perfect at this.

282
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,160
This is not what, it's my career.

283
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,280
It's a little hard

284
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,920
for a type A personality to do.

285
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,040
Totally.

286
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,720
And part of the problem as an adult,

287
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
whatever you choose,

288
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,000
whether it's yoga or something else,

289
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,980
is we expect to be perfect at it

290
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,520
at the moment we walk in,

291
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,840
versus we know even in our own careers,

292
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,720
it took us a long time to be good

293
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,920
at what we're doing

294
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,520
and to develop that expertise.

295
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,800
So, we have to have patience

296
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,800
with ourselves to learn that new skill

297
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,560
and not be hard on ourselves.

298
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,800
And that's a really hard thing to do.

299
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,880
But when we learn to do it

300
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,920
outside of work,

301
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,360
it's something we can bring

302
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,720
into work as well,

303
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,760
that not only helps us,

304
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,400
but helps us as a leader

305
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,320
with the people around us, too.

306
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,480
Right. And talk to me a little bit

307
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,880
about the books that you've written

308
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,160
about these subjects,

309
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,720
and about these different experiences.

310
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,920
Yeah. So, I really came up

311
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,160
with business balance and bliss

312
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,800
just to make it a simplified way to think

313
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,440
about anything that you want

314
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,560
to put in your life.

315
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,440
Because they're buckets, right?

316
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,440
The business side is

317
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,080
all the stressors we have, anxiety,

318
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,520
fear, deadlines, procrastination.

319
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,840
You name what your issue is.

320
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,080
Everybody's got something, right?

321
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,120
And we're facing it every day.

322
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,080
Could be other people we work with

323
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,960
that we have trouble with at work,

324
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,200
whatever it may be.

325
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,040
And it's important that we offset it.

326
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,720
So, it's business plus balance

327
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,600
equals bliss.

328
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,520
And the balance side of this

329
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,960
is mindfulness and collaboration tools.

330
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,080
So, it's our human toolbox.

331
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,560
The things that we can do ourselves

332
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,240
to offset those stressors.

333
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,800
So, whether that means

334
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,960
better time management with our calendar,

335
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,720
taking breaks during the day

336
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,400
to walk or breathe or listen to music

337
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,520
or whatever we have to do.

338
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,160
Or learning how to listen better to others

339
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,000
and not speak to over the people

340
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,400
that we're working with.

341
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,280
All of the things

342
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,160
that we can put in place ourselves

343
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,480
without blaming the outside world

344
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,200
in order to create bliss.

345
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,240
That maintenance of happiness internally

346
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,480
by the things that we can control,

347
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,280
not expecting other people

348
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,680
to make that shift for us.

349
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,840
So, why is the business

350
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,480
is such a big part of it?

351
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,680
So, I get the balance and the bliss parts.

352
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,720
But why do you think business

353
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,240
is an important part of this formula?

354
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,880
Because I think that many people,

355
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,600
if you speak to them,

356
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,600
they're going to blame their job,

357
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,600
their family members, the coworkers.

358
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,280
This is why I don't feel good.

359
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,680
I've got this really bad boss.

360
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,480
Or, I'm working like crazy hours

361
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,600
and I'm so tired and I'm so stressed out.

362
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,400
And that all these things that we say

363
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,880
are the stressors in our life,

364
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,600
that's the bucket.

365
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,720
But we actually have the opportunity

366
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,120
to control some of these things

367
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,480
if we choose to

368
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,320
and not let the outside world control us.

369
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,960
And that's really the empowering thing

370
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,040
is once we start practicing,

371
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,280
they are little things,

372
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,640
but once we start practicing them

373
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,400
on a day to day basis,

374
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,040
they start becoming natural.

375
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,960
And that's breaking a habit, right?

376
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,040
Like if even just saying every single day

377
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,680
to your coworkers and friends

378
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,160
how stressed you are,

379
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,320
how much you don't like your boss

380
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:17,720
or whatever,

381
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,480
what if you just stop saying that.

382
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,440
How would that change

383
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,040
how you felt each day.

384
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,280
And maybe change the energy

385
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,600
that you were putting out

386
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,800
with the people around you

387
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,840
and to your boss.

388
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,840
That might make a little shift.

389
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,400
You never know.

390
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,440
So, it's these things

391
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,400
that we can identify ourselves

392
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,200
that can shift those stressors.

393
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,520
So, I'd also have to touch

394
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,600
a little bit about impacts.

395
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
And I understand,

396
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,800
especially in these worlds,

397
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,760
a lot of the coaching

398
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,640
that happens one on one

399
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,800
has a lot of direct impact

400
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,600
on the person that is learning.

401
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,440
You might be helping a CEO

402
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,320
or an executive go through their life

403
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,880
and think through with them

404
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,600
how they can help make these adjustments

405
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,800
to be a little bit happier.

406
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,360
But now, I'm wondering on a larger scale.

407
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,440
Because you've given countless talks

408
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,480
and keynotes and TEDx presentations,

409
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,120
and so many different people

410
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,160
were impacted by them.

411
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,400
Is there a way for you to know the impact

412
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,480
that you're having on them?

413
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,040
Or how do you even resonate

414
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,400
with a large crowd

415
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,080
as you're talking about these big ideas

416
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,840
where every person is trying to adjust

417
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,560
into their own life?

418
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,480
Well, I think the way,

419
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,680
my style is telling some of my own stories

420
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,400
so that people

421
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,760
can internalize that themselves.

422
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,880
So, when I am authentic and vulnerable

423
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,440
and telling things that aren't necessarily

424
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,880
great stories about myself

425
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,680
or when I had hard times,

426
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,240
other people can as well.

427
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,880
And I think part of the world problem,

428
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,920
is we only see the outside of people.

429
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,720
And so, people can make assumptions

430
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,760
all day long about me or you and and say,

431
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,640
"Oh, their life's seem perfect."

432
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,520
Or, things just come easy for them.

433
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,920
And when they learn the stories

434
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,320
behind the person,

435
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,120
then you become more real.

436
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,880
And it's no different

437
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,560
when you go back into the workplace.

438
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,480
And instead of looking at everyone

439
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,880
from the outside,

440
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,560
how could you get to know someone

441
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,120
from a more human standpoint.

442
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,760
And from a speaking perspective,

443
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,480
I can't know every single person

444
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,080
that I make an impact with.

445
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,840
But what I do know is

446
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,760
the people that come and talk to me

447
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,600
or message me after

448
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,040
or that end up wanting to the,

449
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,840
I have an online learning program

450
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,080
that helps them actually

451
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,320
implement this in their lives.

452
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,320
The people that want

453
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,880
to take those actions.

454
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,640
But I've seen many people

455
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,640
post the things that they went back

456
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,160
and started playing guitar again,

457
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,640
or painting again or doing these things

458
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,080
because they got inspired to go do it.

459
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,000
And that is what keeps my fire going

460
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,760
because I'm like,

461
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,720
Okay, then what I'm doing is worth it.

462
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,560
That it's helping others.

463
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,000
But it has to come from,

464
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,960
I think a very authentic place.

465
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:13,920
It's not that the goal is the career,

466
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,360
and I think that's the big shift

467
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,840
after your thirties.

468
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,960
It's about purpose.

469
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,200
And if you're younger

470
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,160
and you don't have purpose

471
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,560
behind what you're doing,

472
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,640
it can become very empty.

473
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,640
And so the earlier you can really identify

474
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,040
your purpose and passion,

475
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,280
and if the work you're doing

476
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,400
is aligning with that

477
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,520
or if you feel out of alignment,

478
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,640
then what can you do to fill in that gap.

479
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,800
So, what is one tangible thing

480
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,080
that I can take with me

481
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,400
as I go into the office tomorrow

482
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,040
and try to implement

483
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,960
some of this more well-rounded,

484
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,920
balanced thinking

485
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,440
and internal introspection?

486
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,720
What can and should I do

487
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,480
throughout my day or throughout my week

488
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,840
to make it a little bit easier for me?

489
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,160
Well, and many aren't going

490
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,320
into offices right now

491
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,640
and we're not in meetings

492
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,480
and so forth,

493
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,520
so, I think what's really important

494
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,360
is how you man your calendar, first off.

495
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,760
So, I'm really a big believer

496
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,640
that a meeting

497
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,200
does not have to be 30 minutes.

498
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,480
It can be 25

499
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,760
or instead of an hour, 50 minutes.

500
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,200
So, you can build in breaks

501
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,440
in between meetings to decide

502
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,760
what you want to do on those breaks.

503
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,000
And I call it at least taking two minutes

504
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,440
to either meditate, to get up,

505
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,200
walk around, do some stretches,

506
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,040
listen to music,

507
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,240
whatever you need to do.

508
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,960
So that you don't leave one meeting

509
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,400
and then let that snowball

510
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,720
into the next meeting.

511
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,520
And then by the end of the day,

512
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,200
you're so stressed out or frustrated,

513
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,600
you don't even know if the frustration

514
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,200
is from that person

515
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,880
or if it's just the snowballing

516
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,560
from the day.

517
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,640
Totally. And I can imagine that now,

518
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,600
during covid, that everything is so quick.

519
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,920
And right after this meeting,

520
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,920
I go and I answer all these messages

521
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,880
with the one minute I have

522
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,200
before joining the next Zoom call.

523
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,640
So, it's a little bit crazy.

524
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,760
Which part of your job

525
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,600
do you enjoy most?

526
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,680
Is it the writing, the speaking,

527
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,400
the meeting, the online learning,

528
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,760
what is it?

529
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,200
I love what I do.

530
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,440
I don't have, I mean,

531
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,600
speaking, I would say obviously,

532
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,080
is the number one thing I love to do

533
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,080
because I love the light bulbs going on.

534
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,240
And you can see the impact immediately

535
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,400
where some of the others

536
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
is the longer term thing.

537
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,400
But I really love interacting with people.

538
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,680
So, most of my job is that.

539
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,320
I love it. Okay, Amy, first of all,

540
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,640
I want to thank you for being so generous

541
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,080
with your time and for being on the show.

542
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,080
I truly appreciate it.

543
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,360
I know how busy you are.

544
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,520
And the last question that I want to ask,

545
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,440
the most important one and fun one

546
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,960
are three words that you would use

547
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,080
to describe yourself.

548
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,040
And why those three specific words.

549
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,680
I know you gave me till the end.

550
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,880
So, I'm a mother, first off.

551
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm very proud of the two boys I have

552
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,080
that are teenagers.

553
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,360
Confidence, that I think

554
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,960
that it has helped me a great deal,

555
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,160
to be able to take on risks

556
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,360
and opportunities

557
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,200
and go through failures as well

558
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,040
when needed

559
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,360
and go through the hard times.

560
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,080
And I would say loyal to the people

561
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,400
that have been good to me back.

562
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,040
Like that I have

563
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,840
very long term relationships

564
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,360
and even knew people like,

565
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,000
I think anyone that is

566
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,160
in that circle of trust,

567
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,800
we have very strong, deep relationships.

568
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,360
I love it.

569
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,960
Amy, thank you very very much.

570
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,800
I truly appreciate it.

571
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,960
And continue to make a positive impact

572
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,440
on people.

573
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,480
Thank you very much.

574
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,000
Thank you.

575
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,280
Wonderful.
