73
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:20,880
All right.

74
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,240
Bing Hackman, thank you

75
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,360
for being on 20 Minute leaders.

76
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,600
How are you?

77
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,280
Terrific. Interesting times.

78
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,920
Interesting times, but you seem to be

79
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,040
in one of the nicest places in the world.

80
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,920
What is this background?

81
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,920
So this actually is

82
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,640
a background that you might be more likely

83
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,800
recognize. It's Yad Vashem

84
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,320
overlooking Israel.

85
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,000
Is this right

86
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,000
right at the entrance of Yad Vashem when -

87
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,560
The backside. The backside.

88
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,040
The entrance is closed, you go through it.

89
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,720
This is the backside there's a view.

90
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,880
So this is right after

91
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,800
you're in this dark room

92
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,560
and you see all the faces and all

93
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,400
the names and then you go out to the light

94
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,960
and you see the beauty of Israel.

95
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,440
Is that right?

96
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,800
The countryside.

97
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,320
Right.

98
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:02,960
Wonderful.

99
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,880
Well, Bing such a pleasure to have you.

100
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,600
Coming from an industry that

101
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
I really know nothing about.

102
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,120
Now, you don't really, you

103
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,960
deal with real estate

104
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
but you don't really deal with,

105
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,760
you know, a small apartment investment,

106
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,920
like I hope to be a part of

107
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,920
or that you know,

108
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,200
the average person deals with.

109
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,720
But you really deal with massive,

110
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,920
massive real estate considerations.

111
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,240
You mentioned a few

112
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,920
of them right before

113
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,600
but I'll let you take it away and tell me

114
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,160
a little bit about what it means

115
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,080
to you and how you've sort of

116
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,360
paved your way through this

117
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,120
and then we can move on to some other things

118
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,400
that we want to talk about.

119
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,000
Sure.

120
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,120
So I did feasibility studies for projects

121
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,840
for Stanford Research Institute,

122
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,560
SRI,

123
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,680
international private sector

124
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,440
shopping centers,

125
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,320
apartment buildings,

126
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,360
office buildings,

127
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,680
industrial -

128
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,720
The Monterey Bay

129
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,240
you told me, right?

130
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,400
Monterey Bay

131
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,040
Aquarium -

132
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,520
I love it -

133
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,920
... facilities, convention centers,

134
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,480
arenas, stadiums,

135
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,280
performing arts centers,

136
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,680
recreational facilities, Calgary,

137
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,760
different places.

138
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,640
Fort Dodge, Iowa.

139
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,720
A wide span.

140
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
Go into a community,

141
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,960
you learn all about it,

142
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,800
and you kind of understand it.

143
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,760
When you get into a more complex area,

144
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,120
L.A., San Francisco,

145
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,680
there's so much that goes on

146
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,040
it's a little bit harder to see.

147
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,360
Anyway, I went from there

148
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,280
MAI Appraiser.

149
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,760
Wait. Wait.

150
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,400
What is the feasibility tester?

151
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,960
What is that even mean?

152
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,600
So I look at other development.

153
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,960
I see what it costs to operate,

154
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,040
what it costs to build,

155
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,680
what revenues they generate.

156
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,360
And the feasibility

157
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,480
is having the revenues generated,

158
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,520
cover the cost to build

159
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,760
and create a profit.

160
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,560
So it's like you're gonna build

161
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,920
an apartment building.

162
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,600
You know, here's what it cost to build.

163
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,920
Here's the rent you're gonna get.

164
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,560
And so does it make sense,

165
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,440
does ... make sense?

166
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,360
So let's take for example,

167
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,880
the case study

168
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,680
of the Monterey Bay.

169
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,280
So you actually look at,

170
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,720
OK, what is this actual,

171
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,760
given the structure

172
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,120
that we want to build

173
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,280
and the prices,

174
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,680
how much is this gonna cost us?

175
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,200
And then you take a look at

176
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,960
the ticket sales and the projections

177
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,200
Simple story.

178
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,320
I looked at aquaria

179
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,320
all over the country

180
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,840
and I saw what the staffing was.

181
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,120
I saw what the use days were.

182
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,040
I saw what the traffic was.

183
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,240
I looked at the different types of

184
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,400
exhibits that had greater appeal.

185
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,680
I presented that to David Packard

186
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,920
and his daughter Julie,

187
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,560
who was a marine biologist

188
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,760
with ...

189
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,120
Marine Science Center next door.

190
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,680
And they looked and they said,

191
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,960
"That's all fine, but we're gonna go big"

192
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,920
So here's an idea of what

193
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,880
you're gonna get into

194
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,080
and then here's what they decided to do,

195
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,320
which is a wonderful thing.

196
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,920
So we gave them a foundation

197
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,920
base of the general expectation

198
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,480
and, you know, obviously they're pretty

199
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,320
capable and understanding, insightful.

200
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,760
And so then they chose to do what

201
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,520
they did, which was terrific.

202
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,080
Wow. That's incredible.

203
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,600
And it's a great setting, anchors a tourism area

204
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,720
made famous.

205
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,000
So, it's not just real estate.

206
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,880
It's really it's hard core economics work

207
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,440
to really understand all of the moving

208
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,400
pieces and whether this is

209
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,360
an economically viable opportunity.

210
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:09,840
That's right.

211
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,640
You look at what goes on elsewhere.

212
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,040
You understand that.

213
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,440
You see how it applies

214
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,920
and what kind of, you know,

215
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,400
in other types of properties,

216
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,560
what kind of market share in this one,

217
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,200
you know,

218
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,520
what kind of tourism is there

219
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,320
and how will that feed in?

220
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,280
So it's that kind of thing.

221
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,360
So I have to ask,

222
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,440
when you deal with projects that are,

223
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,600
you know, tens or hundreds

224
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,560
of millions of dollars,

225
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,000
how granular do you get in terms of the,

226
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,120
you know, the estimates?

227
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,840
So, for example, in this case,

228
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,600
how exact do you try to be

229
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,600
in estimating the potential revenue?

230
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,240
It's like an appraisal.

231
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,800
Again, after SRI,

232
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,280
I became an appraiser.

233
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,920
After becoming an appraiser,

234
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,800
I worked for a high net worth individual

235
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,280
and bought office, institutional quality,

236
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,920
opportunistic investments

237
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,760
in the Western states.

238
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,880
So, office

239
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,080
R&D, industrial properties

240
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,360
and in each case, just like an appraisal,

241
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,800
you're looking at the revenues,

242
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,640
the expenses and the returns.

243
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,400
And in acquisitions, you're looking,

244
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,280
you know, what are the risk issues?

245
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,520
I would find properties with a lease

246
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,040
expiration in three years.

247
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,120
It was too small for institutions,

248
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,360
too big for private.

249
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,920
My guy, he was perfect.

250
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,840
He has 40 of these, you know,

251
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,160
a couple of 'em roll out.

252
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,160
It's fine.

253
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,080
Anybody else?

254
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,160
If they only have one,

255
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,760
you know, they can't handle it.

256
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,280
So you find a strategy

257
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,440
that works a unique niche,

258
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,480
and each case is, there's a real world

259
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,360
operation that's similar.

260
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,680
And so you're comparing it

261
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,560
to those to find, you know,

262
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,720
what the value would be,

263
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,960
what the opportunity would be.

264
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,840
And in terms of granularity, you know,

265
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,880
appraisals, you know, they try to get

266
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,200
to be 90% accurate in their values.

267
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,240
Ninety five.

268
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,920
And there's a lot of variation,

269
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,800
a lot of subjectivity. Think about,

270
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,800
go look at a stock analyst

271
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,920
on any big company.

272
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,120
You're gonna see a range of opinions

273
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,920
that is stunningly broad.

274
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,960
And that's all subjective and they have

275
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,320
extensive information to draw from.

276
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,360
But, you know, you have

277
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
a variety of opinions.

278
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,160
And so with anything

279
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,400
that factors in there

280
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,240
but you hope to

281
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,880
get repeat business, so you try

282
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,000
to be reasonably on top of things.

283
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,680
Wonderful.

284
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,680
So, you worked for this individual

285
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,400
and then you move on

286
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,320
and then you mentioned MIA.

287
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,600
Right?

288
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,720
The Member of Appraisal Institute, MAI,

289
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,280
was after SRI

290
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,560
before acquisitions.

291
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,840
Lots of abbreviations

292
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,160
it gets complicated.

293
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,480
Yeah.

294
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,200
Now I'm working

295
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,800
with Colliers as a real estate broker.

296
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,640
I do investment sales

297
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,920
and I do help tenants.

298
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,440
I like helping tenants.

299
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,080
They need the help of other -

300
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,880
The landlords

301
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,280
have all the information.

302
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,520
Tenants are struggling to survive.

303
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,040
The rents are very high

304
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,080
and we try to, you know,

305
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,720
even, level the playing field a little bit.

306
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,520
Definitely.

307
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:07,880
Okay.

308
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,120
So, Bing an expert in economics.

309
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,160
Talk to me a little bit about

310
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,960
what's happening now,

311
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,240
because you know,

312
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,880
coming in at 24 and just

313
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,480
starting out my sort

314
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,160
of my economic life.

315
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,320
This is a pretty interesting time.

316
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:20,720
Yeah.

317
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,560
Give me a little bit of context about--

318
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,400
... backing up that

319
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,560
People have been saying

320
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,840
how awful things are and they've been

321
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,680
saying that for a period of years.

322
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,680
This is the best time to be born

323
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,320
in the history of the planet

324
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,760
and if you want to talk about

325
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,280
demo, work,

326
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,480
you want to talk about vision care.

327
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,400
You want to talk about opportunities to

328
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,520
raise a family and to get an education.

329
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,640
Right now, we have an unbelievably

330
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,480
unique time,

331
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,760
but we started out with a healthy market.

332
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,040
What people don't understand

333
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,880
is there's two and only two drivers

334
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,640
of long term GDP growth

335
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,560
and GDP isn't everything

336
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,120
but it's a central metric.

337
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,360
And those two drivers are

338
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,840
labor force growth and productivity.

339
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,600
So when somebody tells you

340
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,720
they're going to grow the economy

341
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,160
at 4%, they essentially have

342
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,880
no understanding of economics.

343
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,480
Short term, tax cut, spending,

344
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,640
whatever, you can blip it.

345
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,800
Long term, you have to have those two elements

346
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,360
and if you do, you'll have -

347
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,560
And again, one percent per year

348
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,880
with productivity,

349
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,760
one percent per year,

350
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,000
labor force, two percent

351
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,600
is a healthy GDP growth in the current world.

352
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,400
We're gonna go to 10 billion people,

353
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,560
we're at seven five,

354
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,480
then we're gonna shrink back down,

355
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,600
according to demographers

356
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,440
I'm not a demographer

357
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,080
that's what I hear.

358
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,960
But right now,

359
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,040
we have a good economic base.

360
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,400
We have a lot of pent up demand

361
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,680
that's going to express itself

362
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,840
once we get things wrapped up.

363
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,760
I don't know what the damage will be,

364
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,000
nobody really knows,

365
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,920
but we are incredibly fortunate.

366
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,720
And the thing that really strikes me,

367
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,320
really strikes me today,

368
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,280
is the opportunity

369
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,440
we have to see that

370
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,520
we're all in this together.

371
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,520
You know, I feel like we're in a time

372
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,140
of more intense tribalism

373
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,120
than I've ever felt.

374
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,040
Yeah. For sure.

375
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,440
And why?

376
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,720
You know, we should be advancing.

377
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,320
From an economic metrics point of view,

378
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,040
as I view it,

379
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,160
we're actually better off

380
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,240
compared to most of history.

381
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,520
We all have our thoughts on the topic.

382
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,370
But, you know, and I also note that

383
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:25,920
a healthy community

384
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,760
is different than tribalism.

385
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,080
But for me right now,

386
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,760
there is a profound lack of perspective.

387
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,040
So I'd like to talk about that a bit.

388
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,000
100%

389
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:36,640
All right.

390
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,800
Okay. So, let me just share something

391
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,560
on my screen here.

392
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:39,960
Please.

393
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,320
'cause this is, I think, tells a story.

394
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,600
Can you read that?

395
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,680
Yes, I can.

396
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,040
This is by Albert Einstein.

397
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,160
I think most people know who he was:

398
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,680
A human being is part of a whole

399
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,240
called by us the universe.

400
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,880
This is a part limited in time and space,

401
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,520
and he experiences himself, or she,

402
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,120
thoughts and feelings

403
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,000
as separated from the rest

404
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,080
And it's really kind of an optical

405
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,120
delusion of our consciousness,

406
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,280
as Einstein puts this.

407
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,120
This is a kind of delusion's

408
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,360
that really a prison for us.

409
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,080
So, we see ourselves

410
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,520
as separate and

411
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,160
at odds with each other,

412
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,800
and our task is to free ourselves

413
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:32,360
from this prison

414
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,720
by widening our circles of compassion,

415
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,040
embrace all living creatures,

416
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,160
the whole creation and its beauty.

417
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,840
This is the central theme of

418
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,200
pretty much every major tradition.

419
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,320
Right.

420
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,800
And this is the perspective that's lost.

421
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,600
We see our little silos.

422
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,160
We see our little tribes.

423
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,840
We don't see our ethical imperatives.

424
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,040
We don't see our connection.

425
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,520
Right.

426
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,440
And another great visionary,

427
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,040
Abraham Joshua Heschel,

428
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,920
"When I take the time to look,

429
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,400
there's wonder in the commonplace

430
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,240
and wonder is commonplace"

431
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,760
And I want to reflect on that

432
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,720
just a little bit.

433
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,120
For me, the big picture helps

434
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,360
put things in perspective,

435
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,720
by which I mean

436
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,240
if you took all visible matter in the universe -

437
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,480
big topic -

438
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,480
70% is hydrogen,

439
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,840
27%'s helium,

440
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,520
97% is stars.

441
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,120
The other 3% only

442
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,560
is all the other elements

443
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,800
on the periodic table.

444
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,480
Here we are,

445
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,480
on a carbon based speck of dust

446
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
in a Goldilocks orbit

447
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,520
around a heat source

448
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,800
on which there was an algae bloom

449
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,400
oxygenating the atmosphere

450
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,120
and we live in an oasis

451
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,240
on which life has spawned

452
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,120
in a incredibly hostile universe.

453
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,600
Right.

454
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,680
And we understand the magnitude of that gift

455
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,520
for you and I to have this conversation.

456
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,200
For us to raise a family

457
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,720
or to pursue whatever we might.

458
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,320
That is a perspective that I think is sorely lacking.

459
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,880
We're disconnected from nature.

460
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,760
We're disconnected from our connectedness.

461
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,120
Right.

462
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,560
And we're all part of the same.

463
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,000
And we're unique expressions of that,

464
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,480
but we're distorted expressions of that.

465
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,280
You know, all great traditions

466
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,080
helped to reduce our distortion.

467
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,200
What do they want it to do?

468
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,360
The common theme is seeing and feeling

469
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,880
everything and everyone as sacred.

470
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,440
Can you imagine if we all felt and saw

471
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,440
each other and this oasis in that light?

472
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,280
And it's again expanding

473
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,840
our circles of compassion.

474
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,040
Another thing that's important

475
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,240
is to have a sense of the magnitude

476
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,040
of our ignorance,

477
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,880
our silos and our echo chambers.

478
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,480
This is a Gallup poll

479
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,320
that I've looked at

480
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,440
for 10 years,

481
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,000
running and it repeats each year

482
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,000
the same outcome.

483
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,840
Gallup,

484
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,480
I still don't believe this

485
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,400
but look it up.

486
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,040
The percent of adults in America

487
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,000
that believe in creationism,

488
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,840
the earth is 10,000 years old

489
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,520
creationism,

490
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,440
40% in America.

491
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,520
So, we have,

492
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,760
40% of Americans

493
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,240
believe that the earth is 10,000 years old.

494
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,200
Yeah.

495
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,520
And, you know, obviously,

496
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,520
we've lost our faith in science.

497
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,480
It's a lot of chaos.

498
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,560
We're emotional beings and creatures.

499
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,840
And so what do we do?

500
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,560
You know, that's the big question.

501
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,720
Well, we start with really looking

502
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,680
at our actions

503
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,440
and our interactions

504
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
with others around us.

505
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,440
A major theme, again,

506
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,320
of all traditions.

507
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,600
I'm gonna start with Amos.

508
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,120
That book of the Bible is like 750 BC

509
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,480
So add 2000 to that,

510
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:49,490
2800 years ago.

511
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,520
They were saying

512
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,480
righteousness and justice

513
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,000
is what's paramount.

514
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,040
And then you go to,

515
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:58,680
I don't know,

516
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,360
let's say 350 BCE is

517
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,920
when Plato wrote The Republic,

518
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,240
which centered as a theme justice

519
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,280
and why is it that nice guys finish last?

520
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,880
Why is this?

521
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,600
Why is that?

522
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,000
But it was also the

523
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,000
great appreciation of reason.

524
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,720
But we remain emotional beings.

525
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,000
But justice is a central theme,

526
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,440
and it's really an ethical imperative

527
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,760
for all major traditions.

528
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,160
Right.

529
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,160
So what's happening?

530
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,320
Let's understand this a little bit.

531
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,040
I took a course in religious literacy

532
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
and people understand

533
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,240
violence as direct violence.

534
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,120
But violence is more than that.

535
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,120
It's structural violence

536
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,080
and it's cultural violence.

537
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,920
So what do I mean by that?

538
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,640
If you are suppressing opportunities,

539
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,680
you are creating structural violence.

540
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,160
If you're vilifying,

541
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,640
if you're demeaning,

542
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,640
you're creating cultural violence.

543
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,520
And you know most would be appalled

544
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,720
at direct violence.

545
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,360
If you had,

546
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:02,880
you know,

547
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,200
police showing up with police dogs

548
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,160
and fire hoses

549
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,520
and running people down

550
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,440
who were peacefully protesting.

551
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,450
Right.

552
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,040
That would be appalling.

553
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,720
But people are not appalled.

554
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,000
They're insensitive

555
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,240
to cultural violence

556
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,760
and structural violence,

557
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,200
which are just as egregious.

558
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,960
We need to better understand how we

559
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,000
contribute individually,

560
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,440
directly and indirectly.

561
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,960
Think of the Black Lives Matter.

562
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,400
The southerners used the Bible

563
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,000
to justify slavery.

564
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,240
And sacred texts

565
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,080
are for revealing and inspiring

566
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,400
a sense of the sacred.

567
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,040
To use sacred texts to justify

568
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,320
exploitation, historical claims, oppression,

569
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,680
it's an egregious violation

570
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,760
of the second commandment,

571
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,800
one of the foundations of

572
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,880
humanity's aspirations.

573
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,720
There's a very,

574
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,080
I'm gonna repeat that actually.

575
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,000
Sacred text are for revealing,

576
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,520
inspiring a sense of the sacred.

577
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,240
To use sacred texts

578
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,320
to justify exploration,

579
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,320
historical claims or oppression,

580
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,560
is a horrific violation

581
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,440
of the second commandment.

582
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,520
And you know, if we learn nothing

583
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,320
from history,

584
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,320
such sacrilege by religious zealots

585
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,800
has been the cause of many wars

586
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,240
and much suffering.

587
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,320
So what's the lens

588
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,160
that we want to look at?

589
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm going to quote

590
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,000
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin

591
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,680
he was a Jesuit.

592
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,040
"The way we treat people

593
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,320
is the way we treat God"

594
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,400
Very clear.

595
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,120
Think of trauma.

596
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,800
You have an oppressed situation.

597
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,080
There's great trauma in that.

598
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,240
And that trauma compounds

599
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,880
if you have opportunity.

600
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,560
It's like having a dollar.

601
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,800
It grows, it invests,

602
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,800
and it grows over time.

603
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,720
If you don't,

604
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,240
you have a cycle of poverty

605
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,400
that cannot be broken.

606
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,520
Vilifying others is cultural violence.

607
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,480
Condoning and supporting it is, too,

608
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,880
even if only indirectly

609
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,160
Constraining opportunities of others

610
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,920
is structural violence.

611
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,560
Separating others,

612
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,320
limiting or preventing

613
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,680
exposure and interaction

614
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,400
causes cultural violence to fester.

615
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,760
Conversely, facilitating exposure contact

616
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,240
reduces cultural violence

617
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,760
that builds bridges.

618
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,220
We need bridges, not walls.

619
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,240
A quote that I'm gonna cite

620
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,160
is really a beautiful one.

621
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,960
It's from Kurt Tucholsky

622
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,520
"A country is not what it does.

623
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,840
It's also what it tolerates"

624
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,800
And, you know, we've probably heard

625
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,600
Micah and there's a very famous,

626
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,440
you know, I guess verse, book

627
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,960
Micah 6:8

628
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,640
"He has told you, O mortal, what is good

629
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,800
and what does the Lord require of you

630
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,040
but to do justice,

631
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,120
love kindly,

632
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,640
and walk humbly

633
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,960
with your God"

634
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:14,970
And to me,

635
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,760
this perspective, connection with nature,

636
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,120
connection with the being

637
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,040
that we're all part of,

638
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,800
and seeing each other as a part of that

639
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,680
is something we need to move toward.

640
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,640
No, no Bing I completely agree.

641
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,840
I would love to you ask a few questions.

642
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,680
Do you mind stopping the screen share

643
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,120
just so that I can see you again?

644
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,960
And I think that really

645
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,200
what I'm what I'm curious about,

646
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
and I think it's extraordinary

647
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,320
how much thought

648
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,040
and meaning you put into this.

649
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,240
What I'd love to know is

650
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,320
where does this all come from?

651
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,080
So, you know, coming from economics,

652
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,000
working on really incredible,

653
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,000
incredible deals.

654
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,280
What brings you to be so passionate about

655
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,360
this idea of our mutual responsibility

656
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,960
to be kind to each other

657
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,640
and to be part of this creation?

658
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,080
Where does it all stem from?

659
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,200
Okay.

660
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,680
So I graduated college 100 years ago

661
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,680
and I had to decide what the heck am I going to do.

662
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,240
And so I started thinking,

663
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,560
Okay, gosh, I don't know.

664
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,000
It was back in the 60s.

665
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,160
I thoroughly enjoyed the 60s,

666
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,720
but that's another story.

667
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,240
But it was a time of reflection

668
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
and you know,

669
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,560
did I want to go into service,

670
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,440
did I wanna do this.

671
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,320
I want to do that.

672
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,960
Do I want to be a business person?

673
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,560
And I realized that what I need to do

674
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,360
to understand how to navigate

675
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,880
my life is to see what's important.

676
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,840
And to me, what's important is this:

677
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,320
what is the nature of creation

678
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,920
and our role in it.

679
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,040
And that theme has been with me

680
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,080
through these decades as a central

681
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,960
point to ponder in all the opportunities

682
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,440
that I've had.

683
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,960
And I lived in Los Angeles

684
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,240
and had numerous opportunities

685
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,720
to look at different traditions.

686
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,240
I've traveled the world, India, Israel,

687
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,480
wherever to look at centers

688
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,440
and meet with teachers

689
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,120
that I thought were helpful in some way.

690
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,720
We have such a cornucopia of resources.

691
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,000
It's absolute extraordinary.

692
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,000
So it's basically, you know,

693
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,000
my central journey.

694
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,320
The other things I do

695
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,960
certainly are practical.

696
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,280
I like to refer to it as practical misses.

697
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,040
I think that's where my surprise stems from

698
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,800
because, you are

699
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,720
a very practical guy.

700
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,160
I mean, there's economics

701
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,000
is one of most practical things,

702
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,800
I think to study unless you're a theorist.

703
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,880
But I think that it's still extraordinary.

704
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,720
And I, you know, we have just just

705
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,840
one minute left.

706
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,160
But I'd love to ask you my last

707
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,200
and favorite question,

708
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,680
which is three words

709
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,600
that you would best use

710
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
to describe yourself.

711
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,200
Well, as I think about it,

712
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,960
I thoroughly enjoy looking into things,

713
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,680
exploring.

714
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,520
And so I guess probably what I'd say

715
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,960
is I'm just a fascinated explorer.

716
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,000
I find it fascinating.

717
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,960
I'm fascinated by it.

718
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,440
And I can't think of anything

719
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,680
more interesting or exciting.

720
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,560
So I'm a fascinated explorer.

721
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,000
That's wonderful.

722
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,200
Okay.

723
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,640
So I'm gonna take that as two words

724
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,400
but I think that they're so grand and so,

725
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
you know, they can mean

726
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,280
every person can

727
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,400
interpret them in a different way

728
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,240
that it just alludes to more.

729
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,960
So I'll take that happily.

730
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,800
I put a word a in front

731
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:26,810
so that's three words.

732
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,080
You win.

733
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:28,960
It's wonderful.

734
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,240
Bing, thank you for the time.

735
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,200
And thank you for sharing your thoughts

736
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,360
on our mutual responsibility.

737
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,480
I think it's wonderful to have

738
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:37,960
both you know,

739
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,560
a very practical livelihood on one hand

740
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,680
but then thinking about

741
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,480
the larger picture things

742
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,440
and I love that you chose

743
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,440
the background of the view,

744
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,600
right out of Yad Vashem

745
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,200
with all the symbolics that it has with it.

746
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,240
And you know, some of the viewers of this

747
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,680
don't know necessarily about

748
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,880
Yad Vashem and what this represents,

749
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,200
but really it represents life after,

750
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,480
you know, the worst possible place

751
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,130
you can come from.

752
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
It's ... you know

753
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,280
I've been to Yad Vashem

754
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,160
quite a few times

755
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,680
and really it's an extraordinary feeling

756
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,960
coming out from this darkness

757
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,760
up and seeing this

758
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,160
this beautiful countryside.

759
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,400
And I think that our talk also resonates

760
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,360
a lot with this idea of

761
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,800
we're in a very difficult time,

762
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,360
but we can always step back

763
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,480
and look at the look at the beautiful

764
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,200
world that we live in

765
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
and what's our responsibility to maintain it.

766
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,280
Bing, thank you for the inspiration

767
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,200
And hopefully appreciate with wonder,

768
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,880
fascination and curiosity.

769
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:31,600
I love it.

770
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,480
The incredible gift that we have.

771
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:35,490
Thank you Bing.

772
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,520
Thank you very much.

773
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,400
Bye bye.
