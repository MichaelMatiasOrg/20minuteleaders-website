1
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,880
All right.

2
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,800
Steve Krawczyk, how are you doing?

3
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,600
Oh, great, great, Michael.

4
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,680
Wonderful to have you here.

5
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,520
How are you?

6
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,600
Good.

7
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,560
So, you're talking

8
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,960
from Silicon Valley now?

9
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,600
Yes, at Palo Alto.

10
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,320
Okay. So, right across the street.

11
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,800
Wonderful. But you're originally from,

12
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,760
actually in New York, from the East Coast.

13
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,120
Yeah. Originally from Poland.

14
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,720
But I got to the United States

15
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,400
when I was six.

16
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,400
So, essentially I grew up here.

17
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,360
Spent time growing up in New York.

18
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,400
I went to school there.

19
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,960
And then, when college,

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,160
I happened to I ended up

21
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,400
at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

22
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,960
And it has happened for nine years

23
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,900
and that's a little bit of a story.

24
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,480
So, Let's start over there.

25
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,360
Spending nine years

26
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,680
at University of Michigan.

27
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,600
Right. So, I was pretty early on,

28
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,560
I was  fascinated by chemistry

29
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,400
and especially medicinal chemistry.

30
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,520
How pharmaceuticals work

31
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,240
and things like that.

32
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,520
And so, I wanted to study

33
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,480
medicinal chemistry.

34
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:04,960
And there aren't

35
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,440
that many medicinal chemistry programs

36
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,360
in the country.

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,520
A really good one was

38
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,080
at the University of Michigan.

39
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,080
At the College of Pharmacy.

40
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,040
And it actually turned out to be

41
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,600
an incredible stroke of luck for me

42
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,080
to go there.

43
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,680
So, it was kind of interesting story.

44
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,720
I applied to a variety of schools.

45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,000
Michigan ended up being my first choice.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,320
I ended up going up there.

47
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,800
I got a work study job stipend.

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,760
And so, my first week on campus there

49
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,800
as an undergrad,

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,320
I went to the office look for jobs, I go,

51
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,640
"Oh, wow. Look, a lab assistant

52
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,840
at the College of Pharmacy."

53
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,280
"Perfect."

54
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,240
So, I go there Friday afternoon

55
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,280
and I meet the guy there and he says,

56
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,360
"Well, it's really cleaning rat cages

57
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,080
and that job is already taken. Sorry."

58
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,680
But he introduced me to this woman

59
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,120
who is doing like cell culture, biology,

60
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,200
drug testing and cell culture.

61
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,880
"I want you to go meet Linda."

62
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,520
So, he took me upstairs to introduce me

63
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,200
to this postdoc researcher,

64
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,040
Linda [--].

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
And she talk to me

66
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
about what I like to do,

67
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,360
what I'm interested in.

68
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,720
And she goes,

69
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,360
"Well, I mean,

70
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,800
this is like cell culture stuff."

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
"I'm not sure

72
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,480
you'd be really interested in that."

73
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,240
So, she said,

74
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,400
"Well, let me introduce you

75
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,320
to this guy over here."

76
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,840
And this was already Friday, like 5:30.

77
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,920
So, I go in and just kind of the old days

78
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,400
where this guy's in his office

79
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,800
smoking cigars,

80
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,520
and turned out to be the chairman

81
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,800
of the Department of Medicinal Chemistry.

82
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,080
And he said,

83
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,560
"Okay. Tell me about yourself."

84
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,880
I go in the spiel and then, he says,

85
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,240
"Well, we didn't have any openings."

86
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,280
"But tell me more."

87
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,960
So, I keep on talking.

88
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,840
And then he just starts making

89
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,640
like he's ready to threw me out of office.

90
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,680
And then I go,

91
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,760
"Oh, by the way, what about the job?"

92
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,000
And he goes,

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,760
"Oh, yeah, you can start next month."

94
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,080
So, this is just one of those stories

95
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,320
where I just I was in the right place.

96
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,480
And you could say it's luck.

97
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,040
But I did my research

98
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,400
and I was at the right place.

99
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,120
And Friday afternoon

100
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,360
maybe wasn't the right time,

101
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,200
but maybe it was.

102
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,800
Because it showed that the people

103
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,360
that were still there,

104
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,160
were really passionate about their job.

105
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,320
And they would recognize

106
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,560
that same passion in me.

107
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,520
So, it's not really a coincidence.

108
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,200
It wasn't planned out.

109
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,240
But when I look back with hindsight.

110
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,600
So, fast forward,

111
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,280
I started working in the lab

112
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,520
first, like washing dishes.

113
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,120
And, of course, just like

114
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,000
one of these Zen books,

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,880
the first thing he did,

116
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,480
he showed me this incredibly messy lab

117
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:37,880
and he said,

118
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,080
"Okay, I want you to clean this up."

119
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,520
And of course, I was really excited.

120
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,760
And I cleaned it up really really great.

121
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,840
And he came back really impressed.

122
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,800
So, I ended up helping

123
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,920
this graduate student

124
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,000
that was struggling a little bit.

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,400
But basically he decided,

126
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,560
"Okay, let's give this guy a helper

127
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,320
and you can help wash dishes

128
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,400
or set up reactions

129
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,200
and just learn basically."

130
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,160
So, basically, I was very lucky

131
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,640
to start working at the lab

132
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,960
as an undergrad my first week there.

133
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,440
And then fast forward, three years later,

134
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,680
it's time to figure out

135
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,400
what I'm going to do.

136
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,080
I just did not really feel ready

137
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,040
to go out in the workforce.

138
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,160
I want to get my graduate degree.

139
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,320
So, I ended up applied

140
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,040
for the graduate program there.

141
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,440
Got accepted now.

142
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,840
Before I was helping a graduate student,

143
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,920
now, I was a graduate student there.

144
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,840
And I attend my PhD

145
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,920
in medicinal chemistry five years later.

146
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,960
Why medicinal chemistry?

147
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,980
So, what was fascinating to you

148
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,000
in medicinal chemistry?

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,160
Just looking at books

150
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,320
and how the original medicinal chemistry,

151
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,840
all the drugs came from plants,

152
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,440
morphine, belladonna, strychnine,

153
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,320
reserpine was the first anti-hypertensive.

154
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,800
It was isolated from plan.

155
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
It turned out actually,

156
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,920
it caused depression.

157
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,200
So, I was just fascinated

158
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,960
how things cause the different actions.

159
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,760
Of course, we've got some

160
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,520
of the amphetamines,

161
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,320
which are the original antidepressants.

162
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,880
They caused high blood pressure.

163
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,920
So, you have just very interesting.

164
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,160
it's just fascinating to me

165
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,680
just looking at the structures.

166
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,240
How the similar structures

167
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,560
had similar activities

168
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,440
or sometimes similar structures

169
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,680
have very different activities.

170
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,840
It was all fascinating.

171
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,720
So, I want to get into that.

172
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,960
And just be able to make, cure stuff.

173
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,640
So, talk to me about the transition

174
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,560
from medicinal chemistry

175
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,800
on the East Coast now to Silicon Valley.

176
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,560
Right. So, that was

177
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,440
another interesting thing.

178
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,680
So, actually, during my grad students

179
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,960
after I finished my masters,

180
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,600
I always want to go to California.

181
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,680
To Silicon Valley.

182
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,920
Even back when I was in New York.

183
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,040
I didn't even know what Silicon Valley was

184
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,160
I thought it was like this place.

185
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,600
I didn't realize it was really

186
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,520
a construct.

187
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,160
So, paint me the picture.

188
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,400
Because now it's very obvious why

189
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,600
a lot of people flock to the Bay Area.

190
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,080
Well, in 2020, a lot of people

191
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,000
flock out to the Bay Area.

192
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,160
But until now,

193
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,320
a lot of people flock in here.

194
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,120
And why back then,

195
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,240
when it's less of a big bubble

196
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,040
and it's a worldwide problem?

197
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,000
Because I think especially,

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,280
my dad was electronics engineer

199
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,280
and then I see Silicon Valley

200
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,760
got started in silicon.

201
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,640
In silicon. Right.

202
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah. So, I had a hankering

203
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,800
for getting out here.

204
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,680
So, a back of the story,

205
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,480
it was interesting.

206
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,800
And when I finished my Masters in 1986,

207
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,200
I said, "Maybe I can get out here now."

208
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,200
So, I applied to UCSF.

209
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,960
There's initial chemistry program there

210
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,080
for the PhD.

211
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,120
I got in. I came out here to visit

212
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,680
and I got off the plane at the tarmac.

213
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,600
At that point, the SFO

214
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,800
we actually we brought up a staircase.

215
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,440
Like the fresh air was just incredible.

216
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,680
I mean, basically, I flew out of Detroit

217
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,160
when I was in Ann Arbor.

218
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,600
And that was before admission.

219
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,760
So, California was the first

220
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,560
to have the car emission.

221
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,400
And so, it was like night and day.

222
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,200
I love this place.

223
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,960
They had some day of events

224
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,840
for the incoming potential students.

225
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,960
And I said,

226
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,040
"Oh, I really want to stay here."

227
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,280
But as a grad student,

228
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,440
I couldn't really enjoy it

229
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,720
because I didn't have much money.

230
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,960
And this in the lab.

231
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,520
And the guy back there

232
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
really helped me out

233
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,560
by giving me that job.

234
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,080
So, I'll stay.

235
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,840
So, anyway, I ended up staying

236
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,120
for another three years.

237
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,440
And then the interesting point is that,

238
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,000
what happened is that

239
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,560
when it was time to graduate,

240
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,080
I started looking around for postdocs.

241
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,840
And there was this guy,

242
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,640
I saw a postdoc position

243
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,320
at Caltech for Peter Dervan.

244
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,320
A very very high level guy in that field.

245
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,400
And I wrote up a proposal

246
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,840
for antisense DNA.

247
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,280
At that point,

248
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,520
I didn't even realize it was a thing

249
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,800
but I figured it would be cool.

250
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,080
Because I studied nucleoside.

251
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,680
So, if you string these along,

252
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,320
you could actually make like a code

253
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,400
and actually selectively block genes.

254
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,920
So, I wrote up a proposal to him.

255
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,520
I didn't get in there. Okay, whatever.

256
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,960
So, fast forward.

257
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,880
A couple of months, my boss comes back

258
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,240
from a meeting in California, says,

259
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,440
"Hey, I met this guy."

260
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,560
"You might be interested

261
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,400
in getting a job there."

262
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,920
"It's a company called Gilead Sciences."

263
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,040
"And they're doing antisense."

264
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,080
I go, "Oh wow. Great."

265
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,320
"This is what I wanted to do."

266
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,720
So, it's a 30 person startup

267
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,400
at this point in Foster City.

268
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,040
I go there and it's just great.

269
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,320
And I ace the interview.

270
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,880
I get the position.

271
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,520
And guess who's on the board of advisers?

272
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,880
Peter Dervan.

273
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,400
So, this is what I'm getting back to you.

274
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,440
You end up in the same place.

275
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,720
Because, well, you just do.

276
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,240
Because you just naturally fit there.

277
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,640
Right. Well, it sounds like,

278
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,920
on one hand, you're saying

279
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,000
you come back to the same place.

280
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,640
On the other hand,

281
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,000
a theme that I'm picking up here

282
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,240
throughout your experiences is that

283
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,000
you're very open to these opportunities.

284
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,400
You're taking that Friday afternoon meeting

285
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,000
and you're getting excited

286
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,040
about this idea of cleaning a lab

287
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,600
and doing to the best of your abilities.

288
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,720
You're excited about accepting a job offer

289
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,880
in Foster City with a 30 person startup.

290
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,960
So, things are aligning.

291
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,280
But it's not just by chance.

292
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,000
It sounds like,

293
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,080
because you're you're actively looking

294
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,960
for these opportunities

295
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,040
and harnessing them, right?

296
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,520
Yeah. So, I hate to say I actively looking

297
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,840
because sometimes like

298
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,400
I'm afraid, a little bit more passive.

299
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,480
But I always try to place myself

300
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,240
in places where these opportunities

301
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,480
are just there.

302
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,960
And then it come to me.

303
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,040
Because it's a little bit more natural

304
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,280
if you try to, you're pining for stuff.

305
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,560
I mean, some people can pull it off.

306
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,000
The J-Ventures people

307
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,960
are just a great bunch

308
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,720
and they're go getters and they can do it.

309
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,440
So, I compensate by just trying to be

310
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,200
in the right place at the right time.

311
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,720
Wonderful. Wonderful.

312
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,480
Yeah. So, there I am with Peter Dervan

313
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,860
and then working side by side

314
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,880
with a former postdoc office.

315
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,520
So, I would have ended up there anyway.

316
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,840
If I had gotten that postdoc,

317
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,560
I would have ended up at Gilead anyway.

318
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,680
So, just like that. It's pretty funny.

319
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,200
And then, of course,

320
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,440
if you go forward 25 years

321
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,160
that I spent there,

322
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,980
it ended up to be a fortune,

323
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,120
a hundred billion dollar company.

324
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,080
Wow.

325
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,280
And almost went bankrupt

326
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,360
a couple of times in its early days.

327
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,800
So, you're joining a 30 person startup

328
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,520
with somebody on the board

329
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,440
who you hope to do a postdoc with

330
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,760
and you end up doing similar work

331
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,880
within the company.

332
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,440
Fast forward 25 years

333
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,720
and that small startup in Foster City

334
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,360
that somebody told you about

335
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,560
is a hundred billion dollar company.

336
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,920
Right. And then, yeah.

337
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,720
So, the other funny thing is that,

338
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,800
so, during there I ended up transitioning

339
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,840
from medicinal chemistry at the bench,

340
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,240
leading a discovery group

341
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,360
and then getting drafted

342
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,680
into the patent office.

343
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,240
Into the patent department there.

344
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,080
Because as the pharma business

345
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,240
is all about really patents.

346
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,320
The patent side of thing.

347
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,080
And Gilead's idea there

348
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,200
was to mind the patent landscapes

349
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,280
of other people's patents.

350
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,880
To figure out what to do.

351
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,560
And then you have to design around, right?

352
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,320
Because you have some other company

353
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,800
has a great molecule,

354
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,120
but you want to make something better.

355
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,920
But they have a patent

356
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,840
on all this broad classes of molecules.

357
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,200
You have to, as a chemist to figure out,

358
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,160
okay, what's going to be active,

359
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,520
but not going to be dominated

360
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,480
by their patent.

361
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,440
Can we spend just two, three minutes

362
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,560
talking about why patents

363
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,760
in pharma and medicine,

364
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,000
why is it such an important thing?

365
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,720
Because for me,

366
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,800
and for a lot of other people

367
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,200
who are not coming in from this industry,

368
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,800
when we were building software

369
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,200
as a service, it's very hard to patent

370
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,160
as far as I understand.

371
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,520
But it sounds like in the field

372
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,000
that you were working in for many years,

373
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,440
it's mandatory.

374
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,160
So, talk to me a little bit

375
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,720
about this landscape of IP and patents

376
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
in medicine.

377
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,440
That's perfect.

378
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,120
So, we have a lot of clients

379
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,280
that do software as a service.

380
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,600
And I say, great.

381
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,800
Well, sometimes it's the combination

382
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,360
of a device that sends data

383
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,840
and then it gets process server side.

384
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,440
So, I tell them,

385
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,640
"Look, the device,

386
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,920
you have to file a patent on it."

387
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,040
"You have to disclose everything

388
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,880
that's in the device."

389
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,920
"Because if it's really valuable,

390
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,920
someone's going to open it up,

391
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
reverse engineer it."

392
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,560
I mean, there are out for stuff there

393
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,320
that take apart semiconductors.

394
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,200
They slice through silicon.

395
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,120
They do electron microscopy.

396
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,840
They think they can figure out

397
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,520
what you're wrong is

398
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,680
by looking at it

399
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
and figure out what the code

400
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,160
you can get code out.

401
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,520
So, everything that's

402
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,720
in the customer's hands

403
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,620
has to have a patent on it.

404
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,440
Server side, so yes, it's great,

405
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,200
because people can't really figure out

406
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,160
what you're doing.

407
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,560
So, you don't need to patent that.

408
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,880
And it's tough under our patent system

409
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,320
to patent software and stuff.

410
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,840
But it's good.

411
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,920
You just keep it server side

412
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,800
and you're fine.

413
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,960
With pharma, though, it's really the idea

414
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,840
that a certain molecule

415
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,760
can treat a particular disease

416
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
is its intellectual property, right?

417
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,160
Because once that information is out,

418
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,640
and information wants to be free,

419
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,120
anyone in India,

420
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,720
anywhere, Africa, Brazil,

421
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,960
can go in the lab make that molecule.

422
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,800
Right?

423
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,520
And it's not like you're the only one

424
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,640
that can make the molecule.

425
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,960
And you're the only one

426
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,560
who can be the single source.

427
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,720
Because with today's chemical technology,

428
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,360
if you give me a sample,

429
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,960
I can tell you what it is exactly

430
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,640
the structure of molecule usually,

431
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,200
within a couple hours

432
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,520
using this modern instrumentation we have.

433
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,400
And then, just given the chemical knowledge

434
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,440
accrued over the centuries,

435
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,320
we can go in the lab

436
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,720
and probably make that.

437
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,680
Within a month we can have

438
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,400
a pretty good synthesis of it.

439
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,760
So, I can go to pharmacy,

440
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,840
buy a pill, analyze it,

441
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,520
send it over to a contractor,

442
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,920
basically make duplicates very very quickly.

443
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,800
That's why you need a patent.

444
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,880
If someone has a weird

445
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,160
machine learning algorithm that's adaptive

446
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,600
and it's sitting in a server,

447
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,960
in their vault, whatever secure room,

448
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,480
it's kind of hard to figure out

449
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,200
how that works.

450
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,400
Although there are some theories

451
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,080
that you can.

452
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,280
But besides that, in pharma

453
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,240
it's about that molecule, right?

454
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,840
I mean, and the beauty of pharma is that,

455
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,200
people complain about the patent system,

456
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,440
but once the patents expire,

457
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,280
the system works like it's supposed to,

458
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,320
then anyone,

459
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,040
then that information is free.

460
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,800
Anyone can make that molecule.

461
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,640
There's regulatory issues.

462
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,040
So, that's why the value.

463
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,680
I mean, we're giving them this monopoly

464
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,360
for whatever, an average is about 12 years.

465
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,920
11 to 12 years.

466
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,840
It's supposed to be 20.

467
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,360
But it's on average, it ends up,

468
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,480
because of delays, ends up 11, 12 years.

469
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,280
And then later on,

470
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,680
the molecules are there for anyone.

471
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,680
So, I think that's what makes the system

472
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,120
really great.

473
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,080
And that's why patenting

474
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,280
is very important.

475
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,440
People say, pharma doesn't spend

476
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,680
that much money on research.

477
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,240
But to me, it's like, okay,

478
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,640
your brain doesn't use

479
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,240
all your body's energy, right?

480
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,720
But yeah, but if you don't have your body,

481
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,560
your brain can't work.

482
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,160
So, to me, it's like a pharma is,

483
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,560
80% of our budget is really

484
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,560
research and development.

485
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,920
Because you can't have research

486
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,960
and development if you don't have sales.

487
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,800
Doctors are pretty conservative.

488
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,160
Some people complain about

489
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,240
pharmaceutical advertising.

490
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,400
But on the flip side,

491
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,000
it takes a long time for,

492
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,800
I mean, look at the HIV drugs

493
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,080
Gilead developed.

494
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,560
It took a really long time for them

495
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,240
to really permeate the market.

496
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,400
And they're just like the best,

497
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,600
made incredible changes

498
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,840
in the lives of people,

499
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,680
people suffering with HIV.

500
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,360
Turning into a death sentence,

501
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,840
into a chronic disease.

502
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,960
And it's still took years

503
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,320
in order for the medical community

504
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,200
to really adapt to these things.

505
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,720
Just talking about PrEP,

506
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,960
which is the prophylaxis.

507
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,560
I mean, that would have been obvious

508
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,440
right at the start,

509
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,080
but we have to wait 20 years

510
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,440
before PrEP became a thing.

511
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,160
So, I think pharma does get a bad rap.

512
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,880
There are some bad pharma does

513
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,560
that do get to give them bad rap

514
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,320
or overall, I think,

515
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,640
you can't really say it's all that bad.

516
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,240
Right.

517
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,800
Every day [--]

518
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,640
eventually be free.

519
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,160
I'd love to spend the last few minutes

520
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,600
that we have talking a little bit

521
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,000
about your role as what you describe

522
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,880
as an emotional support angel.

523
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,840
I got a chance to talk

524
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,720
to quite a few angel investors,

525
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,680
especially here in the Silicon Valley.

526
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,200
And I've yet to hear the term

527
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,400
emotional support angel,

528
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,600
and I just love it.

529
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,880
So, talk to me a little bit

530
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,280
about what it means to you

531
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,120
to be an emotional support angel.

532
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,200
And you're investing in general

533
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,880
for both privately and in J-Ventures.

534
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,520
But let's start

535
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,280
with the emotional support side of it.

536
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,800
Right. So, I said

537
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,320
entrepreneurs have to think

538
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,400
they can walk through walls.

539
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,960
So, I'll give you an example.

540
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,960
So, the CEO was raising money.

541
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,520
She found a VC like,

542
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,640
a VC/angel type organization.

543
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,080
Basically told the GP what she needs.

544
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,160
And he wanted a reference.

545
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,560
So, she sent him my name

546
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,320
and I'm talking with him and he's asking,

547
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,000
"Oh, can she be a CEO?"

548
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,320
And I go,

549
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,840
"Yeah, she has this team already."

550
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,080
"She knows what she has to delegate

551
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,520
and what not."

552
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,280
"Just incredibly intense."

553
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,440
And he says,

554
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,720
"Okay, well, can I just confide in you."

555
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,840
"I mean, she told me

556
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,920
she can raise $10,000,000 this year."

557
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,480
"I mean, revenue."

558
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,240
"Do you think that's true?"

559
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,680
I just started laughing. I say,

560
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,280
"No. No way."

561
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,840
And he started laughing.

562
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,040
And he invested anyway. Right.

563
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,360
So, that's part of it.

564
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,800
And then, having telling the entrepreneur,

565
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,800
the CEO saying,

566
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:50,760
Well, look, it's good you were so intense,

567
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,160
you were really positive and optimistic

568
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,400
you could get that.

569
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,480
But at the same time,

570
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,720
you have to understand that not everyone,

571
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,600
it is an aspirational goal.

572
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,200
So, just telling maybe not everyone

573
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,320
would have that same response.

574
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,920
Some GPs will say,

575
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,080
"Oh, she can't? Okay. Forget it." Right?

576
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,880
But just following her. Yeah.

577
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,560
And then the other questions are,

578
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,600
they come back to me, says,

579
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,920
"Oh, was he really doubting my ability

580
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,040
as a CEO and stuff?"

581
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,880
And I go,

582
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,080
"Oh no, he's got to ask these questions."

583
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,080
So, just try to calm everything down.

584
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,600
And a lot of times these CEOs,

585
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,040
they just need to talk.

586
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,240
Right.

587
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,280
That's something that,

588
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,680
as a young entrepreneur,

589
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,560
you grow up

590
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,760
reading TechCrunch and Crunchbase.

591
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,600
Of our judgment,

592
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,040
because just when they're talking to you,

593
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,360
they're hearing themselves talk, right.

594
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,240
When you got that psychiatrists

595
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,760
and now the mental health people

596
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,280
and mental wellness people talk about

597
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,760
what's called a default mode network.

598
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,320
It's a voice in our head that keeps on

599
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,160
ruminating and going and thought loops

600
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,640
and doing stuff like that.

601
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,360
So, when you're an entrepreneur,

602
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,560
it's very easy to get into that, right?

603
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:07,880
You think,

604
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
"Oh, what do they think of me?"

605
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,960
Because you know

606
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,040
you're always on display.

607
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
You're always performing.

608
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,960
You're always questioning

609
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,840
how the audience is receiving you.

610
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,560
So, it's very easy to get into that

611
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,640
when you're talking to yourself.

612
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,520
It just sounds a lot different

613
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,280
than when you're saying the same thing

614
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,040
to someone else.

615
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,120
So, just being someone

616
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,360
that they can trust.

617
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,240
To just to basically listen

618
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,360
and not be judgmental

619
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,000
and keep thing in confidence.

620
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,880
I think that's important.

621
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,480
So, going back,

622
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,360
the reason I did tell that GP

623
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,600
that in my own opinion,

624
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,360
I didn't think she was going to be able

625
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,000
to get 10 million in 2020,

626
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,360
now, it still might happen,

627
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,840
so, I told him it might happen.

628
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:57,920
But I was confident in telling him

629
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,840
that I didn't think she could just because

630
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,040
I sensed that he didn't believe it.

631
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,120
So, I already knew.

632
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,800
I mean, if I thought

633
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,720
that he really thought she could

634
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,000
and just was kind of making sure,

635
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I probably would have demurred,

636
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,400
figured out some way to weasel out

637
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,680
of answering that question.

638
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,640
But [--]

639
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,920
It's a very interesting balance

640
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,320
that you're playing here.

641
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,400
On one hand, you have stake in the company

642
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,080
and you have a stake

643
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,440
in the success of the company.

644
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,840
And part of the success

645
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,360
is also the company's ability

646
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,520
and the founder's ability

647
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,480
to continue raising the funds.

648
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,160
And the other hand, you are somewhat also

649
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,120
of a psychiatrist and the best friend

650
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,720
and a mentor and an investor to the founder.

651
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,600
Right. Yes.

652
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,200
And emotional support angel.

653
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,640
Right. So, yeah.

654
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,560
So, I pretty much knew the guy knew,

655
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,600
he was convinced she couldn't.

656
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,200
But I think the reason he ended up

657
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,360
did putting in the money

658
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,280
is because she was so confident.

659
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,120
So, I think better way of saying

660
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,040
she was confident

661
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,240
that she had a shot at it.

662
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,560
And I think that's really,

663
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,840
if you're doing anything with startups,

664
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,280
it's all about the shot on goal.

665
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,360
Because, I mean, all things can happen.

666
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,560
You just you don't know.

667
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,160
So, it's about, is it a good shot on goal?

668
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,600
And I think a lot of VCs might,

669
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,560
they want to see free money.

670
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,200
They want to see money just sitting there

671
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,080
and pick it up always.

672
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,200
Oh, you want to subscribe a round?

673
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,560
Okay. Yeah, I want in. Right?

674
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,240
But so, I mean,

675
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,520
and so this other of J-Ventures,

676
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,920
this guy was pitching.

677
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
He claimed to have discovered

678
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,240
room temperature superconductivity.

679
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,360
And so, being an IP expert,

680
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,080
I took a look at his patents.

681
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,480
The application he had.

682
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,080
He was about to have an allowance

683
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,400
and it looked really good.

684
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,600
There was some technical issues

685
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,280
that even though, yes,

686
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,760
room temperature superconductivity,

687
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,600
it was still not clear

688
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,800
how you're going to commercialize it.

689
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,600
What's the best way to commercialize it.

690
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,200
And J-Ventures pass

691
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,200
just because they weren't,

692
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
they had to help the guy

693
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,320
with his PowerPoint,

694
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,960
but they just weren't sure

695
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,320
if it was going to be a big investor

696
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,440
coming in.

697
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,040
They can put in some money.

698
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,880
He had a family office coming in

699
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,640
and he was good.

700
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,900
He was open to getting operating guy

701
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,440
or even a CFO that could pitch.

702
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,800
So, that was all good.

703
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,560
That wasn't really a problem.

704
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,000
But they just,

705
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,800
always are going to be someone,

706
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,560
a big investor.

707
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,200
Well, I think you're touching upon

708
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,040
one thing that we didn't have time

709
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,800
to talk too much about.

710
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,160
But that's not a risk.

711
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,040
That the more you risk.

712
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,160
But I think that it is incredible that

713
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,000
as both as a private angel

714
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,840
and emotional support angel,

715
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,880
but also part of J-Ventures,

716
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,360
this ability to bring in a community

717
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,400
where all of a sudden

718
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,840
we have an opportunity

719
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,260
where we have Steve here who is an expert,

720
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,640
or is able to go and dig deep into this IP

721
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,600
and validate the technology.

722
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,120
I think that's something that really

723
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,640
when you have almost 200 people

724
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,680
that are involved with the fund,

725
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,000
that's something that incredible

726
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,520
that can happen.

727
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,480
But Steve, unfortunately,

728
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,080
we do have to end here.

729
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,040
But I do have to ask my favorite question,

730
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,800
which is three words that you would use

731
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,960
to describe yourself

732
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:16,960
Just the ever optimist, I think.

733
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,120
The ever optimist.

734
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,320
I love it. I love it.

735
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,840
Steve, thank you very much. Toda raba.

736
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,880
And I definitely look forward

737
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,680
to maintaining this relationship

738
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,960
and bringing some ideas to you as well.

739
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,040
All right. Thanks, Michael.

740
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,440
Thanks for the opportunity.

741
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:39,400
Okay.
