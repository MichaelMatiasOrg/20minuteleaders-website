1 All right. Neil Schloss, thank you so much for joining on 20 Minute Leaders. Good to be here. Thank you. So wonderful, so gracious of you to give me your time, Neil. You have one of the most impressive careers that I’ve come across -- 36 years at Ford. You’ve seen so much that I don’t know how we can try to summarize this in 20 minutes. But I’m going to try. And I'd love to spend this time learning from you what it means to be at an amazing company like Ford over these years, seeing these incredible technological transformations as you go through, seeing the great recession of 2008 as you’re taking part as an active CFO of the Ford Mobility subsidiary, but also helping the Ford company secure some huge liquidity to help go through this crisis. Neil, let’s start off with you. How did you even get to Ford? And how did you end spending 36 years there? Yeah, there’s a luck piece. There’s a faith piece that puts you in the right place at the right time. But born and raised in San Diego. I went to San Diego State. Was intending to be a chemistry major. And after I couldn’t get through Calculus with any meaningful grades, I decided it’s probably not the best place to be as far as the business. So, I took an econ course. I said this was pretty cool stuff. And so, I picked up the finance skillset in undergrad. And coming out of school in 1982, which was the end of the -- sort of the -- not depression, but clearly an economic recession that was going on, Ford was the only one hiring. And so, I got the one offer coming out of school. They were hiring in their aerospace division, which was in Palo Alto. Wow. And so, I actually started with Ford in Palo Alto. So, being born and raised in San Diego, moving north, spent five years or so in the bay area, then to Southern California before the aerospace. And then, we sold the business and had a chance to stay with Loral who was the acquirer or move to Detroit. And who knew what Detroit would be like. So, moving from 70 degrees and sunny every day to -- when I moved in January, - it’s to white snow on the ground. - Wow. It was a bit of a culture shock. And then spent 30 years here in Detroit with them, or 28 years with them. I’ve been here now 30 years in a variety of different finance roles. Joined the treasury organization about a year and a half into my tenure here. Fell in love with the markets. Fell in love with the ability to get sort of real-time performance reviews. So, every day, you are in the market trading. You were getting -- at the end of the day, you knew if you did a good job or not. Wow. And I think the external focus was also an important aspect that most big companies -- your jobs are focused internally. And the treasury roles tended to be with investors, with banks, with advisors. So, it’s much more an external focus to the lot of treasury, different roles. And then, got my dream job in March of ’07 when I became treasurer for the company. Had a team of about 300 folks globally. Wow! Of Ford? Hmm? - Of Ford, right? - Of Ford, yeah. Unbelievable. In the US center, and then three different international centers in China, in Brazil, then in Europe. Hold on. So, you’re -- the treasurer of the company in 2007, which is a fabulous time to become the treasurer of a huge, huge company that’s about to be hit like every other company, and I believe without bailout, you helped the company go through this crisis, raising $23 billion in liquidity. Talk to me about this. Paint me a picture. I was just a little kid. I was actually in the stock market class of December  of ’08 when my teacher -- he was my Math teacher as well, [Joe Liss]. He walks in, and says, “Kids, just so you know, you’re going to be telling about this class, about today, to your grandkids when you’re older because this is one of the most unique moments in history that you get to be in the stock market class during this crisis. I had the privilege of playing with Excel, with makeshift investments. You had to be the treasurer of Ford. Talk to me about this crisis. I think it goes back really when I was in the system treasure back in ’06. It was when we did the financing deck and the large home improvement loan that everybody talks about, the $23 billion. It was done in December 2006. Because it was actually before the financial crisis, before the auto crisis, we were having our own issues that were unique to the company as well as a starting of a slowdown in the industry. We raised $23 billion. And I remember several meetings that -- it’s, “How much can we get? How much can you take?” And one thing you’ll learn in a cyclical industry as a treasurer is you take money when people want to give it to you, not when you need it. - I’ve heard this so many times. - And that’s true today by the way as well. If I think about start-ups and think about the venture world in a crisis like this, the people who took money early are in much better position than those that didn’t. And you take money when people want to give it to you, and not when you need it. - So, we needed there -- - And when you need it, you never get it. So, along this line -- because it seems a little bit contradicting sometimes when you think of the lean startup bootstrapping. Don’t give away too much equity. Hold onto to what you can and try to power through, you're actually -- You and a lot of other really, really incredible people are saying, “No, no. No. This is a cyclical market. You’re going to have a rainy day. Make sure you have enough capital to power through whatever happens,” like COVID, like the great recession. Yeah. And I think you have to look at it from the standpoint of -- maybe we can get into this later. But I think you have look at it from the standpoint of who your customers and your clients are. It’s not your business that's necessarily -- that's -- you know, you're susceptible to your own risks. But if your clients are impacted by economic recession, in which case, your business -- your revenue goes away, it’s more than just your own business, because it's to your customer risks. But anyway, back to ’07. The auto industry started to have problems in ’07. The banking industry started with Bear Stearns in March of ’08. AIG and Lehman in September of ’08. The auto task force was set up, the congressional hearings. And we didn’t know where things were going to end. So, we went through a huge amount of work in a period of ’06 to ’09, basically buttoned down as much as we could to raise as much funding as we could. We did equity swaps. We took that out at pennies on a dollar, which I hope to never do again. We drew on our credit revolver. - Wow. - And when it came down to -- I guess May of ’09 when Chrysler went under, and then, soon thereafter GM, the key for us was making sure we kept the liquidity we needed, but also that the supply base had its liquidity because if the supply base were to go, you couldn’t sustain yourself. And so, I think it was better to be lucky than good. In some cases, we raised enough money early enough. We were creative on how we did things. We had a management team that was focused on product line and prioritizing what vehicles we needed to produce by when. And I think the leadership team all -- We met every single day -- - Wow. - Held hands and -- ―not literally, but figuratively― held hands and fought through it and did what we could do to keep us from having to go under. So, I mean how do you go about thousands of employees are unsure of what’s happening? You’re saying you meet every day as a leadership team, which means that every day there’s new insights, there’s new decisions and new adaptations. How do you actually -- and you’re in charge of a division of 300 people. Yup. How do you even communicate this crisis and optimism, realistic pessimism? Yeah. Today, actually, would be a lot easier because you can just set up a Zoom and you can talk to 300 people. Get everybody on and you can give everybody sort of daily updates or you could do five-minute videos to send out. I think the technology today would have made it easier. Unfortunately, we also see companies who are it’s too easy. And you know, - we've seen - Yeah. some pretty nasty lay-offs recently, yeah. When you go through crisis, it’s better to over-communicate than under-communicate. Yes. I think the other piece -- and I think this is something I probably didn’t know enough early on. But I think that the ability to show calm, show confidence -- you obviously have to empathize with those folks that are going to lose their jobs. You have to show positive emotion, that you know what you’re doing, you’re confident in what you’re doing because you need -- you’re not doing the work. So, as a leader you’re not physically doing the work. And so, you need your team to be energized, to believe in the cause and to know that their leaders are taking care of them and providing the oversight and guidance and strategic direction. But they have to physically feel that they want to do the work and they want to be successful because the heart and minds will follow  if you have good leaders. And I think we had a great leadership team headed by Arnold Riley and the support of the board for what we were trying to do, which was to survive. - As a leader, did you --? - We didn't know what tomorrow -- You know, we took every -- I mean I just remember some of the conversations I had at home when I came home -- you come home late, you get in early, and just talking to my wife not knowing exactly what tomorrow was going to bring, and whether or not we would survive. That’s just fascinating. And Neil, did you ever have as a leader, some moments where you had to portray optimism even though deep inside, you’re like, “Oh, wow! I’m not actually sure -- I’m not actually sure about this”? I’m not a sugar coater. So, from the standpoint of giving somebody a bunch of BS just to keep them happy is not my character. It’s not my leadership style. I’m transparent and that’s going to be -- I’m very transparent in how I feel, in how I act. And I think from my perspective, you can do it with the reason you’re doing stuff, the mode, in which you’re doing stuff, the emotion. You have to stay balanced because you lose it if you’re over -- if you’re cheerleader every day of the week and you’re cheerleading, your team won’t believe it. Right. If you blow up all the time and -- you know, they won’t believe it. And so, you have to show balance in what you’re doing. And I -- when I got angry and when I would explode, they took me seriously because it did not happen very often. And it was -- even though you try not to, you try to avoid making it personal, that’s hard. But I do think you have to be balanced. You have to be transparent in everything you do because shadow of a leader is a real concept. People will follow and behave the way you behave. - Definitely. - If you're a jerk they’ll be a jerk because you got ahead. So, by definition, it pays to be a jerk, right? And so, from that perspective you got to really be aware that people are watching everything you do -- Right. -- all the time, what you say, how you do it. Non-verbal is just as important as verbal, maybe more so because people tend to believe your non-verbal more than they believe your verbal. Right. But those, I think -- that sort of -- you got to get through it, but they got to believe you. - I'm looking back... - Then, they’re going to follow. I’m looking back at my time as a team leader in the army, And I’m thinking -- one of the big lessons that I’ve learned was that I wanted to be the best all the time. And so, I would -- I always communicated that whatever we’re doing always critically important and it’s important that we meet every milestone. And looking back, I can see exactly what you’re saying that at some point, these words of this is critical, this is important, they’re starting to lose value because not everything can be important. And I think that -- And now I’ve realized that as a leader, it was my responsibility also to know how to delegate the importance of the different tasks so that when there is something that’s really urgent, they’ll take it seriously because all of a sudden, a year into it, there was something that was really urgent and I said, and they’re like, “Yeah, but last week was urgent, too, and two weeks ago was also urgent." So, as a leader, you have to balance. I love that. But, Neil, one of  -- You also have to find that time where you can go away from everybody. Mm-hmm. and explode. [laughter] Right? Or express feelings and emotions -- and my wife took a burden of a couple of them. And when you come home, the little teeny things that you’ve been built up and built up and built up, you explode. But for me, it was biking. For me, it was Shabbat, I mean shutting down for 25 hours was critical to being able to to stay focused. Yeah, I know. I think I read somewhere that you mentioned that your co-workers, when it hit three 3PM on a Friday, they would look at the clock, and say, “Neil, I think it’s time for Shabbat. Please go home,” - which is a little bit -- - I had a boss -- I had a boss that did that once in a meeting, and said, “Don’t you need to leave?” It was great. Incredible. Incredible. Now I think I -- you know, just unders -- like empathizing with your co-workers and understanding the different circumstances. That’s wonderful. And I’m imagining there weren’t too many observant Jews in Ford, especially, in executive positions back then. So, I think that’s really remarkable. Nope, there wasn’t but they were over the top on supporting what I was doing. Amazing. Neil, you mentioned also that you’re not a big car guy. Or you didn’t grow up a huge car guy, yet you spent 36 years in Ford, in a car company, obviously. So, are you a car guy now or are you still more of a -- economics guy that helped lead a huge company? It’s funny because I wasn’t a car guy and I never claimed to be because -- I like to drive cars but do I care how they operate; do I care how they work? I really don’t, right? And that was an odd ball at Ford because you had people who collected cars, who -- I had a boss at one point who had an old Ford pick-up truck, like in the 1930-some odd pick-up truck. And he and his brother would build it, and then take it apart, and then build it, and take it apart. And it was just like I could never understand. That to me was just like, “Why?” But it’s funny now because what I’m doing now post-Ford is all about automotive 2.0. It’s all about how transportation is evolving, how mobility is evolving. And so, I really -- I’m not a car guy, but I am now becoming a transportation, an efficient transportation person who really -- I can dig. I can really dig into now the technology, how things are working. Help people move from spot A to point B -- - Right. - And... -- on that. And so, where I wasn’t a technical car guy before, I’m becoming much more of a transportation auto person today. - Where is this going? - And I’m spending most of my time doing that. Where is transportation going? What are like the big things that you’re passionate about and you’re saying like, “Wow. This is crazy. Well, I think it was all headed toward sort of micro-mobility, shared mobility, unique use cases, and how people travel from point A to point B, whether it's everything from using your legs to spaceships. Right? That mode of transportation is now just not when -- you know, I grew up and I spent 36 years working on manufacturing, assembly or designing, manufacturing, selling, financing cars, was the transportation business model. That was automotive 1.0. And you lost touch with the customer post either the dealer relationship and/or the warranty -- Right. -- and you didn’t really get the customer until they needed a transportation. So, it was very narrow. That whole thing has been expanded to what services can I provide? How do I add different modes of transportation, the whole public service transportation is a broken model. Cities are a broken model. There are so many things from an efficiency perspective that we can create that the startup world is just like hitting home runs on -- from the standpoint of improving the way this was all going. And there are so many different technologies that are being developed that -- you know, some will work, and some won’t. And some won’t work because they have a great technology, but they haven’t figured out the business model for which that technology could be utilized. So, where is it going? Who the heck knows? - Who knows? - It’s going. It’s going. And I think we have to take it step by step. Obviously, there's electronic vehicles, new battery. There's autonomous vehicles will come at some point. Right now, there’s a lot of technology to make that happen in an efficient way, but there’s a lot of work to be done yet on all the used cases from the standpoint of who’s making those decisions on what you hit priority-wise. You know, if you can -- if you hit an old lady, or be hitting a fire hydrant, right? Those are decisions that people have to make. It’s not a computer that’s going to make those decisions. - And those are tough decisions. - [unclear] what’s fascinating, I took an ethics and AI class at Stanford and one of the fascinating things that came up was that, “Yes, the humans need to decide whether you hit the fire hydrant or the person. But at the end also, there’s the famous trolley problem of do you push a button to switch the train tracks to hit an older person, rather than the baby on the tracks. And it turns out that also different countries have different skills of what they’re willing to do. I believe MIT did a huge study on this and I think it’s a fascinating world we’re going to. And  you mentioned start-ups. So, now you’re also very involved with J-Ventures as an LP and -- Yup. helping start-ups. So, how do you transition now from 36 years at Ford to helping start-ups and looking towards this future? I think it's pretty crazy. Yeah. I mean the transition for me happened in my last two years at Ford when I was really helping. I left the treasury role, was the CFO of Ford Mobility and Ford Mobility, when I came on board, had five employees and we were just getting started. So, it was like a start-up inside of Ford -- Yeah. -- which has its own issues. And so, I was employee number 5, I think, or thereabouts. And we then would often -- we bought four different companies. We started our own - Wow. - businesses. And so, we were a start-up inside and sort of operating that way. And so, transitioning from the treasury role in the financing business into the mobility business became sort of a nice transition point to retirement from Ford, and starting to work heavily into the start-up world, focusing obviously on the automotive business on mobility. And got lucky and got connected to a couple of start-ups where I joined their boards. I’m doing something with a bank to capitalize on my treasury skills as well. And then, J-Ventures, I got introduced to Oded sort of the end of last, last year through an existing LP. And that’s been six, seven months now.  It’s been great. I’ve met a lot of folks. The networking, the quality of the team, both in J-Ventures but also the LPs are just phenomenal. A hundred percent. And the ability to learn from people in this business and to make new friends, and to make new acquaintances, and open more doors, it’s been great. I love it. I love it. Neil, I can’t believe 20 minutes are almost up. But I have to ask the most important question -- three words that best describe you. Well, I’ve used transparent already once or twice in this discussion. So, I’ll probably use that one again from a standpoint of -- I'm a transp -- you know, it’s all -- for me, it’s all about leadership. And so, it’s about being transparent. It’s about being honest. And I would say, mentor would be the third one. And again, it gets to -- my leadership philosophy is helping others get to where they need to go, which is mentorship piece of it. Being transparent, so there’s no doubt about where you are. There’s no question about what your objectives are. And then, honesty is sort of a -- you can’t do any of that stuff if you’re not honest. Transparent, honest and mentor. I love it. Neil, thank you so much. Toda raba. This was wonderful. I learned so, so much. And I’ll see you around J-Ventures. Hopefully, in person. I would definitely love so. Thank you. All right. Take care, man.
