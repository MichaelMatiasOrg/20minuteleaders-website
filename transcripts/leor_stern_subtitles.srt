1
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,720
All right.

2
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,680
Leor Stern, thank you

3
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,760
for being on 20 Minute Leaders.

4
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,840
How are you?

5
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,440
Good. Good.

6
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,480
It's my pleasure.

7
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,880
I am so excited to speak to you

8
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,160
about your journey.

9
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,600
Your LinkedIn says, Two-time Googler.

10
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,640
Not many people have that.

11
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,720
A lot of people have ex-Googler

12
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,200
or Googler.

13
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,080
But two-time Googler,

14
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,520
that's, I think, something special

15
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,360
that I want to hear about.

16
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,720
I want to hear about your experience

17
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,240
with the watch industry

18
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
and the smartwear.

19
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,920
How are we advancing

20
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,800
with different devices

21
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,240
that are in our lives,

22
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,480
but with technology.

23
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,080
And, your journey

24
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,800
from corporate to startup,

25
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,520
to another startup to corporate.

26
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,720
Lior, take me through a journey.

27
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,000
How do you get started with what you do?

28
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,440
Yeah, I mean, Google,

29
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,600
when I first joined Google in 2003,

30
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,280
it wasn't quite that corporate yet.

31
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,520
There were a couple thousand people

32
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,840
in the company and it was still felt.

33
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,920
And I think, in retrospect,

34
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,960
obviously was, early days.

35
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,480
Wow. 2003, that's wow.

36
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,400
Yeah. Yeah.

37
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,560
You know, in the story I tell,

38
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,320
since we're Israeli is the,

39
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,160
I was the first Israeli at Google

40
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,560
who was not either

41
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,440
a software engineer,

42
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,800
or like work in HR.

43
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,920
And so, the ads business in Israel

44
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,440
was my 20% project which completely grew.

45
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,640
And then I basically,

46
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,440
just to give you a sense

47
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,960
of how we did things back then,

48
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,240
I recruited my friends

49
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,080
who were in university

50
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,560
to help translate text strings

51
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,640
as we were localizing the AdWords product

52
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,040
into the Hebrew and local currency.

53
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,960
And then, as the business kept growing,

54
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,560
I wasn't fucking it up.

55
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,280
And it's always a good thing.

56
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,800
Yes. Yes.

57
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,800
And so, and I lobbied for a while

58
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,840
that Google should get more serious

59
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,360
about Israel and open an office.

60
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,680
And so, when we finally decided

61
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,560
to do that,

62
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,600
I was first person on the ground

63
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,680
to hire and train the team

64
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
and help them get set up

65
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,920
and integrate with Google broadly.

66
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,360
And then, from there, I did a similar role

67
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,480
building and managing a larger cluster

68
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,560
of the team.

69
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,840
What are some of the challenges

70
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,640
that go with bringing a business

71
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,160
like Google AdWords to another country?

72
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,520
Both, obviously, the localization of it,

73
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,240
but also in terms of mindset.

74
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,480
Looking at a whole different country,

75
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,520
a whole different operations.

76
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,280
What entails with that endeavor?

77
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,920
I think, it's almost like

78
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,920
moving countries, right?

79
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,800
So, it's a big logistical challenge

80
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,520
that contains within it

81
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,840
lots and lots of smaller problems, right?

82
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,080
So, what you do is,

83
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,800
you try to break down,

84
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,280
here's all the problems

85
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,240
and almost turn it into

86
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,040
like a step by step, kind of okay.

87
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,480
So, first you need to establish

88
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,720
a local tax entity, local legal entity,

89
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,600
so that you can operate in this market.

90
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:18,920
Right.

91
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,480
Then if you're getting paid again,

92
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,240
this is before Stripe.

93
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,880
And with every accepting foreign currency,

94
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,600
you ought to have largely

95
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,640
homegrown solutions for that.

96
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,400
So, you have to figure out

97
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,520
how to get paid,

98
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,040
how to establish your taxation status.

99
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,040
It's just basically a list of problems

100
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,440
that you cross off, right?

101
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,960
Who going to run this entity

102
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,920
What kind of rules do we need.

103
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,800
What is our business objective look like.

104
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,880
In the end, we had something like

105
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,240
150 page presentation,

106
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,640
that was the road map,

107
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,880
like the business plan

108
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,320
for Google in this country.

109
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,560
Unbelievable. Okay.

110
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,000
But then Lior, there's so much

111
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,640
that I want to cover.

112
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,560
So, you move on to

113
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,500
head of the business development at IFTTT.

114
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,040
Now, I have used IFTTT myself

115
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,880
to help me automate some processes.

116
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,480
And for whoever doesn't know,

117
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,640
IFTTT, If This Then That,

118
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,160
it's this idea that we can create

119
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,600
our own paths to productivity

120
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,000
and automate different processes,

121
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,600
integrating different applications, right?

122
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,320
Yeah, I know. That's exactly right.

123
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,120
And so, then, what does that mean

124
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,720
leading the business development?

125
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,080
After 10 years at Google,

126
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,000
you decide to go.

127
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,040
And between what you just told me,

128
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,240
and when you left for IFTTT,

129
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,000
you've done so much, obviously.

130
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,440
And you run business development also,

131
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
within Google for different jurisdictions.

132
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,640
So, but then you transitioned

133
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,520
to the startup life.

134
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,240
And what was that transition like?

135
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,000
So, I left Google after 10 years,

136
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,560
and joined IFTTT.

137
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,360
And when I joined IFTTT,

138
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,240
there were nine people on staff.

139
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,240
So, it was still very small.

140
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,800
It was, the product was well established

141
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,760
and still doing well.

142
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,800
And I love it.

143
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,320
But at the time,

144
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,880
the company was still small.

145
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,480
And, there were things,

146
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,000
by the time I left Google,

147
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,240
it was much bigger,

148
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,840
I would say that it does meet

149
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,920
your definition of corporate here, right?

150
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,640
So, I was definitely leaving

151
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,200
the big company life behind.

152
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,560
It was a little bit

153
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,560
like jumping off the ledge, right?

154
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,640
Especially having spent,

155
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,200
professionally,

156
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,560
I grew up at Google, right?

157
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,320
And, what I will say is,

158
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,360
overall the experience was there were,

159
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,480
I didn't find that I was that much

160
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,760
of a disadvantage or that I even missed

161
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,960
some of the big company

162
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,920
creature comforts and perks,

163
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,680
as much as I feared I might.

164
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,200
At the end of the day,

165
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,000
what you have in the snack room

166
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,680
or where you get your lunch is,

167
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,880
those things can have a cumulative effect

168
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,440
to optimize your working day.

169
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,040
But it's not like not having these things

170
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,200
is catastrophic.

171
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,720
And I also found that,

172
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,760
professionally and creatively

173
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,480
extremely liberating to come

174
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,160
into a much smaller environment.

175
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,360
And basically have to tackle problems

176
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,160
end to end,

177
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,920
and spend time thinking about

178
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,680
how do we impact things for our users,

179
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,800
how do we impact things for the ecosystem.

180
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,120
Rather than, how do I navigate

181
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,040
the internal checks and balances

182
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,600
and all the kinds of points of friction

183
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,400
that a big company has

184
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,320
on the way to getting something done.

185
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,280
Right. And then,

186
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,760
running business development

187
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,760
for small, fast growing product,

188
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,680
very focused, rather than dealing

189
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,000
within the business organization

190
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,720
of Google,

191
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,800
How does that fare?

192
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,000
What are the different priorities

193
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,080
that you have to keep in mind?

194
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,440
So, I think, you need

195
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,400
to dial up the hustle factor quite a bit,

196
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,560
because at a startup, it really is

197
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,480
much more existentially critical

198
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,600
that you get things done.

199
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,920
I think, it's also hard, even for,

200
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,600
if you have a hot brand,

201
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,000
it can still be difficult

202
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,680
to get mind share,

203
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,560
and what's most from big companies

204
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,360
that you're trying to partner with.

205
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,440
And what's most difficult,

206
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,720
is getting prospective partners

207
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,960
or customers to trust you, right?

208
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,040
To trust that the company will,

209
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,480
that there's longevity,

210
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,840
and that you're a good investment

211
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,320
of their money or time.

212
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,360
So, those are some

213
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,600
of the bigger challenges.

214
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,440
I think on the plus side,

215
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,840
startups can take bigger risks.

216
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,760
There's less baggage.

217
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,080
There's less legacy stuff to deal with.

218
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,520
So, even as something as simple as,

219
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,960
look, I'm making a call out to Nike

220
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,160
to suss them out about something,

221
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,160
you just need to find a contact

222
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,560
and set up time with them.

223
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,720
You don't need to worry about like,

224
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,200
well, are there other conversations

225
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,680
going on with Nike,

226
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,160
like this team working with them, right?

227
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,720
Which by the time I left Google,

228
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,480
was the case,right?

229
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,720
Like the're lots and lots and lots,

230
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,040
the breadth of activity was so vast.

231
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,040
So, you need to hustle more,

232
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,920
but there's less dissipation of effort,

233
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,880
if that makes sense.

234
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
And I think that's true.

235
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,960
I found that to be the case

236
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,200
as a startup CEO as well.

237
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:32,000
You don't have the advantages

238
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,560
of a big platform to go with,

239
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,960
but you also,

240
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,640
once you focus on doing something,

241
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,200
99% of your effort is just doing it,

242
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,520
instead of doing it

243
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,200
and doing your diligence,

244
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,760
or satisfying checks and balances,

245
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,280
and the things that, again,

246
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,640
a larger public company

247
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,520
has the responsibility to go through.

248
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,280
So, you move from corporate, to joining

249
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,840
the leadership of an existing company.

250
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,520
And then, you decide to go full throttle

251
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,800
on the entrepreneurship path

252
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,960
and create a startup yourself.

253
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
You end up selling that startup to Google,

254
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,560
which is actually

255
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,720
how you go back to Google.

256
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,240
And that is the two-timer.

257
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,840
But walk me through.

258
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,560
You become passionate about something

259
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,880
that I don't believe

260
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,200
you've dealt with before, right?

261
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
This whole like smart wear

262
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,240
and how we're interacting

263
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,320
with technology on our bodies.

264
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah. Yeah.

265
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,160
So, in my first run, I guess, at Google,

266
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,720
I worked on a lot of emerging

267
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,200
hardware form factors

268
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,360
and I was involved with

269
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,400
some mobile technologies early on.

270
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,680
I did a lot of work on speech recognition.

271
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,440
For instance, in location,

272
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,280
And so, when I started Chronologics,

273
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,680
it really was, we started the company

274
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,240
in late 2014.

275
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,000
I'd been thinking about it for a while,

276
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,800
but I also saw that Apple launched

277
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,200
the Apple Watch then.

278
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,720
And I became convinced that this is where

279
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,520
the puck was headed, right?

280
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,960
That wearables were going to be

281
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,840
a significant personal computing

282
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,080
form factor.

283
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,000
And, this was a problem

284
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,080
that I wanted to take part in solving.

285
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,280
So, that's how we came to work

286
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:19,760
on the space.

287
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,640
I also think, since you know IFTTT,

288
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,760
and by virtue of being a connector

289
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,720
between different products

290
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,320
and services, early on

291
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,800
I also got to spend a lot of time

292
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,120
with wearable companies

293
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,800
and creating these integrations

294
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,280
that allowed people to face

295
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,680
this flash my light disco theme

296
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,360
if I meet my Fitbit step count, right?

297
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,200
Those kinds of things.

298
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,080
So, I saw that there was a lot of interest

299
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,840
and a lot of value for users.

300
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,360
Not necessarily in that silly example,

301
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,560
but in the smart wearables.

302
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,320
100%.

303
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,240
And then, but you go then

304
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,000
to the more softer side.

305
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,600
You actually build

306
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,840
an operating system, right?

307
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,720
For wearables.

308
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,320
And so, you're coming in

309
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,040
from this business background.

310
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,800
The head of business development.

311
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,240
And you go down and you said,

312
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,320
"Okay, well, I'm going to actually go

313
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,200
and do heavy software eventually,

314
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,960
to be integrated onto these wearables."

315
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,320
Is that the traditional path for somebody

316
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,480
coming from business development

317
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:23,080
to then create a software based startup?

318
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,200
So, it's been done.

319
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,440
I'm much more familiar with people

320
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,320
starting out. For instance,

321
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,640
getting computer science degrees,

322
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,200
or starting out in the technical roles

323
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,240
and joining the dark side

324
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,200
of going into business roles.

325
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:43,080
I think that I'm a little averse to labels

326
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,640
and labeling people in their careers.

327
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,600
And I see that a lot

328
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,240
even as I interview people

329
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,240
or as a hiring manager at different times.

330
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,800
We have a tendency of thinking of someone

331
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,080
based on the job.

332
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,600
The last job that they've done,

333
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,520
or the role they've done the most of.

334
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,120
And I think we run the risk

335
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,160
of shortchanging ourselves by saying,

336
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,080
"Oh, I'm a business guy."

337
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,360
I can't speak out a product

338
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,400
or build a prototype of UI

339
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,080
for a smartwatch, for instance.

340
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,920
And my point is,

341
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,320
you never know until you try, right?.

342
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,920
But look, I'm not going to BS you,

343
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,000
I think, there's limited efficiency, right?

344
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,040
There's diminishing returns.

345
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,480
There's a strong argument to be made

346
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,480
for doubling down in one role.

347
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,560
Of course.

348
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,280
And I certainly have

349
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,400
proportionately overdeveloped

350
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,120
business negotiation strategy muscles

351
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,320
relative to some of the other things

352
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,960
that I needed to use as a software [--]

353
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,280
That's really awesome.

354
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,200
Now, I want you to talk to me

355
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,800
about this thing.

356
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,440
So, right now, we have so many people

357
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,560
walking around with these things

358
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,160
on their wrists.

359
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,040
You've been in this space

360
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,080
for now six years.

361
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,720
And you've been thinking about this daily.

362
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,240
And it's one of the questions

363
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
that always came up

364
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,280
between me and my friends

365
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,320
as we're seeing this world unfold

366
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,640
and as we're getting introduced

367
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,760
to this new phenomenon

368
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,560
of our phone on our hand,

369
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,760
where is the world going?

370
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,120
I mean, how do you see

371
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,760
smartwear technology

372
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,320
integrated into society?

373
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,600
And I want to play like a mind game

374
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,880
of where you're going to see this going

375
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,800
the next 10 years?

376
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,680
And what things we can be excited about

377
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,480
or pessimistic about?

378
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,440
Yeah. I mean, for me,

379
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,800
it's really a source of excitement.

380
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,520
Look, I think,

381
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,600
I'm a big believer in the notion that

382
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,480
computing is becoming ubiquitous, right?

383
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,840
So, everything around us

384
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,960
is becoming connected.

385
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,840
Doesn't necessarily mean

386
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,280
everything's going to have a screen

387
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,760
or a microphone or,

388
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,680
but things are going to have

389
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,240
sensing capabilities, inputs and outputs.

390
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,920
And ultimately, the world around you

391
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,600
is going to be a set of devices

392
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,680
that talk to each other.

393
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,640
And there will hopefully be, and I think,

394
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,800
you certainly see Google as being

395
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,840
one of the services that can help bring

396
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,840
all of these disparate endpoints together

397
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,280
to unlock value for the user, right?

398
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,000
To solve problems of users.

399
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,840
So, I think that's true in general.

400
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,120
And so, we're moving from a world

401
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,960
in which you used to sit at a computer,

402
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,920
and then you took your laptop with you,

403
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,200
and now, you've got a computer with you

404
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,360
all the time in your pocket.

405
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,640
Moving to this modality where the computer

406
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,040
is just ambiently around you, right?

407
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,920
And so, when it comes to wearables,

408
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,080
for me, I mean, the wristwatch dates back

409
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,280
to the 1600s, right?

410
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,560
It's in many ways the original

411
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,680
personal computing form factor.

412
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,000
And so, it's tried and true.

413
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,120
And there's a lot of value

414
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,280
in having something on your wrist.

415
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,480
Both as like a quick

416
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,840
glanceable device for interactions,

417
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,680
for consuming information.

418
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,560
And increasingly, and I think,

419
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,760
we're seeing this industry wide

420
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,880
with smartwatches

421
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,880
as a place to fit sensors

422
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,400
that can help you understand

423
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,680
what's going on in your body

424
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,320
and potentially even save your life.

425
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,480
So, I think, and I'm not saying

426
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,680
that the watch is going to eat the phone.

427
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,080
I don't think that's happening.

428
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,480
But in a broad constellation

429
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,400
of computing devices that you work with,

430
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,280
the wristwatch has these

431
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,840
three critical advantages to me.

432
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,640
One is, it works

433
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,720
and we're comfortable with it.

434
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,760
Two, a good place for sensors.

435
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,320
Three, good form factor

436
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,240
for certain interactions

437
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,200
and consuming information.

438
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,320
What's missing?

439
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,320
So, what's missing from my interaction

440
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,440
with my watch right now that you think,

441
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,280
I will have in the coming years?

442
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,320
So, I think what's missing,

443
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,000
there's still friction, right?

444
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,040
We haven't eliminated.

445
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,520
So, I think,

446
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,720
specifically things like battery life,

447
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,600
battery life is still quite limited.

448
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,960
It's another thing to charge.

449
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,560
Like there's some clunkiness to that.

450
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,720
We're still largely, I mean, I think

451
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,960
there are cellular connected options

452
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,120
for wearables, but I think,

453
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,960
that's still a little bit the exception.

454
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,680
It's expensive. It's again,

455
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,440
there are power implications there.

456
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,440
By the way, that prevention

457
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,630
that you mentioned before,

458
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,200
I'm looking at the general consumer,

459
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,600
when they purchase a watch,

460
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,240
do they use it as frequently

461
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,960
as they would have a regular watch?

462
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,560
Or does it get to a point where,

463
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,320
they put it away, they forget about it,

464
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,120
they stop using it, they come back to it.

465
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,080
What's the relationship

466
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,320
of today's consumers with wearables?

467
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,880
Yeah. I mean, look, I think attrition,

468
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,360
as with any product, is key,

469
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,040
and definitely the battery life.

470
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,320
There's a lot of data that shows that

471
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,880
once you have to take something off

472
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,600
every so often to charge it,

473
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,680
that can significantly increase

474
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,960
the chances that you're going to forget

475
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,800
to put it back on,

476
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,120
which intuitively makes sense.

477
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,080
So, that's definitely

478
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,840
a challenge that exists.

479
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,280
But in general, obviously,

480
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,480
many people are very very happy

481
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,960
with their smartwatches

482
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,920
and use them on an ongoing basis.

483
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,520
And there's also a link of

484
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,640
the fitness and wellness aspect

485
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,440
of these devices.

486
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,400
Because it's, again,

487
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,040
you can't get that from your phone, right.

488
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,000
Or certainly, not all of it

489
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,840
and not as easily.

490
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,880
And so, I think that that plays into it.

491
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,760
I think, there are other challenges

492
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,680
with the smartwatches.

493
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,800
I think, things new technologies,

494
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,960
we all had this sugar high

495
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,560
from the smartphone revolution,

496
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,640
which is a very rapid

497
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,880
onset transformation, right?

498
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,960
And then, we look at things like AI,

499
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,760
we look at things

500
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:48,000
like augmented reality, drones.

501
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,600
Like these are

502
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,480
technological development cycles

503
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,600
that are taking a little bit longer

504
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,120
to bear fruit.

505
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:56,600
It doesn't mean

506
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,720
they're not going to be monumental.

507
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,400
It just means that we need to be patient.

508
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,320
And I think, the same is true

509
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,400
with wearables

510
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,720
and with the smartwatch in particular.

511
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,200
I think we're still in this modality

512
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,960
of like developing these devices,

513
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,440
like a mini phone.

514
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,200
And as we move away from that,

515
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,360
we're going to see greater adoption

516
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,000
and ultimately, more value.

517
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,680
Very very cool. I have to ask,

518
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,120
you left Google for a few years.

519
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,760
And I'm extrapolating to any company

520
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,280
that grows naturally with time.

521
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,840
You come back a few years later.

522
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,360
You come back to the same company.

523
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,800
But it has to be a different company

524
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,760
in some sense.

525
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,800
Were you surprised by any social norms

526
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,880
or different things,

527
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,040
that all of a sudden, you're like,

528
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,000
wow, I did not expect to see this

529
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,400
when I came back?

530
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,120
Yeah. I mean, things again,

531
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,400
it's hard to grok

532
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,560
the different timelines, right?

533
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,760
So, like an organization evolves

534
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,000
at a different pace

535
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,960
than you experience your own career.

536
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,320
It was mostly the same,

537
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,160
I think that there were,

538
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,680
some positive surprises.

539
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,800
I think, in general,

540
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:03,520
the debate style and the team dynamics

541
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,320
have shifted and have been shifting

542
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,000
towards being nothing that was ever like

543
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,320
a huge problem in my first run.

544
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,200
But more inclusive, more just nicer,

545
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,560
more actively respectful.

546
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,800
And so, it comes with this, right?

547
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,000
I mean, Google, I think, worldwide

548
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,400
is known as one of the companies

549
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,280
that are very openly advocating

550
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,960
for healthier debate

551
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,480
and more supportive ecosystem

552
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,160
and more inclusion.

553
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,080
So, that comes as no surprise.

554
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,720
But I'm sure that it has to be

555
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,680
an interesting experience

556
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,960
living in company of X,

557
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,720
going through Y and Z

558
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,600
and coming back to W.

559
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,680
And then, all of a sudden,

560
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,840
it's like you're back in the same place,

561
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,720
but you've gone through all these

562
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,440
incredible transformations yourself.

563
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,920
Going through leadership at a startup.

564
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,800
Creating and selling a startup yourself,

565
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,000
and now back and working in this domain.

566
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,840
Leor, we're almost out of time.

567
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,360
I can't believe it.

568
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,120
But I have to ask you

569
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,400
the most important question.

570
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,800
Three words that you would use

571
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,880
to describe yourself.

572
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,160
So, Thoughtful.

573
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,280
Critical.

574
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,000
And Helpful.

575
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,400
At least, yeah, that's how

576
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,880
I would like to describe myself.

577
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,440
I love it.

578
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,240
Leor, toda raba.

579
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,640
Thank you very very much.

580
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,720
It's been a pleasure.

581
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,280
And just as a fun fact,

582
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,560
you just mentioned before this talk

583
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,280
that you're one of the founders

584
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,720
with my father and Amir, and Eyal

585
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,480
of Google campus, Tel Aviv, which is,

586
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,160
That's right.

587
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,200
An awesome awesome surprise to hear.

588
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,760
It's so fantastic.

589
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,560
Yeah. Yeah.

590
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,040
It's a funny connection.

591
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,600
We had Michal on the show,

592
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,600
Michal Waltner Levi weeks back.

593
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,760
And we had Amir Shevat

594
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,840
as our first episode.

595
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,440
And so, I'm slowly building the,

596
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,240
You're crossing the names off your list.

597
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,800
Exactly.

598
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,040
Take care. Thank you very much.

599
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,000
Bye. Thank you.
