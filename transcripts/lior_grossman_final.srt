1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,200
And I think it's a good example

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,800
of sometimes, you can find a real gap

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,320
in the market in something

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,560
that is like very niche.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,360
Like it would never become

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,928
a billion dollar company, obviously.

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,600
Lior Grossman, thank you

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,040
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,600
Welcome.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:46,920
Thank you.

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
Thank you for having me.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,400
Thank you very, very much for being here.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,240
All the way from sunny California

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,240
to the dark and stormy Tel Aviv.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,080
But, you know, it's interchanging

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,720
and both places have wonderful weather.

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,880
Lior, an expert in open-source.

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,800
I think you founded like

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,720
five or six companies in this world.

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,440
And it's unbelievable

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,640
not all of them in this world.

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,640
But I know that that's

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,720
what OpenBase is about

24
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,760
and some of the others like

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,800
Wikiwand and something like that.

26
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,840
But I would love to first hear

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,880
about your journey here,

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,480
about who you are

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,440
starting all the way back

30
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,560
when you built your own computer

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,360
within your car.

32
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
And I have to say

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,720
that when I buy a car,

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,640
the first thing that I look at

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,800
is the multimedia screen

36
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,480
and you actually built one for yourself.

37
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,400
So, tell me about that.

38
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,360
Right.

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,320
That's a crazy story, actually.

40
00:01:33,321 --> 00:01:36,560
So, my first car,

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,440
it was a blue Peugeot 106.

42
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,480
Kind of like, I think it was like

43
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,200
the '97 model.

44
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,080
And back then in the days, like,

45
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,280
it's a really old car.

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,680
It didn't have like a multimedia system.

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,880
And being the computer geek that I am,

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,720
I decided to do something about it.

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,960
So, I ended up

50
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,600
actually building a personal computer

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,520
that sits in the trunk of the car.

52
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,320
It's connected like through cables

53
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,840
all of it run all through the car.

54
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,840
And I ordered a touch screen.

55
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,000
Touchscreen was like a thing

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,680
like back then,

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,960
like in the early 2000.

58
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,440
So, I actually had to order one

59
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,120
from eBay.

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,560
Got it all the way,

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,760
built it into the dashboard of the car.

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,520
And basically every time

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,000
I would start the car,

64
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,120
it would start a personal computer

65
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,280
sitting in the trunk.

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,480
It would have multimedia,

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,840
it would have music,

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,520
it would have Wi-Fi, everything.

69
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,800
This was kind of

70
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,080
a very crazy hobby project

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,040
I would say.

72
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,920
Unbelievable.

73
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,520
`I love those types of projects.

74
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,000
It's really amazing.

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,480
Tell me a little bit

76
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,080
about your startup journey.

77
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,600
I know that you were a team leader

78
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,160
in one of the elite units in the IDF.

79
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,240
And then you go and you go

80
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,320
and you built a massive

81
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,280
portfolio of companies,

82
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,200
each of them in a different space.

83
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,520
All of them making a huge impact.

84
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,200
Walk me through some of them

85
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,640
before we reach Openbase

86
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,040
and the open-source industry.

87
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,360
Sure. So, I have been

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,280
I would say a late bloomer

89
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,147
as entrepreneur.

90
00:03:16,148 --> 00:03:19,800
So, I think, you know,

91
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,640
I would say my focus

92
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,480
has been mostly

93
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,400
on entrepreneurship

94
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,720
for the past decade or so.

95
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,280
But you know,

96
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,080
God, I'm old.

97
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,520
So

98
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,200
basically, I got into entrepreneurship

99
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,720
by building my own

100
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,960
software development firm.

101
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,120
So, around 2007,

102
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,680
I started my own

103
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,840
software development firm.

104
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,440
It was called Openbase.

105
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,160
I've been working

106
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,000
with wonderful, wonderful clients,

107
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,800
most of them small startups,

108
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,120
and I helped them get to market

109
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
with their products.

110
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,960
And this has revealed the world

111
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,200
of entrepreneurship to me

112
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
in the world of startups

113
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,760
and how fascinating it is.

114
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,080
And the kind of like challenges

115
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,240
they had around product,

116
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,360
around go to market,

117
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,200
around uncertainty.

118
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,760
And that's how I kind of like

119
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,040
got enchanted and

120
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,360
got into this world of startups.

121
00:04:14,361 --> 00:04:16,120
So, I would say in the past decade,

122
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,640
I've probably build

123
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,560
in one capacity or another,

124
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,680
probably build a dozen products

125
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,400
at the very least, maybe even more.

126
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,720
Some of them were,

127
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,560
kind of like, you know,

128
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,920
entirely bootstrap.

129
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,440
Most of them, honestly,

130
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,040
were it's complete failure.

131
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,000
I think that's part of the process.

132
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,320
Some of them were more successful.

133
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,160
A couple of them more actually

134
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,360
have came to become profitable businesses

135
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,440
that are still active

136
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,200
and they generate revenue.

137
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,640
They have a lot of happy users

138
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,840
and I'm very proud.

139
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,440
But I think it's all part of the journey,

140
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,040
kind of like being able to fail

141
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,680
and learn from your mistake

142
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,960
and kind of like not repeat

143
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,880
the same mistake twice

144
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,440
and improve as an entrepreneur over time.

145
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,800
So, previously, I build BookAuthority,

146
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,640
which is

147
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,560
basically a recommendation website

148
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,440
for books, if you will.

149
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,040
It's like good Goodreads.

150
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,960
But we base our recommendations

151
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,600
based on experts, like

152
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,840
people like Elon Musk,

153
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,880
people like Jeff Bezos,

154
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,640
recommending books.

155
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,840
And we highlight

156
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,160
the most recommended books

157
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,960
on our platform.

158
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,760
So, this BookAuthority

159
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,080
has quite a lot of traction.

160
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,400
I think almost a million users a month,

161
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,840
a lot of recommendations,

162
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,200
a lot of books sold.

163
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,480
Yeah. That's a great, great,

164
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,760
great example of like dogfooding.

165
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,000
Because I set out

166
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,560
to build BookAuthority

167
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,760
to solve my own problem.

168
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,880
I was looking for great books to read

169
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,920
and I was sifting through

170
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,960
like articles on Forbes and Ink.

171
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,240
Eventually, I couldn't find

172
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,600
the most recommend the books

173
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
so, I ended up building this database.

174
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,000
I love it.

175
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,640
That came to be BookAuthority.

176
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,200
I just love it.

177
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,560
That type of stuff inspires me

178
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,320
just like what you did

179
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,760
with the PC for the car.

180
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,880
My father was at Google.

181
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,560
He didn't never had time

182
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
to listen to articles

183
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,400
and he had a pipeline of hundreds,

184
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,000
if not thousands of articles.

185
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,440
And he said,

186
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,480
"Why can't the phone read those out to me

187
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,880
with the push of a button

188
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,440
or by with the assistant??

189
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,240
So, he developed an app within Google

190
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,040
that is now used

191
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,160
by a lot of people around the world

192
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,800
that reads articles for busy people

193
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,640
as they're driving

194
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
as if it's a podcast.

195
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,720
But I digress.

196
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,800
But that is the exact type

197
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,040
of entrepreneurship and innovation

198
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,240
that really inspires me.

199
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,840
Tell me a little bit

200
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,520
about Wikiwand and Darkness,

201
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,360
because those are also

202
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,240
two fascinating ventures

203
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,320
that I'd love to learn more about.

204
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,600
Yeah. So, Darkness

205
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,240
is an interesting example of,

206
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,040
I would say, a gap in the market.

207
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,400
So, nowadays,

208
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,600
you would notice like,

209
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,160
today a lot of websites

210
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,280
and apps offer dark themes.

211
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,560
So, you would have it like on YouTube

212
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,280
and you would have it

213
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,320
in Facebook more recently.

214
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,680
And now I think, you know,

215
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,960
you have it in Google

216
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,818
in beta, basically your search base

217
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:14,720
in a dark theme.

218
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,560
But I started Darkness

219
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,360
a few years ago.

220
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,120
And at this time,

221
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,320
I knew how much I love dark themes.

222
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
And then kind of like

223
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,960
from my other products,

224
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,120
I kind of realized a lot

225
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,560
of other people around the world

226
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,840
love the concept of like

227
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,360
browsing websites through dark themes.

228
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,880
People sometimes are like night owls.

229
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,920
They like working at night.

230
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,560
A bright screen is like very glaring.

231
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,000
It's not fun to use. And also you have

232
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,240
this coolness factor

233
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,280
about like working with a dark theme.

234
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,480
So, I decided to build Darkness.

235
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,040
Darkness is an extension

236
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,240
for chrome that allows you

237
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,280
to convert, to transform,

238
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,560
I think about like 20 websites

239
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,280
to be dark themed.

240
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,080
And we support like Google, Facebook,

241
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,240
YouTube, like many other websites.

242
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,920
And we had quite a lot of success.

243
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,120
We were actually featured

244
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,120
in Chrome web store,

245
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,720
we got a lot of downloads.

246
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,960
The product itself is

247
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,040
kind of dual in depth like

248
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,520
it is an open source product

249
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,280
so, you can use

250
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,520
the open source version,

251
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,240
download it for free,

252
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,880
get like all the features,

253
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,440
get it installed on your computer.

254
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,680
Or you can download it from

255
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,960
a Chrome web store,

256
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,040
where it's a freemium product

257
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,600
in a way

258
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,560
where you have the basic features said.

259
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,240
But if you want to get like

260
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,280
the full possibility,

261
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,680
basically get access to like

262
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,640
20 different websites,

263
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,360
seven different themes, you pay.

264
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,200
Basically, that's like a micropayment.

265
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,360
We don't charge $99 an hour

266
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,800
for a chrome extension, obviously.

267
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,520
But the nice thing about it

268
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,120
is that we had tens of thousands

269
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,120
of paying customers for Darkness.

270
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,440
So, it has become quite a success.

271
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,520
And I think it's a good example

272
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:01,640
of sometimes, you can find

273
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,880
a real gap in the market

274
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,920
in something that is like very niche.

275
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,720
Like it would never become

276
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,640
a billion dollar company, obviously.

277
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,520
But I ended up like

278
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,080
solving my own problem,

279
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,120
and on the way,

280
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,200
solving the problem

281
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,640
for hundreds of thousands

282
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,920
of other people around the world.

283
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,240
Unbelievable.

284
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,680
I remember when one of the developers,

285
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,600
and I was also at 8200,

286
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,440
and I remember the day

287
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,480
that one of our developers,

288
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,720
his name is Gilad,

289
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,480
he brought it into the unit

290
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,720
dark theme for a lot of the applications.

291
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,360
And I remember everybody

292
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,720
was going crazy.

293
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,280
For some reason,

294
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,760
engineers and developers love dark themes.

295
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,680
Now it's actually become a common.

296
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,520
I think that iOS launched

297
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,800
their dark themes recently.

298
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,640
But you know,

299
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,080
I love that idea

300
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,440
of solving your own problems again.

301
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,760
And what about a Wikiwand?

302
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,240
What is that about?

303
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,400
So, Wikiwand.

304
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,280
I started Wikiwand back in,

305
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,520
it was 2013, I started it

306
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,800
with Saar Wilf, which is an amazing,

307
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,120
amazing serial investor,

308
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,240
one of the best angel investors

309
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,440
in Israel, I think.

310
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,680
And the idea behind Wikiwand was that,

311
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,440
again, there is this huge gap

312
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,080
in the market.

313
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,960
So, you have Wikipedia.

314
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,960
Wikipedia is one of the top 10 websites

315
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,200
on the Internet in terms of like usage.

316
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,280
You have like hundreds of like

317
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,400
tens of billions of users

318
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,520
using Wikipedia all the time.

319
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,400
And the funny thing about Wikipedia

320
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,200
is that it's so frequently used,

321
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,320
but it is a product

322
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,760
that hasn't evolved

323
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,920
for the past decade.

324
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,200
It hasn't evolved at all

325
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,320
in terms of like the user experience,

326
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,200
the usability, the feature set,

327
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,400
it's still the same old Wikipedia.

328
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,120
And we're all like

329
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,560
very frustrated by that.

330
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,400
So, we decided to basically

331
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,640
we build Wikipedia for the modern user.

332
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,640
So, like, you would get the same content

333
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,440
that you get on Wikipedia,

334
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,200
but with better readability,

335
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,360
with better search, better discovery,

336
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,560
power features, customized ability.

337
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,320
One of the things we had early on,

338
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,680
it wasn't that popular back in the days,

339
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,280
but we had a dark theme.

340
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,800
So, you could customize your interface

341
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,240
and select the dark theme for Wikiwand.

342
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,600
And we ended up growing

343
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,000
really, really fast.

344
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,080
Wikiwand, we ended up winning

345
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,720
the 2015 Webby Award

346
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,800
for the best user experience

347
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,240
on the Internet.

348
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah, yeah. The Webby Award.

349
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,440
And yeah, this is like

350
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,720
thanks to the amazing team.

351
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,680
Like we have Saar and Ilan,

352
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,160
and Tomer, our designer like

353
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,040
the team, we're a small team,

354
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,000
kind of like doing amazing work

355
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,360
around like buildings product.

356
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,800
It has become a huge success.

357
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,560
We have over 10 million people

358
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,360
using Wikiwand every month

359
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,240
right now, it's a profitable business.

360
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,920
Yeah, it's a pleasure to use ,honestly,

361
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,120
more that I'm proud, like, you know,

362
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,120
proud with the correction.

363
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,320
I'm proud that it's

364
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,920
a product that I enjoy use

365
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,960
and we know so many

366
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,960
people enjoy using Wikiwand.

367
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,640
Wow. Lior,

368
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,800
we'll get to the Y Combinator experience

369
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,160
and open base and how you're solving

370
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,080
a pretty big problem for developers

371
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,840
with so many open -source opportunities.

372
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,880
But I have to gauge your passion

373
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,240
for solving problems with product.

374
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,600
Sometimes they're niche,

375
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,160
sometimes they're not so niche.

376
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,080
But what is it about solving problems

377
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,760
with great people

378
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,880
that really gets you excited?

379
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,960
Because you've done it so much.

380
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,320
You've been successful

381
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,360
in almost all of them,

382
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,560
which is incredible.

383
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,880
But why do you do that?

384
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,760
Why not just go start

385
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,040
a billion dollar company 10 years ago?

386
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,800
I think it's about like in a way,

387
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,680
it's a lot about

388
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,080
the journey of entrepreneur.

389
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,040
And I wouldn't say,

390
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,960
you know, I build a lot of failures.

391
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,920
And like there's always this

392
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,840
I would say survivorship bias

393
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,760
where like you learn about the successes.

394
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,600
But I could fill up

395
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,720
an episode of an hour

396
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,840
about all the products that I built

397
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,040
and were never successful.

398
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,200
And I think it's important

399
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,200
for other entrepreneurs to hear about it

400
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:20,520
because it's not always

401
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,680
like sunny and roses.

402
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,120
And a lot of things that I build

403
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,880
were like downright failure.

404
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,920
And some of them more like, you know,

405
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,560
a mild success, and some of them

406
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,080
like were a bigger success.

407
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,800
And that's part of the journey.

408
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,720
But I'm kind of like digressing.

409
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,640
I think for me,

410
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,640
building products or like creating

411
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,400
is part of like my invocation.

412
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,960
This is not a job.

413
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,280
This is not even a hobby.

414
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,960
I recall even when I was younger,

415
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,440
before I got into programming,

416
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,360
before I got into entrepreneurship,

417
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,280
before I had the skills,

418
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,040
I always loved creating things.

419
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,760
Whether like drawing schemes

420
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,320
or coming up with inventions

421
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,040
and stuff like that.

422
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,720
So, for me, that's not even a choice.

423
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,000
I think that's just the way I work.

424
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,200
I don't see myself doing anything else by

425
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,600
but creating,

426
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,200
but building products.

427
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,440
I just love that.

428
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,360
So, Y Combinator, Openbase.

429
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Solving a problem

430
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,840
in the open-source space.

431
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,080
Before we even talk about open space,

432
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,360
what is open-source?

433
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,200
What is open-source

434
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,800
and why is it a growing field today?

435
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,880
So, open-source is kind of like

436
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,360
an amazing phenomenon,

437
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,240
I would say, in software development.

438
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,720
So, I've been developing software

439
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,240
for a while,

440
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,440
probably since I was 10.

441
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,680
And software development

442
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,160
like two decades ago

443
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,480
was very different from today.

444
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,920
So, two decades ago,

445
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,160
if you were to develop

446
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,760
a complicated rich piece of software,

447
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,240
you had to develop

448
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
every little piece yourself.

449
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,640
Right.

450
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
And that means like you have a product,

451
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,520
you have a tooltip,

452
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,160
you have a, so like a dialogue

453
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,720
that you want to display,

454
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,920
you want to handle text manipulation.

455
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,440
All of these as a developer,

456
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,080
as a company,

457
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,360
you had to develop yourself.

458
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,600
And the open-source movement

459
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,520
was kind of revolutionary.

460
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,040
And that other developers,

461
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,714
developers around the world

462
00:15:21,715 --> 00:15:24,000
started working collaboratively

463
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,600
with other developers

464
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
and sharing their source code,

465
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,000
what they've built with other developers.

466
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,520
So, now as a developer,

467
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,680
you can tap to the collective knowledge,

468
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,200
collective power of millions

469
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,840
of other developers around the world.

470
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,360
And when you build software nowadays,

471
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,000
actually the statistics are astounding.

472
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,360
So, more than 50% of a modern app,

473
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,640
modern product, modern website

474
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,120
is comprised of open-source code.

475
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,720
And less than 50% is actually built by

476
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,960
that person or company.

477
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,000
So, I think the wonderful thing

478
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,800
about open-source

479
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,400
is that it allows company

480
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,880
to focus on their core competency

481
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,040
on their product, while utilizing

482
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,000
the collective power of open-source,

483
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,640
so, they don't have

484
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,600
to reinvent the wheel.

485
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,240
They don't have

486
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,320
to keep like building this dialogue

487
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,720
and this text parsing,

488
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,840
and this like, those accounting functions,

489
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,440
because other people have done this.

490
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,040
So, in a way they're standing

491
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,320
on the shoulders of giants.

492
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,240
That makes a lot of sense.

493
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,440
So, what is the opportunity

494
00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:30,880
that you realize in that gap?

495
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,000
Because as a developer,

496
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,840
when I write and,

497
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,640
I'm actually surprised that

498
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,040
it's not more than 50%,

499
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,600
because when I go into

500
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
write an application,

501
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,000
if it's a relatively simple application,

502
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,720
I think maybe 80% of the code

503
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,680
that I end up having is importing

504
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,600
a code that much smarter

505
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,840
and more intelligent engineers built.

506
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,280
But what what is the gap

507
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,400
that you found in the market

508
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,720
that led you to start Openbase

509
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,880
and have that great opportunity?

510
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,480
So, I found myself

511
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,920
and developers around me

512
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,760
spending so much time researching

513
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,880
and evaluating open-source packages.

514
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,760
And the thing is,

515
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,840
it wasn't an issue a decade ago

516
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,160
because you only had

517
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,840
a couple of packages to do every test.

518
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,760
Whereas like today,

519
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,200
if you look at the JavaScript ecosystem,

520
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,840
you have almost 1.5 million packages

521
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,360
to choose from.

522
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
And that is basically a jungle.

523
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,440
It's very hard to choose

524
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,000
the right package.

525
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,880
And even if you know specifically

526
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,440
what you're looking for,

527
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,280
you're looking for a specific task

528
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,560
to accomplish, you have hundreds

529
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,120
of competing packages to choose from.

530
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,000
And this begs the question like,

531
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,240
how do you choose the right one?

532
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,280
So, I was spending

533
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,240
a significant amount of time

534
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,160
each and every time

535
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,240
I was looking for an open-

536
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,280
source component.

537
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,000
And then speaking to other developers,

538
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,560
I found it like, you know,

539
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,120
I'm not the only crazy one.

540
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,720
In general, developers

541
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,000
spend a lot of time

542
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,560
sifting through packages

543
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,440
and trying to find the best one for them.

544
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,000
Right.

545
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,320
And that's why I set out

546
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,720
to build Openbase, that was

547
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,720
May of 2019 last year.

548
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,520
And it's been quite a wild ride since then.

549
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,612
I can't even imagine.

550
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:20,000
In a few sentences, tell me about

551
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,440
the Y Combinator experience?

552
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,880
Because that by itself

553
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,920
is one of the most

554
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,040
sought after experiences

555
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,800
of any entrepreneur.

556
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,840
Yeah. So, the Y Combinator experience

557
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,880
has been amazing.

558
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,840
So, we were actually the summer

559
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,760
2020 batch of Y Combinator.

560
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,560
That has been

561
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,720
the first fully remote batch of YCE.

562
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,400
I think the amazing thing about it

563
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,640
was seeing so many international founders

564
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,240
from all around the world like,

565
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,320
you know, entrepreneurs are

566
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,240
entrepreneurs, like the same people

567
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,000
kind of like struggle

568
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,720
with the same problems,

569
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,800
trying to achieve the same objective.

570
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,600
So, this was an amazing experience.

571
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,400
We had an amazing set of partners in YC

572
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,680
So like, help work us

573
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,800
through some of the growing challenges

574
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,560
of Openbase.

575
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,080
I think they managed

576
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,560
to pull off something like this,

577
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,800
like this was the first remote batch

578
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,000
and they managed to execute it

579
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,320
so well, you know.

580
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,440
Starting from like the office hours

581
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,440
and the day to day

582
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,400
and the kind of people

583
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,720
they kind of brought on

584
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,840
to talk to the startups.

585
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,120
And the demo day itself.

586
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,400
Demo day was quite a feat,

587
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:30,960
because, like,

588
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,120
you have so many startups pitching,

589
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,440
thousands of investors live on Zoom.

590
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,560
Getting all of that to work flawlessly,

591
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,120
that is like quite a feat.

592
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,680
So, this has been

593
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,440
once in a lifetime experience.

594
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,240
That's for sure.

595
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:44,960
I can't even imagine.

596
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,640
What are some, perhaps,

597
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,480
your two cents from a great summer

598
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,080
that you would take with you

599
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,880
moving forward with it,

600
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,760
or advice that you would give

601
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,920
to young entrepreneurs?

602
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,280
So, I think, you know,

603
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,240
maybe paradoxically,

604
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,440
my biggest advice will like take away

605
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,800
from YC is, for example,

606
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,520
I was speaking with some YC partners,

607
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,840
I was speaking with one partner

608
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,960
and getting this advice,

609
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,560
and I was speaking

610
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,360
to the other partner

611
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,280
and getting this other advice.

612
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,240
And both of them are

613
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,160
like you know, super qualified,

614
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,440
highly successful entrepreneurs

615
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,560
with a lot of experience

616
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,200
that has seen like hundreds of startups.

617
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:29,640
So, my advice would be,

618
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,480
take any advice with a grain of salt.

619
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Because I think the further you go down

620
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,320
the rabbit hole of,

621
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,920
like building a startup,

622
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,040
the more specific your startup becomes.

623
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,320
So, you need to take any advice

624
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,080
within the right context.

625
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,800
And I think generic advices

626
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,840
are great when you get started.

627
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,160
But the more you go in,

628
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,320
the more you have baggage,

629
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,800
the more you have specific circumstances,

630
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,560
you would need a very specific advice.

631
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,240
So, what I did

632
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,320
is kind of I utilized the advice

633
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,800
to give me perspective.

634
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,240
And it was always like,

635
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,200
great, because that was like

636
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,520
a fresh perspective

637
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,080
or like a way of seeing things

638
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,600
that I've never thought about before.

639
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,040
But it doesn't mean that

640
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,760
I take this advice at par value.

641
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,680
It doesn't mean that, like,

642
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,200
you know, this person tells me,

643
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,040
yeah, I think that this could work,

644
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,120
this could not,

645
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,680
I'm not taking it at par value,

646
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,040
but whether I'm synthesizing

647
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,000
all the data that I get,

648
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,440
I sort of like build the map

649
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,200
of the full gamut

650
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,720
of all the possibilities

651
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,800
of the things that I can do.

652
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,000
And I think this is something

653
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,960
that YC was really useful.

654
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,320
Kind of like showing

655
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,360
the full gamut of things

656
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,680
that you can do at each stage.

657
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,240
But then, as the CEO,

658
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,920
it's my own responsibility

659
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
to come up with a choice.

660
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,840
You cannot outsource your choices

661
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,920
and your decisions to someone else

662
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,960
that gives you advice.

663
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,280
100%.

664
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,360
Lior, I want to thank you

665
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,040
for being so generous with your time.

666
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,440
This was great.

667
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,680
Before we leave, I have to ask you

668
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,760
the most important question,

669
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,960
which is three words

670
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,000
that you would use to describe yourself.

671
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,960
Wow. So, that's a great question.

672
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,600
I would say, first is,

673
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,040
I would say I'm ambitious.

674
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,600
So, I've always been

675
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,080
and I think, you know, it's part

676
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,640
of the thrill for me

677
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,400
to pursue big goals.

678
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,560
The other thing is resourceful.

679
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,320
Because I'm always like even through,

680
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,040
like, tough times,

681
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,200
even when things are hard,

682
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,280
I'm trying to find the right path

683
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,880
moving forward instead of, like,

684
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,440
regretting or looking back.

685
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:40,880
Right.

686
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,680
And I think that's like

687
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,680
a very helpful thing as entrepreneur.

688
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,320
And the last but not least,

689
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,600
I would say creator.

690
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,280
Because that's my passion.

691
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,080
That's my invocation.

692
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,200
That's what I love doing.

693
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,960
I love creating.

694
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,200
Lior, this was great.

695
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,960
Thank you very much.

696
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,040
Thank you for the inspiration.

697
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,240
Best of luck with Openbase.

698
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,280
I can't wait to use it myself

699
00:22:59,280 --> 00:22:59,880
as an engineer.

700
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,680
But thank you very much.

701
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,720
And stay safe and stay healthy.

702
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,320
Thank you very much.

703
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,440
Thank you for having me.

704
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,120
Of course.
