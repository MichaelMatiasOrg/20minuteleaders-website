1 All right! Mor Chen, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Thank you for having me, Michael. I’m very happy to be here. Really great to have you. So, you’re calling from Israel, from Tel-Aviv? Yeah, true. It’s Shavuot here. Yeah! Happy holidays! Yeah. So, going to eat a lot tonight. Wonderful. Wonderful. Yeah. I’m very jealous. My family is having a wonderful dinner right now. And hopefully, next year this time, I can be with them. But with COVID, we’re learning that everything is virtual. So, trying to also embrace that. Yeah. I’m sure you did the Passover also via Zoom together with all the family. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Really unique. So, Mor, it’s such a unique privilege to speak with you. I went through 8200 for 5 years. You’re running EISP, which you’ll tell me what it’s about in a second. But it’s very, very relevant to 8200. But you also have a very technical background yourself as software engineer from VMware. And I’m fascinated to hear about your intersection between running an incredible community and accelerators, such as EISP, while also being technical yourself, and how does this all relate to also women in tech, which is also something you’re very passionate about. Let’s just get started. What is EISP? Yeah, perfect. So, we're starting from the end, actually, but we’ll get to the beginning probably again. So, the EISP is a startup accelerator in Israel. It was founded by the 8200 Alumni Association 10 years ago when actually the ecosystem in Israel -- it was already a good ecosystem but there were not so many formal programs for entrepreneurs in their early stages. So, it was one of the first. And it is one of the leading ones in Israel today. Yeah. So, we -- early staged entrepreneurs helping them build and grow their ventures. And we have some great companies in our portfolio. So, why is 8200 a part of it, because my understanding is that it’s not exclusively for the 8200. And for anybody who doesn’t know 8200, it’s the cyber security considered like the elite unit of the army for the computer nerds like we are. True. So, I think like when the Alumni Association started to think about activities and what they can do in the Israeli society and help Israel society -- so you said it's a very elite tech unit. But then, when you look at the industry, a lot of the startups that were founded in -- and the good ones in Israel were founded by 8200 Alumni. So, it was very natural to think about the entrepreneurship and the innovation ecosystems, and see how we can contribute there. And then, at first, they thought about, okay, so within the 8200 unit, you get great skillset. You get great experience and you get a great network, which helps you along the way throughout your career. And also, once we get to it, you will see how it also help mine. But the other people who are not necessarily serving in these units, Yeah. they do not benefit from the same -- being part of this community. So, the logic was let’s do the other way around. So usually, alumni association, they work for their own alumni. And the 8200 Alumni Association decided to work for Israel community and society as a whole and taking this closed network of 8200 alumni and open it to any Israeli entrepreneur. And this is kind of the DNA of the program and the alumni association itself. Very nice. Okay. So now, how are you related to that --? And you mentioned that it also very much impacted your own upbringing into the tech world. True. So, I think that ever since I was very, very young, I was always very passionate about tech. And I always thought that I would like to pursue a career in tech. So, obviously I know that you’re also an 8200 alumni, so you know. So, when I was like 16, I started the process to get in track in today’s Israeli defense forces. And after passing so many interviews and exams, I was accepted to the 8200 unit. I did the intelligence force there, which really opened my mind to the wonderful things you can do with technology. After the army, I studied also Computer Science and Statistics. So, I wanted to get more the theoretical understanding of how things -- how to think correctly about solving problems in general, but also specifically like tech problems. And then, I was working for a while as a software engineer. I think that along the way, I understood that a lot of the skillset that I gained from being a software engineer could also benefit in other roles and other industries. And then, I wanted to tap into the more -- - the business – - A little bit about that though, Mor. I had to stop you. Yeah, that’s fine, actually. This idea -- because I agree completely. This idea that the skillsets you’re getting as a software engineer are indirectly very relevant to a lot of other industries. What’s your take on that? So, I absolutely agree. And along the way, and throughout my career, I think time and time again, I see that this is true. So, basically everyone thinks that being a software engineer is like programming. But it’s more than that. It starts with getting a vague problem. You have to do something that you don’t necessarily know how to approach to or what to do, and then doing it very efficiently and doing it -- So, you have a vague problem. You have to break it into little components. Think about each of them. Do a lot of iterations. Make it better. Make it more efficient. And then, I think once you have that logical and very structured way of thinking about problems in general and approaching challenges, if you know how to also implement that in other industries and in other roles, so this really help. So, after working as a software engineer, I went to strategy consulting, which is almost 180. And there, I really saw it because you’re coming... You're coming for a very short while. You’re joining a company for like three months and you have like an enormous scope of work. Your work is like you have to basically come up with a new strategy to a company who is working for 30 years. Everything is great. They are growing, but now, something is missing or there -- they want to be better. And then, you have to understand how to break it and understand where are the -- what are the main issues, what hypothesis you can make. Challenge all kinds of assumptions that they have. And this way of thinking really helped me also as a strategy consultant. I mean, this whole idea, this magnificent idea that you’re taking a huge, huge problem, anything in life -- it can be an algorithm, but it can be a leadership position or strategy. And this methodology of breaking it down, of divide them and conquer, and then piecing them together back to understand everything is manageable. It’s only a mindset of how efficient they are able to divide it, and then conquer it. I think that’s just phenomenal. So, you went to strategy. You did those consulting, which I think is -- That’s definitely something that I look forward to experiencing one day as well because you’re coming in, you’re getting these really interesting insights. And then, you go into the accelerator phase or the community phase, right? So -- yeah... So, this is almost the story. This is very -- So, I always knew that in some point, I would like to take the experience that I’ve gained as a business and strategy consultant and go back into the tech world because this was my starting position. This is really who I am, basically. And then, I didn’t know how it will connect, but I knew it will connect at some point. I actually planned to go and pursue an MBA. - Really? - But then -- Yeah. But then, I met Sharin, which you know very well. She was the previous managing director. My ancestor, let’s say. [laughs] And she -- We met. And then, she offered -- like a few months after we met, she offered me this role, which totally changed everything for me because I was really on a -- like, I already had my application written. [unclear] did everything and it was like around August, which is very close to the deadlines. And then, it took me like a few -- I think like 48 hours to think about that and I felt that this is exactly the opportunity that I’ve been waiting for in that time in my career, to take a tech experience together with my consultant experience, combining them to assist the early-stage entrepreneurs. And I’m very happy that I did that. So, Mor, how many entrepreneurs did you get to work with personally throughout your time at EISP? So, the ones that were part of like the cohort that I led, around let’s say, 30. But then, obviously, we support our alumni community, which is like 120 startups in different stages, different verticals, which is a whole different challenge. And then, on my spare time, if I have that, I like helping other entrepreneurs who did not -- who were not accepted to our program. I think it’s very important to give them the proper feedback and try to help if you have the network and the experience. Try to help wherever you can. Amazing! No, I actually have two great friends who did the program recently, Tomer Zuaretz and Imri Hecht. Oh, I love him. Wow. Oh, man. He actually sat next to me in the army for about a year and a half. We were on the same team. Incredible. Incredible people. And they just mentioned how incredible the program is. So, what are sort of the values that you bring into the program? When you look at an accelerator and you look at the 150 entrepreneurs that have gone through this program, what makes it unique versus any other accelerator that just aims to kickstart the progress of these early-stage startups? Yeah. So, I think, first of all, is the reputation that we have. - Yeah. - And the -- We’ve been operating for 10 years. There are, I think, very little like other startups -- not a lot of startups in the Israeli ecosystem that have been operating for that long. And this means that we have a lot of experience. - So -- - Yeah. from cycle to cycle, year to year, managing director to other, we really -- We evolve. We learn. We’re getting better. So, I think today, if you ask – More than that, Mor, I think you actually have the opportunity -- unlike other accelerators, you see the whole life cycle from inception to, potentially, exit because the average life cycle of a startup is seven to nine years. So, you actually get to now debrief over your initial cohorts and see, "Okay, what happened over these seven to nine years?" True. So, we have the data and we’re following the data. And we’re seeing like -- Wonderful. We’re trying to learn from that, which companies we can help and which companies we -- We did the right -- We selected them properly. And we have some companies who already -- as you said, they already exited. And I think -- So, first is the experience, your reputation. Second, it’s the network. So, we’re not only approaching 8200 alumni, but the background is 8200 alumni. And within that network in Israel and also in Silicon Valley, San Francisco, and all around the world, there is a strong community which is very united. I’m sure you’re taking part in the activity of the community. - Definitely. - Yeah. So, we -- we really -- they’re really up for the challenge to assist entrepreneurs. And whenever I approach someone from the network, they’re always, always happy to assist---- opening doors, giving consultation, mentoring the startups, which is a really great network to have for entrepreneurs. We’re a non-profit organization, which is different from other startups. It’s very different from other accelerators, right? It’s very uncommon. True. Every year, we think about that, whether we want to raise a fund and start investing or we want to be -- we want to stay a non-profit. So, we do not take equity. We do not invest, which is nice. But I think that, more than that, it means that we are -- we don’t have a specific agenda. We really want to do what’s best for the company. I think that if you’re backed by a specific VC or backed by a corporate, so obviously, you want to promote their agenda or their specific requirements. And here, really, if an entrepreneur wants to raise money, he doesn’t have any obligation. I will introduce him to all the VCs that are relevant to him and all the investors. And if he’s not committed to any specific VC, which I think is really great -- and if – In Israel, as you know, now with the situation, everything shifts a bit. But money is not an issue if you’re a good entrepreneur. It’s just come to the investors at the right timing. And sometimes, if you go to an accelerator, it means that you still need to be -- you need to be -- to do some polishing. But you have amazing raw material. And then, if you go to investors, then you would probably won’t get the best deal. So, I think that getting money from accelerators is not necessarily the best thing for the company. Yeah. Well, my que -- So, I’m going to challenge you on that because I’m wondering – Go ahead. Do you think that there are some startups that might be hesitant to join or to apply to 8200, to this accelerator because of the fact that you’re not taking equity? Because they might feel that if you don’t have a stake in their company, then maybe you’re not going to give them as much attention as other accelerators, or that you’re not going to be as advocative in helping connect them? Or is that not even a worry for startups, because a -- because this accelerator is one of the best well-known accelerators in the country? Yeah. So, that’s a good question, actually. We always ask the other way around. We always think that -- So, you’re asking if -- because we’re not putting money or taking any equity, so we will not invest -- we will not do our best to help them – Maybe [inaudible] both. I don’t know. Yeah. I’m not sure if that’s a concern. I never heard an entrepreneur who is worried about the program because of that. And this leads me to the already good results that we have talking to -- even if you talk to Tomer, I’m sure he will be able to tell you -- And he was one of our -- He’s amazing. I’m sure he would have succeeded without our help. But being able to introduce him to so many investors and also potential customers was really -- I’m sure it really helped him. But I don’t think -- I think if they do have any -- if entrepreneurs have this concern, they talk to me. I’m very, very approachable. I love talking to entrepreneurs or other alumni in our portfolio. And then, I’m sure they won’t be worried about that. Oh, I love it. At the end, it’s all about what’s actually happening on the field and I’m seeing all these incredible things that you’re doing for the startups. I’m observing in social media. And I’m talking to Tomer and Imri, and all my friends who are doing it and it’s li -- it is one of the best run accelerators that I’ve seen. There are so many accelerators that people come out and they tell me, “Michael, we did this. "We actually quit accelerators." "We feel like, 'Ah, it was worth it,' and 'not so worth it.'” I only heard rave reviews about what you’re doing there. We just have a few minutes, and I thought this was a shame. But I’d love to get a little bit about your passion for women in tech. And then, I’m going to -- and then, we’ll shift it to a few more things that I have in mind. Ah, so let’s go. Let’s try to do it quick. 20 minutes goes by really fast when you enjoy – - Time flies. It’s unbelievable. - Yeah. [laughs] So, women in tech. So, one of my personal passion is about that. So I'm a woman, I'm coming from tech. I know how -- most of my time, I was one of the few during university. Then looking at the industry, there are only around 3% in Israel, 3% female entrepreneurs. This is something that I care deeply about. And I think starting with education, where I believe you need to start there; so teaching young girls, opening their minds - to this kind of field. - How young do they start? At what age do you think is important to really get in there? From like age zero almost. Yeah, so all the way from the beginning. - into this -- it's -- okay. - Yeah. Like exposing them to things that are more mechanical, scientific. And then, also obviously, encourage them to explore these ideas as parents and as educator. I’m actually asking that because I read recently, a very interesting study that showed that actually up until a certain age, girls outperform boys in STEM. But I think at around fifth or sixth grade, there are these social norms that are starting to divide the groups. And a lot of scientists are saying that if we can dive into that key moment in the middle school when they have these cliques, maybe that will help change the situation. I’ll send it to you later. I thought it was very interesting. Oh, I’d love to read that. So, it’s very complex, obviously, because also, as you said, there is this social environment. At the age of 10 or 11, if you’re not with other girls, you might feel a bit different or strange. But then, obviously, I think you should start from the beginning. My father is very feminist. He was always like that, which really helped me I think from a very young age to understand that there is -- I can do anything, basically. I just need to understand what I want to do and where is my passion. But I think that starting with the parents, this is the point where you should start encouraging girls explore these areas. I love it, Mor. Last question. Well, actually, I lied, I have two more questions. But for now, where do you see yourself in like 10, 15 years? Curiosity -- I mean, are you doing a startup? Are you going into -- working for a big company? Where’s your passion? Wow! Wish I was brave enough to start a startup. It’s so crazy. I really admire entrepreneurs. No, no, no, after each -- after you’re seeing all these people go through it? So, I do, but I think I like being an entrepreneur and being a -- like taking initiatives within a more structured environment. So, this is where -- like at the moment, this is where I feel more -- like, this is where I feel comfortable. So, definitely continue to work with entrepreneurs. I’m not sure how exactly, but definitely I’m super -- I love working with entrepreneurs, like seeing them, how they are passionate about what they’re doing, trying to change the world and how I can assist doing that definitely fulfills a lot of the things that I’m looking for in a career. I love it, Mor. - Now the last question, finally. - Yeah. [laughs] I need three words that best describe you or that any of your startups would describe you as. [laughs] I’m sure these would be different, three words. So, I think I’m very -- I’m ambitious. I have very high emotional intelligence. And I think that I’m very Israeli - in every sense of the word. - Yeah, I agree. Yeah, yeah, really. [laughs] Mor, this is -- I’ve done it with quite a few Israelis. This is the first time I’m hearing that as a word. I just love it. Toda raba. Thank you so much. Toda. I really enjoyed getting to know you. Really enjoyed. - Thank you. - Take care.
