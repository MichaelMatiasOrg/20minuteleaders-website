All right. Jordan Blashek, how are you? Oh, I'm fantastic. Thanks for having me on. I already enjoyed so much speaking before this. So, I'm so excited for the show, and I purposely didn't ask too much because I'm ready to hear now. Jordan, you have such an extraordinary life path. From being an infantry officer, to studying at Princeton, Yale and Stanford, law degree and business degree. And I can't even grasp my mind over it. You're writing a book which is coming out soon. But actually, by the time this is aired, they will already be out. Talking about America and the polarization, or hopefully, I hope there are some optimistic note. We'll see. And now, Schmidt Futures. And I can't wait to hear all about that. And lastly, venture partner at J-Ventures, where I am also at. So, this is just all wonderful. Jordan, how do you get to go to these three incredible institutions? How do you get to be an infantry officer in the US Army? Yeah. Well, it's funny you say that. Every time I talk to Israelis, I feel like I am so under accomplished. Because by the time you guys even go to school, you've already done so much in your lives. And that's true for you, too. And I've had a great few years. You and I shared a lot. I was the first associate at J-Ventures when it was just J-Angels. And it was one of the best experiences I've had at Stanford. I have [--] to fill right now. This is very scary. No no no. You have far surpassed me already. But I guess, so, my journey started back in California. I grew up in Los Angeles. Son of two Jewish parents who wanted nothing more than for me to go to medical school and I get to college. I sort of, like a good Jewish boy, decide I'm going to go to medical school. And my junior summer, I was working in medical clinics in India, and just realized that I actually didn't want the medicine side. But I really did love being out in austere environments and working with local populations. And so, I decided coming out of that, that I wanted to join the US military. And after looking around, I found that the Marine Corps was the group that I really wanted to be a part of. They have such amazing esprit de corps. Every Marine is so proud to be a Marine. Wait wait wait. Remind me Jordan, which of the three institutions was your undergrad? Oh, I went to Princeton undergrad. So, at Princeton. How common is it for somebody at Princeton during their studies to decide that they're going to join the US Army? I think my year, we had about five of us who all joined the military. It's more than I thought. Okay. Interesting. Yeah. It was around 2009. And at that point, we had watched all these generations go off to war. And I think, there was a sense among a lot of us, and this was true across my officer cohort, that there were a lot of people who were just very inspired over the couple of years before. And so, we were all very passionate about serving the country, idealistic about it. And so, there was a good number who went. And so, I ended up joining the Marines in 2009. I went through officer training. And by the end, decided I wanted to be an infantry officer. So, I went to the infantry officer course and then ended up doing two deployments. One to the Horn of Africa, doing counter piracy and counter terror missions. And then, another to Afghanistan, where I was an adviser to the Afghan army. Oh, my God. Okay. I need one short story. I know it's impossible to just ask for one. But I need one story. Whether it was from the officer's training or, from one of your deployments. Something that taught you, something that you were taking with you until now. That's always the fun, the most fun. Oh, that's a great question. I think the lesson I learned from officer training, especially the infantry officer course, the Marine Corps does a fantastic job of training young leaders. And the one thing they want you to learn is to operate under uncertainty. And so, the infantry officer course time from start to finish, is just one uncertain event after another. They'll wake you up at three a.m. and send you off on missions where they won't tell you what's coming three hours later. And I think, the value I gain from that over time, which is being very comfortable without knowing what's coming next. And in every job I've had since, it's just been very valuable to know that through persistence, I can just figure it out. And to be able to make decisions under uncertainty. And the Marine Corps just did a fantastic job for training that. Unbelievable. I remember I climbed Kilimanjaro with my father and brother about a year ago, exactly, and on the climb I read, "Extreme Leadership", by two people that were very high in their ranks and they saw me. And I remember just how impressed I was with this mindset. And obviously, having gone through a military training of my own, I don't think it was as intense and probably a little much less intense than what you've experienced. I was much more in the typing. My finger got injured. That was the biggest injury I had. But that's incredible. Okay. So, you do that. And where do you go from there? How do you how do you get then to do law in the Yale, and then business at Stanford? Yeah. So, around 2013, and it was sort of increasingly obvious to a lot of us that the wars are winding down. And, if the wars were running down, at least for me, it sort of, began to lose a bit of its idealistic purpose. And so, if the wars weren't going to be there, I decided it was time to move on. And it didn't come from a desire for combat, but it came from the sense that there was a lot of mission and purpose when we're preparing for war. If we weren't doing that, it wasn't going to feel quite as visceral. And little did I know that a year later we'd be back at war with ISIS. But either way, I made my decision and decided to leave. And so, I wanted to go to graduate school. I knew that over the long term, I wanted to do two things in my life. I wanted to be able to engage in the world of ideas and policy. And I also wanted to start companies. And so, I decided with four years of the GI Bill, that it would pay for school, that I would try to do law and business. Because law would give me that ability to work in the world of ideas and policy. And business school would help train me for a career in the private sector in creating companies. And honestly, I think, there's something about veterans who come out of the military and feel that the world outside the military is so foreign. You don't really know what's happening out there. So, we decide to go to grad school. Or, to go to college. And I've seen that through a lot of my friends leaving the military. That there's almost this desire to like arm up with degrees because it's your world afterwards. And so, I ended up doing that and getting the two joint degrees. I think that's so interesting. In the Israeli military, every day you see one of your friends getting released because everybody's in the military. And there's always this initial shock where you ask them on the day that they're about to leave the base, like, how are you feeling? Are you excited? And almost all of them are saying, "We're terrified." "We're excited that we're finished, but we're terrified." And then you meet them the next week at a coffee shop in Tel Aviv, and they're having the time of their lives. Already working on their second startup. And the assimilation is quick because I think, everybody goes through the experience. So, they're able to talk to a lot and lot of people who have gone through this. So, you get your law and your business degree. You're  also an associate at J-Ventures. And I'd love to touch upon this book that by the time this airs, has already come out. Because it's touching on something that I became very passionate about, studying with Larry Diamond at Stanford this year, talking about the polarization within the United States. How do you go then, because you've done this in the past just two years, right? Writing the book. So, what drives you to go and think critically about community within the US and where we're at now? Yeah, and so, I started this while I was at Stanford Business School. and it was also at the same time I started working for J-Ventures, and I started working for Eric Schmidt of Schmidt Features. And I think to your point, before leaving the military, I felt like I needed to go to school. I needed to get some credentials and arm up with more information. But very quickly realized that at that stage in my life, that the best information I would get would actually come from working, and in going out and experiencing things and learning on the job. And so, by the time I got to Stanford, I focused mostly externally and was trying to find opportunities where I can learn the skills I really wanted to learn. And with J-Ventures I got to learn about what it looks like to do due diligence on companies. And how to think about the markets they're moving into, and how to look at a team and evaluate whether you want to make a bet on this group. And with Eric Schmidt, I learned some incredible lessons about how I think about things at scale or how to take ideas from good to great or collaborate with different groups of people. And separately, this was around 2016, and clearly something was happening in the country. There was a lot of division and the country seemed to be convulsing under this weird political environment. And I decided I wanted to see it firsthand. So, instead of learning about it through the news or in classrooms, I wanted to see it on the ground. So, you go in, you get into a car and you just drive. Yeah. And the first few trips started just for fun. My friend and I wanted to be on the road. And so, we took some of our breaks in and picked a few places we wanted to visit and just out on the road. And while we're out there, you just see the country different. It's big and beautiful. And everyone you meet is hospitable. And you learn something from them. And we, also, learn from each other. And being in a car for long hours, my friend Chris is a hippie from Berkeley, I'm a conservative Marine, and we had such different world views. But over long conversations, we were able to untangle all these common values that we actually had underneath it all. Even if if we were just having a debate with friends, we would seem to be at odds on everything. When we were really able to give it time, and with humility, we found that we shared all these common values. And where we did it, we learned something about ourselves. We learned what blind spots we had or what presuppositions we were coming to arguments with. And, so the heart of our story ended up being the things we learned about each other and our friendship, and the things we learned about the country through the people we met. And so, the book is this argument for what still binds us together, despite all the political division today. I think that's so wonderful and so optimistic. One of the incredible things that I was so inspired by learning this year with Larry Diamond, was this experiment in, one America in one room he had. Where he brought in hundreds of people from a random group to Texas, to a hotel, into the venue, and over three days they had them converse in a very humane way. And all of a sudden, what inspired me most was, not that they change their beliefs sometimes, but that Democrats began seeing Republicans as instead of enemies, as people that they can converse with and have some common ground with and the same vice versa. And I mean, that was the hopeful message here. And that's why I'm really really looking forward to reading the book. But Jordan, I want to talk about Schmidt Futures. Because one of the things that I saw is that you're very into impact investing. Right? And Eric also, all the way back from Innovation Endeavors is all about investing and looking at things that are moving the needle. What is impact for you and why are you following that route? Yeah, it's a great question. So, for me, there are things I care about. I care about the future of America and I want to see it healthy. That's a lot of where the book came from. And I care a lot about the future of security and creating more vibrant, prosperous world, free of war. So, I think something that drove my desire to go into the military. And ultimately, I think the ability for a free democratic society to survive depends on progress. We need to keep growing the pie. If people feel like the pie is shrinking, if people feel like we're static, then it becomes very zero-sum. And it's very hard for our democratic systems to survive in that kind of world. And so, there is this imperative for us to drive progress, and that's progress in the fields of science and technology. It's progress in our understanding of human rights and civil rights. And that's what we do at Schmidt Futures. We look to advance scientific frontiers. We try to advance technology's impact on society, and we try to advance shared prosperity and national security. And we've taken a sort of unique approach. And we're very lucky to have Eric Schmidt as our founder, who believes deeply in this. And he pushes us not to think necessarily about returns, but to think about the talent we're backing and how we're transferring risk from them to us. And so, his theory and our theory, is that the way to achieve progress is to go find exceptional people who don't have a track record yet. And because they don't have a track record, others aren't really willing to invest in them. So, venture capital firms won't invest on the riskiest ideas because they're not proven out in the market yet. Government won't invest in very high risk research and development because they're using taxpayer dollars. And so, these ideas are people that don't yet have track records, have a hard time getting the capital to test their ideas. And so, what we do is we try to look for those exceptional people. People who but for our investment, they wouldn't be able to do or try the thing they want to try. And then, we make bets on them and we give them risk capital. We don't take any equity from it. It is purely for the impact they can create. And then we try to support them through helping build teams around them, giving them support and mentorship, and watching through teams and talent. And support they achieve their breakthroughs. And, if it doesn't work, it's okay. We'll support them again on their next try. And in doing so, by transferring that risk off them to us, we think will lead to a lot more breakthroughs in the world. Wow. Okay. So, I mean, the idea of a venture capital is that you invest in, let's say, 10 companies a year. Hopefully one of them will return 10X and then you're balancing out and you're able to continue doing that when you're giving risk capital from no equity or essentially, I mean, you're just diluting the same pie that you had initially without putting in more. So, it sounds like you have to even be more risk averse as you're going through your journey, than in traditional venture capital. And you're betting on people. You're betting on talent. How do you go about doing that? I mean, so what does that mean to be head of talent within Schmidt Futures? Yeah, it's a great question. So, as head of talent, I oversee all of our internal talent development. So, because we want to bet on talent, we also think internally we have to have the best team. I'm responsible for everyone we have. And then, we have a number of talent programs. So, we have an entrepreneur in residence program. We have a Science Fellows program, and APM program. All of these are designed to go find exceptional people and channel them into certain areas that we think are underrepresented with that kind of talent. And so, for instance, our Science Fellows program is trying to produce more interdisciplinary scientists. We don't think there's enough of those. Even though all the breakthroughs we're going to see in the next few decades are going to come on at the intersection of Fields. We combine things like computer science and biology that you get these interesting breakthroughs. And so, our program is designed to do that. Similarly, we don't think there's enough computer scientists in the philanthropic world. And so, our APM program is designed to take computer scientists and then put them on moonshot type ventures in the philanthropy world. And so, I oversee all those talent programs. And, I think the reality is no one has really cracked the code on how you can rigorously test for talent. There's still somewhat of an art to this. And everyone on our team has developed their own methods for how you find that. And for some people, it's they have almost like archetypes in their head. Just like in Hollywood, there's specific roles in movies that you look for. And we think in the talent world, there are specific archetypes that if you find them, they're really worth betting on. And so, there's the genius generative type who they just see targets differently. And as a result, they're constantly coming up with new ideas. But that person might be terrible at managing a team. And so, if we can find that genius and then pair them with a highly talented operator, someone who just like the chief of staff type function in the military, they just know how to execute. Then that's like a dynamo combination. And so, a lot of what our team does is try to find, there's different archetypes or try to find ways of testing for genius or generative ability, and then finding the right pair so that you maximize their potential impact. Wow. Okay. That's just, I mean, to me, it sounds like a dream job. I mean, sitting there and trying to think how can we be bet on moonshot ideas by moonshot people, that have a chance to succeed in this. And we want to join their journey and support them, and doing that without taking equity, and without thinking about the capital side of things, but embracing the talent that they have and, at the end, making a positive impact on democracy and the country. I think that's just incredible. Jordan, what excites you most? I mean, you're seeing so many different talents, and you're seeing so many different projects. You're constantly embracing this idea of moonshot in impact investing. What do you get most excited about? Yeah. So, I get really excited when I find someone who has this incredible combination of just raw talent. They're very talented. They care deeply about an issue and they have the specific skill set and unique insight to go solve it. And the reason I get so excited about that is it's actually really rare. It's very very rare to find someone who just care so much about an issue. And they've really figured out a specific insight into how you could solve it. And they happen to have the right skill set in order to do it. And when you find that person, it's like unlocking a code that just can change the game. And we found a few those at Schmidt Futures. And it's like the greatest joy to find that person and then get to help them do whatever it is they're going to do. Because the amount of change and impact they have is so fast and so quick once they get the support they need. And so, yeah, I get really excited about that. There's one person in particular who I always love to talk about. Her name is Clem Jacoby, who was a Google PM, and became obsessed with the criminal justice system. Because her uncle had gone to prison multiple times. And she had this insight into how you can change the criminal justice system and she's going to do it. And with a very small check from us, she's now raised over $10 million. She's operating in all 50 states. And she will change the criminal justice system in the US. And that all happened in one year. Like in one year, she did that. So, that's what I get excited about. Wow. And how long is usually this process? As meeting new people, and as you were hearing about their talents, and, you're actually forming a much more meaningful relationship about that person. Not just about the how good is the market and what are the likely returns. You're putting that effort that a VC might put and you're navigating it towards that person and their motivation and their abilities. So, how long does that usually take you? It varies by person. And it varies on the kind of person we're getting on. But someone like Clem, it was almost immediate that we realized like this person special. Let's see what she can do. And so, often we'll start with a smaller check just to test them to see, with a little bit of money what can they do. And if they're able to get some traction and show us that they really have the ability to do whatever it is they say they want to do, then we'll go bigger on them. And so, that first check could be within a couple of weeks of meeting the person. Wow. Jordan, it sounds like a dream job. Definitely wait for my resume one day, that I want to come and thank you and learn as much as I can. But before we leave, and I can't believe 20 minutes almost up, I have so many more questions to ask you. This is so bad. I need three words from you. And then I have one more question that I'm gonna have to squeeze in there. I need three words that you use to describe yourself. Three words to describe myself. Yes. It's the hardest question out of all of them. That is very hard. Okay. I'll go with Persistent. Freckly. I have a lot of freckles, you might not be able to see them. And Patriotic. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. Okay. The last question. And this is actually going to be my favorite one. Leadership. You've seen leadership across academia, across military, across venture capital, what's a common theme? What is something that you see that keeps coming up no matter where you are in the world, no matter what you do? Because I'm guided by this idea that, leadership isn't when you're in the boardroom. It's not when you're in front of your companies. It's everywhere you walk, every move you do, you need to act as a leader and you need to think of yourself as a leader. But so, what are common themes that you're seeing? Yeah, to me, the most important leadership quality and the most consistent one I've seen in great leaders, is they just genuinely care about the people under their command or under their charge. They just they truly love them and they'll do anything for them. And leaders who have that quality, they end up putting more time and effort into the things they do. Because it comes from that place of care and people feel it. You can feel when someone genuinely cares about your well-being and your future. And the best leaders do that. And they do it just because that's who they are. I love it. Jordan, thank you very very much. This was inspiring and I look forward to continue learning from you and reading your book and maintaining this relationship. This was wonderful. This was, and it was my pleasure. Thanks so much for having me. Thank you. Take care. Bye bye. All right. Bye.
