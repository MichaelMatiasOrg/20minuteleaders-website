1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,959
I always prefer to do something

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,119
than not to doing something.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,919
So whenever,

4
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,799
even when wake up in the morning,

5
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,959
I want to go jogging or not

6
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,959
and I am tired,

7
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,199
I'm not going to jog today.

8
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:10,999
But I remember that

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,159
whenever I'm doing something

10
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,159
or when I do something,

11
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,227
I never regret.

12
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:43,119
Dotan Knaan, thank you for joining me

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,119
on 20 Minute Leaders.

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
How are you today?

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:46,999
Good, good.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,559
Nice to meet you.

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,639
Happy to be here.

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,879
Thank you. We have a lot to cover.

19
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,839
But before we cover all the mileage

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,599
we have for this interview,

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,440
we have to talk about your bike journeys.

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,880
You started by mentioning to me

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,360
that you traveled with your wife

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,560
with 10 some of the bikes

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,080
all across Europe,

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,520
and you even traveled

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,640
with the whole family

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,440
on a non-competitive cycling event

29
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,920
through Iowa, right?

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,640
Yeah, yeah.

31
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,400
Bike is me. I am the bike.

32
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:18,279
So, also in the Silicon Valley

33
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,159
I used to bike every day

34
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,080
to work and back.

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,160
Here in Israel, now I'm in Israel, also,

36
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
we are in Tel Aviv

37
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,800
because in Tel Aviv,

38
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,920
you can cycle also everywhere.

39
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:33,919
So, I try to avoid my car.

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,720
And also it's good

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,640
because my son is very,

42
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,840
he's protesting against the

43
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:42,039
climate change.

44
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,559
So, I'm very proud to

45
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,760
that my son can be proud of me,

46
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,080
that I'm using bike, whenever I can.

47
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,360
And yeah, as a student,

48
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,440
I cycle with my wife for two months

49
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,120
in Europe with bike.

50
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,240
And again, then another trip

51
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,080
and that was in Scandinavia.

52
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,360
Then another time in Scotland.

53
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,520
And then in United States also,

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,000
I cycled of a lot.

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,440
And including with my family

56
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,040
one week we crossed Iowa

57
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,320
from one side to the other.

58
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,040
There is a big event

59
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,920
called, RAGBRAI,

60
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,040
and that was very, very good.

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,080
I'm constantly in awe.

62
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,520
The people that I'm speaking to,

63
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,480
like yourself, you're so busy

64
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,520
and you're so successful in your domain,

65
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,640
yet you have these incredible passions

66
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,760
and adventures

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,960
and you don't do them lightly.

68
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,800
You go all the way.

69
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,560
You traveled 2,000 miles

70
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,600
with your wife with ten.

71
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,080
So, you travel all across Iowa

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,040
with your family.

73
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,680
I'm gaining inspiration for myself.

74
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,640
But I have to go to the main event

75
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,080
and to the main mileage.

76
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,760
You're a researcher at Samsung.

77
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,320
You're an expert in computer vision

78
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,800
in augmented reality.

79
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,880
And I'm especially excited

80
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,640
for this episode

81
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,720
because I'm excited to talk about

82
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,400
what is augmented reality?

83
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,640
And where are we heading,

84
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,360
especially in the context of your work?

85
00:02:58,361 --> 00:02:59,639
So, Dotan, maybe,

86
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,839
can you take me back a little bit

87
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,439
about your journey

88
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,639
into this computer vision space.

89
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,673
And then, tell me a little bit

90
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:07,320
about where we are?

91
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,360
Okay. So, personally,

92
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:11,599
my big one is more computer vision

93
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,279
and also a bit of computer graphics.

94
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,880
And for me, augmented reality,

95
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,000
or virtual reality, we can discuss it,

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,120
but that's why I like,

97
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,640
it is about the integration.

98
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,080
So, you take computer graphics

99
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,160
and computer vision

100
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,720
and integrate them

101
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,400
and have something that you see.

102
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,600
And for me also,

103
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,400
that's also something

104
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,280
that's for me is very important

105
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,600
is the feedback.

106
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,040
So, for me as a developer,

107
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,480
that's I develop something

108
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,320
and I get the feedback.

109
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,720
I don't need someone to tell me

110
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,040
if it's better or not.

111
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,680
I see if it's better.

112
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,360
I see the reality in front of me.

113
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,040
You are the user.

114
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,680
I'm the user.

115
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:48,919
It's not only better algorithm

116
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,759
that runs faster and someone say,

117
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,880
oh, now it's faster, more efficient.

118
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,280
What I like is just

119
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,560
the interaction with the computer,

120
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,720
with the screen.

121
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,120
And if it's augmented reality,

122
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:02,119
virtual reality is not only the screen,

123
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,720
it could be also glasses.

124
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,599
What drew you into computer vision

125
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,039
starting out?

126
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,079
Why going to computer vision?

127
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,520
What drew you into computer vision?

128
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,080
Yeah. So, to computer vision again,

129
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,400
that's because of visual aspect.

130
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,920
Because I see what I get

131
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,560
and understand the world

132
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,240
and how the computer

133
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:29,559
can understand the world,

134
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,040
and how computer can

135
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,440
can learn and it's got just,

136
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,560
I started 20 years ago,

137
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:39,279
even more 25 years ago

138
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,919
and it was not allowed so many cameras.

139
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,240
Now everything is cameras.

140
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,640
Every phone has a camera,

141
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,560
amazing camera.

142
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,400
So, the potential of computer vision

143
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,640
just grew and grew

144
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,760
and understanding

145
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:53,759
of the images much, much better.

146
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,080
And again the direction,

147
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,280
having been being able

148
00:04:57,281 --> 00:05:00,439
to see what you're going,

149
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,160
that's what I like the most.

150
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,120
And what's also very interesting is,

151
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,200
though, because for us, the human,

152
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,560
it's you see something,

153
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:11,239
it's so obvious what you see.

154
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,760
But to teach a computer to understand

155
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,680
what you see, it's a big challenge.

156
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,840
And that's part of,

157
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,080
now, when we have augmented reality,

158
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,480
if you asked about augmented reality is,

159
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,520
you have two parts,

160
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,320
one is understanding the world

161
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,560
because you have to visualize.

162
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,880
So, maybe I'll just give a few words

163
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,280
about what is augmented reality

164
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,000
is also, there's virtual reality

165
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,200
where you see only

166
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,880
the virtual only the graphics.

167
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,760
You don't see the actual world.

168
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,440
You just see everything is graphics.

169
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,600
And there's augmented reality

170
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,400
or mixed reality.

171
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:49,559
There are some differences

172
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,479
between all that.

173
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
But in general,

174
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,560
let's call it augmented reality,

175
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,160
that's you have the world,

176
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,240
but on top of the world,

177
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,680
you have some object

178
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:59,159
that you add some information

179
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,599
to the world.

180
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,840
It could be,

181
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,480
through the screen of the phone like,

182
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,440
on the phone you see

183
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,640
the world with a camera

184
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,320
and also add some information.

185
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:13,319
So, Google has a lot of

186
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,759
the very good tool code

187
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,079
that gives you a lot of information,

188
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,120
you can use it and

189
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,320
it just gets better and better

190
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,360
because you understand the world.

191
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,280
You can understand plan,

192
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:24,920
you can understand

193
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,840
where everything is located.

194
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,280
Personally, I prefer as a developer

195
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,920
to work with the glasses.

196
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,560
In the glasses

197
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
like HoloLens Microsoft and those other

198
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,440
Magic Leap and other companies.

199
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,400
That's for me, that's the magic,

200
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,520
because then you really see the world

201
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,920
and then you also put again,

202
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,040
you put the graphics on top.

203
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,000
That extra layer.

204
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,200
Yeah, but extra layer.

205
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,920
But that's even more challenging because

206
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,800
you really have to understand the scene.

207
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,440
You really have to understand,

208
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,120
not only the scene

209
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:56,559
and where to put something,

210
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,040
but to also attract the head motion.

211
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,240
So, you have to understand

212
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,400
how the head moves.

213
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,880
Because then you can

214
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,520
really know how to render,

215
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
how to locate

216
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,800
the object in the right thing.

217
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,680
And if you don't do it right,

218
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,120
it looks wrong.

219
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,680
So, it's very, we as human again,

220
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,880
is very sensitive to that.

221
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,440
And it's very difficult to trick us.

222
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,040
And you know,

223
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,360
everything it also it has to work

224
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,320
very efficiently in real time

225
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,280
because you cannot have any latency.

226
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,160
That's another challenge

227
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,320
with augmented reality.

228
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,400
The speed should be very, very

229
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,600
processing speed should be

230
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,200
that's everything,

231
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,000
you have to be very efficient.

232
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,520
And every jittering,

233
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,240
in virtual reality you can cheat.

234
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,120
In augmented reality,

235
00:07:46,121 --> 00:07:47,119
you cannot really cheat

236
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,799
because you see,

237
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
again, you can see the road.

238
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,720
And where it is now,

239
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,520
I think most of computer,

240
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,080
many, many companies,

241
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
big companies,

242
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,360
they try and do something.

243
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,000
And for many years now,

244
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,280
it's considered as something

245
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,880
that is the next things.

246
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:08,519
But it's still promising,

247
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,120
more promising than,

248
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,480
you have also Facebook and Google.

249
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,320
And I know some rumors about Apple.

250
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,560
But no one really makes money of that.

251
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:26,240
So, it's still potential because

252
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,559
when you have,

253
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,519
and they call it sometimes,

254
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,639
they call it like a Superman.

255
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,560
Once you have this abilities,

256
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:37,039
even if you don't like it,

257
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,520
that's the claim that in the future,

258
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,400
even if someone doesn't like it,

259
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,960
for example, I see you

260
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,240
and I get some information

261
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,879
that you cannot know about me,

262
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,159
I have some advantage on top of you.

263
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,760
I don't really like the approach

264
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,960
but in general, that's reality.

265
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,520
So, if I have something

266
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,560
that with augmented reality,

267
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,680
going to get more information

268
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,520
than someone without it.

269
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,600
And so, one day maybe,

270
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,240
if you want to be in

271
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,040
and know everything,

272
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,520
you'll need augmented reality

273
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,800
wherever you like it or not.

274
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,719
So, Dotan, I would love to spend

275
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,280
the last five minutes or so,

276
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,480
talking about where we're headed.

277
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,880
Because I am terribly excited

278
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,640
and frightened of how our world

279
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,440
is going to look in a few dozen years,

280
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,240
both in terms of people

281
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:28,239
that are aging and loneliness

282
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,120
especially with covid.

283
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,840
I mean, it's become very apparent

284
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,600
how necessary this technology is.

285
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,280
But before that,

286
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,640
I would still have

287
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,520
to understand a little bit better

288
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,080
what is essentially

289
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,800
augmented reality today?

290
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,720
So, are people really

291
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,760
actively working on this?

292
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,680
Is this mainstream?

293
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,760
And I'm drawing a parallel

294
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,440
to autonomous vehicles.

295
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
I had a great chat

296
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,760
with a product manager

297
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,640
at one of the leading

298
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,800
autonomous vehicles company

299
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,760
on this show.

300
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,440
And one of the things

301
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,520
that she mentioned was that,

302
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,120
we had a big surge of technology,

303
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,000
we've advanced a lot.

304
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,880
And we've reached this like,

305
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,800
95-96% threshold.

306
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,000
And now we're realizing

307
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,360
that the last 5%

308
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,560
is incredibly harder than we thought.

309
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:09,759
And so we're almost there,

310
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,640
but we have such

311
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,760
a big way to go because

312
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,640
that's the big threshold.

313
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:14,399
Is that the same thing

314
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,320
with augmented reality?

315
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,960
I think yes and no.

316
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,600
I think it is yes because

317
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:21,839
if you want something perfect,

318
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,519
there's still a lot of things

319
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,519
to do to make it work.

320
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,519
I think there's a problem

321
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,359
with augmented reality

322
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,519
is the awkwardness.

323
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,519
There's no stable killer applications.

324
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,040
Why would people like Google,

325
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:37,399
when they have the Google glasses.

326
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,639
Yes, you get more information,

327
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,479
but you look awkward.

328
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,360
If there's not enough extra information,

329
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,840
still people are waiting

330
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,160
for this killer application

331
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,320
that is not there yet,

332
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,160
maybe just games,

333
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,600
but it's not enough,

334
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,840
just games and entertainment.

335
00:10:52,840 --> 00:11:00,600
The technology is really,

336
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,840
it's getting there.

337
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,160
It's not too far for something

338
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,280
that you can use but expensive.

339
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,400
So the glasses,

340
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,760
like HoloLens, Magic Leap,

341
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,520
that's something that costs

342
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,680
2 or $3,000 a piece.

343
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,160
That's too much for consumers.

344
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,600
So, that's something

345
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,880
that has to be solved

346
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,240
before people can use it.

347
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,720
Because with expensive ones,

348
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:24,999
you have very good results.

349
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,320
Very, very good.

350
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,360
But if you want something

351
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,640
that is much cheaper,

352
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,640
10 times cheaper,

353
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,680
then checking is not good enough.

354
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,520
But that's the hardware.

355
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,000
I mean hardware

356
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,960
is getting better, cheaper.

357
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,840
The camera is getting cheaper.

358
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,440
I think technology, of course,

359
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:41,959
there's more to do improve,

360
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,200
but I think we're in the right way.

361
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,800
And I get the killer application,

362
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,520
why would people do it.

363
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,160
In the future,

364
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,760
they talking about also lenses

365
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,760
instead of glasses.

366
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,160
You don't see it

367
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,160
but the hardware it's very creepy.

368
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,560
I don't know.

369
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,640
But I think, I believe that

370
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,200
that's something again,

371
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,120
like, even if you like it or not,

372
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,000
It's going to happen.

373
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,120
It's going to happen. Yeah.

374
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,520
Because I'm asking this

375
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,960
very honestly,

376
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,640
because we had such a big hype.

377
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,880
And everybody was talking about it.

378
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,840
We had Magic Leap

379
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,120
that was in stealth mode for so long,

380
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,160
raising so much money.

381
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,240
and then all of a sudden,

382
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,440
you stop really hearing

383
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,040
about these advancements.

384
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,520
You do have Oculus and HoloLens,

385
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,120
but you don't really see

386
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,000
me and my friends

387
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,440
talking about these technologies

388
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:28,479
as much as we did

389
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,439
even five years ago.

390
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,480
Which is counterintuitive.

391
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,320
Because I would expect

392
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,520
that now, we'd be talking about it

393
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,960
much more than before.

394
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,240
I remember going to conferences

395
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,720
and the person with the Google Glass

396
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,000
was the most popular person in the room.

397
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,720
So, what I'm hearing from you is that

398
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,400
I can be optimistic

399
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,800
and I should be planning

400
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:46,399
for a nearby future

401
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,080
when it will be less awkward

402
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,400
and more beneficial

403
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,200
to take part in this new humanity.

404
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,320
Yes, I think that's the directions.

405
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,520
And because, again,

406
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,440
there is so much things

407
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,800
we can learn and do with that

408
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,640
and so much extra information

409
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,120
you can get.

410
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,680
So, I think, sooner or later,

411
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,480
maybe later,

412
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,720
but it's going to happen.

413
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,440
And again, there's also the prices

414
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:13,999
that are going to drop.

415
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,840
I think so many big players out there.

416
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,000
And like you said,

417
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,560
it was very big hype

418
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,080
and some small companies were closed

419
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,000
because it's difficult to get some air.

420
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,480
Right.

421
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,760
But the big companies are still there.

422
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:31,120
And I think it's going to happen.

423
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,999
Maybe not as soon as they thought

424
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,680
but it's going to happen.

425
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,120
So, now is the part

426
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,600
that I'm most excited about.

427
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,240
Where are we heading?

428
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,920
Let's say, 10 years down the line

429
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,040
or 20 years down the line,

430
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,960
what do you envision

431
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,000
our world will look like

432
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,360
with augmented reality

433
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,640
as part of our society?

434
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,080
In a modest expectation.

435
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,960
Given the technology

436
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,240
that you're expecting to grow,

437
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,560
how do you envision humanity operating

438
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,840
or at least places like Tel Aviv,

439
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,080
Silicon Valley, New York?

440
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,160
Okay. So, maybe we have

441
00:14:07,161 --> 00:14:09,239
to separate which one what I want

442
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,399
and maybe what I think

443
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,679
that's going to happen because

444
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,719
it's not that I like,

445
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,159
Yes, I like the technology.

446
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,439
First of all, augmented reality,

447
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,800
like I said before,

448
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:19,679
from the technology side,

449
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,839
as a developer, from contribution

450
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,560
production, integration.

451
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,400
Yeah, but I'm not sure

452
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,240
that there's a use of it I really like.

453
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,160
If I just try to imagine

454
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,880
all this creepy situations,

455
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm not sure I really like

456
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,320
to have it in the future.

457
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,960
It's also scary for me.

458
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,080
But if we just mentioned

459
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,560
this corona thing,

460
00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:50,279
we sometimes go far from the family

461
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,600
being able to,

462
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,480
so that's the good thing.

463
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,080
So, that's the thing that I really think

464
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,440
that are beneficial.

465
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,080
Now, everything is virtual.

466
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,640
We are in Zoom right now,

467
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:02,879
but I want to make a meeting with you

468
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,120
and we want to discuss something

469
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,640
that here is on the table,

470
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,440
and with AR glasses,

471
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,040
we can discuss it.

472
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,360
It's already possible with some

473
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,880
with more advanced headsets

474
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,320
that are too expensive,

475
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,160
like I mentioned earlier.

476
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,960
But now you can already look

477
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,920
at the same object

478
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,680
and look at that around it.

479
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,680
So, I think for high tech,

480
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,920
for many other for professional use,

481
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,640
there are a lot of things

482
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,520
that you can share

483
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,240
and be able to gain a lot of,

484
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,960
and safe like Zoom.

485
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,800
You don't have to meet to do it.

486
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,280
You can do it from home.

487
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,640
And like you also mentioned,

488
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,880
for the elderly people

489
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,600
maybe they can not read

490
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,240
because it's too small.

491
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,000
But now you can,

492
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,520
assuming that you do that in the UI

493
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,560
simple enough and intuitive enough,

494
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,280
that's also a challenge.

495
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,080
Because, we know, If it was computer,

496
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,680
we use the mouse and the keyboard,

497
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,560
we are already used to it.

498
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,800
But with augmented reality,

499
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,480
how to use.

500
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,400
So, there are a lot of challenges there,

501
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,440
the uiPAD.

502
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,600
The technology have hand checking

503
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,000
and head checking, the eyes checking.

504
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,960
None of that was very useful.

505
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,640
It worked, but not so.

506
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,480
If you want to change,

507
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,520
do something like that,

508
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,840
to change the screen

509
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,480
or do something like that.

510
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,680
Hand signs that are not very intuitive.

511
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,040
If we solve that,

512
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,960
I just mentioned that

513
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,040
because we think about old people.

514
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,040
So, if you make it intuitive enough

515
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,840
and maybe hopefully will find a way

516
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,880
to interact with that.

517
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,440
So, family that want to meet each others

518
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:44,719
and together with the holograms

519
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,560
or things like that,

520
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,040
you could really feel like,

521
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,080
so, every time it use augmented reality,

522
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,520
even more virtual reality.

523
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
Sometimes I use it

524
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,600
and then, I when I'm done,

525
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:56,159
I just take my glasses off and

526
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,560
oh, wow, I'm back to the real life.

527
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,040
I'm back to the boring world.

528
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,000
Yeah.

529
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,840
It is so easy to forget

530
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,720
about your environment

531
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,040
when especially with virtual reality.

532
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,599
And that's something that I think

533
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,160
that if we find again,

534
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,600
like some applications

535
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,400
that something that can

536
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,920
do a lot of good to people.

537
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,720
I'm terribly excited about

538
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,960
the prospect of being able

539
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,880
to talk with my grandparents from afar.

540
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,760
Due to covid,

541
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,320
I can't go inside their house

542
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,240
and visit them.

543
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,400
And it kills me inside.

544
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:35,759
And I'm saying like,

545
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,679
why do I need to use video conferencing

546
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,199
on Shabbat dinner

547
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,919
to wish them Shabbat Shalom.

548
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,039
I want to be able to be

549
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,999
in the same room with them

550
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,879
because it feels to me

551
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,119
that were almost there.

552
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,559
And it's so relevant today

553
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,359
and it's going to continue

554
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,239
being so relevant moving forward.

555
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,155
And so, I'm incredibly excited

556
00:17:55,156 --> 00:17:57,722
about this technology.

557
00:17:57,723 --> 00:17:59,015
And one more thing,

558
00:17:59,016 --> 00:18:03,079
there's a haptic feedback.

559
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,919
That's something that is still missing

560
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,999
and that's more expensive.

561
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,079
That's part that is a bit behind,

562
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,199
because you also want to touch.

563
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,599
You want to hug your grandparents,

564
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,199
If you could hug them or something,

565
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,440
And there are some

566
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,319
controllers that just vibrate a bit,

567
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,920
but it's not much more than that

568
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,880
and the better ones are very expensive.

569
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,320
Right.

570
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,640
That's something that has to,

571
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:30,559
maybe in 10 to 20 years,

572
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,080
I hope that this one

573
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,440
will get much, much better

574
00:18:33,441 --> 00:18:34,320
because that will make

575
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,759
a lot of difference.

576
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,520
Right. I just read an interesting review

577
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,720
of the new PlayStation game console,

578
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,880
which the PlayStation 5,

579
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,720
it introduces haptic feedback

580
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,280
through the remote controllers

581
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:45,799
so that you're more immersed

582
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,360
into the game.

583
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,960
And one of the things that they said

584
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,720
and I read a few of the gamers designer's

585
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,880
decision making process,

586
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,120
they said that they intentionally

587
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,480
minimized the use of this new feature

588
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,280
because they were afraid that humans

589
00:19:01,281 --> 00:19:03,439
will not be receptive to it yet.

590
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,280
It will be too much for them.

591
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,720
So, I'm especially curious,

592
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,240
given what we talk here

593
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,920
about how we as humanity

594
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,240
are going to accept this new reality.

595
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,360
And just like you mentioned,

596
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,320
that you take off those glasses

597
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,320
and you're back into the boring world,

598
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,680
or the default world, whatever.

599
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,720
Every person experience it differently.

600
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,800
I think that's fascinating.

601
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:22,959
Dotan, I want to really thank you

602
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,760
for being so generous with your time.

603
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,320
I wanted to talk about J-Ventures

604
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,000
and some of the work that we do there,

605
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,080
but we didn't have time for that.

606
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,080
But I'd love to get from you three words

607
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,880
that you would use to describe yourself.

608
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,520
So, one is very active.

609
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,440
So, I always prefer to do something

610
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,560
than not to doing something,

611
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,280
So, even when I wake up in the morning,

612
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,440
I want to go jogging or not,

613
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
and I am tired,

614
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,680
I'm not going to Jjog today.

615
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,480
But I remember that,

616
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,640
whenever I'm doing something

617
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
or when I do something

618
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,920
I never regret.

619
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,360
I love that.

620
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,240
Even if you regret

621
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,400
I know I'll regret more times

622
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,520
about things I didn't do

623
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,480
than about something

624
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,200
that I want to do.

625
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,960
So, whenever I have to think about

626
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,800
should I do it or not,

627
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,720
my approach is yes, do it.

628
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,680
Like a startup, just do it.

629
00:20:09,681 --> 00:20:10,959
I love it.

630
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,199
That's one thing.

631
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,599
And the other thing is just,

632
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,919
I think I'm very calm.

633
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,959
So, it's very difficult for me

634
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,320
to someone to make me angry or mad.

635
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:27,399
It's very difficult to make me mad.

636
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,519
Maybe that's why I don't have

637
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,559
so much startups,

638
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,719
because I'm calm.

639
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,959
You seem very fulfilled and calm.

640
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,999
And I'm taking a lot of inspiration

641
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,999
from that first word,

642
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,840
being active and not regretting

643
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:47,519
even when your intuition says

644
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,439
maybe this isn't right,

645
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,879
but then you rationalize and you say,

646
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,079
well, I'm more often than not,

647
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,839
I don't regret,

648
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,759
I'm enjoying the experience.

649
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,879
And so, I think that's really wonderful.

650
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,759
Wonderful.

651
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,879
Dotan, thank you very, very much.

652
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,799
Thank you for being on the show.

653
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,319
Thank you for

654
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,959
being so generous with your time.

655
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,439
And I'll see you around

656
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,599
at J-Ventures meetings.

657
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,839
Yeah. See you.

658
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,114
Bye-bye. Nice to talk to you.
