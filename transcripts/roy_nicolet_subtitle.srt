1
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,360
Roy Nicolet, how are you doing?

2
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,880
I'm doing wonderful, Michael.

3
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,360
It's Friday afternoon.

4
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,160
I'm feeling great.

5
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,040
How are you?

6
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,160
I am feeling just fine.

7
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,760
I miss not seeing you on Stanford campus.

8
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,080
Yeah. Well, they closed down campus.

9
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,440
That we're not a long time ago.

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,720
Well, Roy, I'm excited to learn more

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,840
about your journey and share your journey.

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,200
We've gotten to know each other

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,680
quite well over this past year

14
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,640
as you were finishing your business degree

15
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,960
at Stanford Graduate School of Business.

16
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,960
Quite an experience, I'm sure,

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,240
which I can't wait to hear more about.

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
But you have such

19
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,520
a phenomenal life experience.

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,000
And all these different things

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,120
that you've done,

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,280
transitioning from a leader in the IDF,

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,000
to Intel, to studying in the Technion.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,200
So many different things,

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,520
all the way leading up to Stanford

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,520
that I'd love to just

27
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,760
talk about your life, and perhaps,

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,120
touch on the different events

29
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,240
and draw some nuggets

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,000
that you now take with you

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,280
on your entrepreneurial journey.

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,320
How does that sound?

33
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,520
Sounds great.

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,760
Roy, who are you?

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,720
Who am I?

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,480
Roy, I'm 34 years old,

37
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,200
Israeli entrepreneur,

38
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,680
born and raised in Even Yehuda,

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,240
and I think that being Israeli

40
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,720
is a big part of my life.

41
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,320
Why do you say that?

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,240
Why do I say that?

43
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,760
Being Israeli means

44
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,880
you connect yourself with a country,

45
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,440
with your Jewish heritage.

46
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,160
You live it.

47
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,040
You're born as an individual,

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,120
but you experience your country

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,080
and so, such big intensities

50
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,480
from serving your country

51
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,400
and also being pissed about politics.

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,440
I think that it's unique being Israeli.

53
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,920
Of course. 100%.

54
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,960
So, talk to me a little bit

55
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,640
about your experience

56
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,120
at Stanford Business School.

57
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,520
You've started two years ago,

58
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,000
you are coming from Israel,

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,800
you mentioned that

60
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,040
it was almost a life dream

61
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,120
to go there, right?

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,520
Yeah.

63
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,120
So, Stanford Business School

64
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,800
was a life dream of,

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,720
about six years that I plan

66
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,600
to go to Stanford GSB.

67
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,760
And what's incredible about Stanford is

68
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,560
that you interact with amazing people.

69
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,080
You're getting inspired on a daily basis.

70
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,640
You have the professors.

71
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,720
It's really different

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,080
from the Israeli experience

73
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,640
of studying in college.

74
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,800
The professors know you.

75
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,320
They'll have coffee with you.

76
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,920
Hopefully they'll invest in you

77
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,760
in the future,

78
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,680
but they're very very generous

79
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,120
with their time and knowledge.

80
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,960
So, Stanford is incredible.

81
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,440
The people that are being there,

82
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,280
everybody breathes entrepreneurship.

83
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,120
You get inspiration from Silicon Valley

84
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,720
is just this is the place to be

85
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,960
for an entrepreneur, I think.

86
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,120
Okay. So, now I what I would love to do

87
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,520
is to talk about different parts

88
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,160
of your life and the different experiences

89
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,040
that from there,

90
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,480
because just before we started this call,

91
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
you mentioned that looking back

92
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,400
and reflecting on these

93
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,800
different experiences,

94
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,040
good and bad experiences,

95
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,000
you've accumulated these nuggets,

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
that now, as you're creating your startup

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,640
and you're now the founder

98
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,960
of a startup in stealth mode,

99
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,880
now you're using these experiences

100
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,520
to move forward.

101
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,160
So I'd love to open the floor

102
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,600
and let you guide me through

103
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,120
these different adventures

104
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,080
that you've had.

105
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,760
Cool. So, I'll mention that

106
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,560
I'm working on a startup right now.

107
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,600
It's an AI powered startup.

108
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,160
And it's in stealth mode,

109
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,360
so I can't talk about it too much.

110
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,160
But it's my second startup.

111
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,440
And I didn't understand

112
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,640
where the resilience

113
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,960
and not losing hope came from.

114
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
How the hell am I waking up in the morning

115
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,640
and grinding on, getting clients,

116
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,880
getting validation from investors

117
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,200
and getting rejected on a daily basis,

118
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,240
but also continuing moving forward

119
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,680
until I get the success

120
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,440
from every distress.

121
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,120
And I realized that basically,

122
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,760
being an entrepreneur,

123
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,280
the entrepreneurial thing in me

124
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,560
was very much influenced

125
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,720
by my military service.

126
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,280
So, I had a very broad military service

127
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,000
starting from pilot school,

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,840
and then I went to be a tank fighter,

129
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,480
and then an intelligence officer,

130
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,000
in one of the

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,350
intelligence officer positions.

132
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,000
Crazy, Roy. That's just crazy.

133
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,240
From the pilot academy,

134
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,840
one of the most prestigious areas

135
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,920
in the IDF,  going to be in a tank,

136
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,400
which is an extraordinary experience,

137
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,880
all the way to be an intelligence officer.

138
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Another position that is sought after

139
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,000
by so many people going into the military.

140
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,600
Sorry, but continue. I'm just impressed

141
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,560
by the variety of experiences

142
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,520
that you've had.

143
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,040
Thank you.

144
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,560
So my first military officer position

145
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,000
was in a commando unit, Sayeret Golani.

146
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And in Sayeret Golani,

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,920
one of the values is you'll get a mission,

148
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,760
a certain mission.

149
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,320
It will seem unrealistic to perform it,

150
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,440
but you will go and do it.

151
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,280
And you have a certain limited time

152
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,960
to plan your mission

153
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,080
and you'll find so many creative ways.

154
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,120
But at the end of the day,

155
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,400
you'll execute the mission

156
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,960
even if you're not ready.

157
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,440
And that was very very inspiring for me.

158
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,800
You find out in many cases

159
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,440
and every night

160
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,120
that you don't have the solution.

161
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,200
Yet, you need to march forward,

162
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,920
you need to perform the task.

163
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,400
And sometimes just by having the hope

164
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,360
that everything will be fine

165
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,520
and you'll just go and do it, by that,

166
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,880
you did like 90% of the job.

167
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,360
Right.

168
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,720
Right.

169
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,680
Not to say that these are

170
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,400
dangerous missions and entrepreneurship

171
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,600
is way not like this.

172
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,440
But the mentality really taught me a lot

173
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,000
moving forward today.

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,680
Another thing is that

175
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,440
you go to a military mission

176
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,760
and you don't really have

177
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,720
all the intelligence,

178
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,800
you don't really have all the information

179
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,160
about the other side

180
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,640
to execute the mission.

181
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,440
But yet you go and do that,

182
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,720
you take the risk.

183
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,760
And many times

184
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,320
wherever you work somewhere,

185
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,600
whether you lead a company,

186
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,640
you need to cope with uncertainty.

187
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,720
You won't have all the answers.

188
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,040
You won't have all the information

189
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,320
to take a calculated decision.

190
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,960
But this is why people trust us,

191
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,000
this is why people pay us salaries.

192
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,800
So, I learned that, I guess,

193
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,500
in Sayeret Golani, yeah.

194
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,840
That's just incredible.

195
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,880
So, you go through

196
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,160
these experiences in the IDF,

197
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,120
and obviously, as a leader,

198
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,800
there's a lot of analogies to be made,

199
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,880
and a lot of connections to be made

200
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,240
leading a company, a product,

201
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,080
and leading a mission,

202
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,300
leading a team in the army.

203
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,600
And I think one of the special things

204
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,400
that I also experienced in the IDF

205
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,600
was the idea that,

206
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,320
you don't go there

207
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,760
you don't work for money

208
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,400
and the whole promotion ladder thing,

209
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,640
it's so different from the way

210
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,080
that we are in and we really learn

211
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,640
what it means to motivate

212
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,440
and what it means to lead by example.

213
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,960
Those are two of the biggest ideals

214
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,500
of the army, and I'm sure that

215
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,240
you're an exemplary leader

216
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,200
in your startup now

217
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,480
and taking a lot of these

218
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,240
insights from there.

219
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,320
Talk to me about another life adventure

220
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,400
where you've learned

221
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,480
something interesting for your startup.

222
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,500
Another life adventure,

223
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,000
oh, I'm blacking out right now.

224
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,960
When you look at yourself

225
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,720
as an entrepreneur now,

226
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,200
you mention that

227
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,280
there are various experiences

228
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,800
that you've taken lessons from there

229
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,600
and now you're implementing them

230
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,040
in your day to day life

231
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,200
as an entrepreneur,

232
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,280
whether it be rejection or leadership

233
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,960
or vision or creativity.

234
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,480
So, I'd love to get more insight

235
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,400
into what other areas

236
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,120
that you've gained this inspiration for.

237
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,400
Yeah.

238
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,760
So, what I really enjoy

239
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,480
at the end of the day

240
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,960
when I'm working with people,

241
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,040
my co-founder,

242
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,560
the people that we work with,

243
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,480
is not forgetting that they are people.

244
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,560
It's really important for me

245
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,720
to talk to people,

246
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,600
even go to small details.

247
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,200
And that was another lesson

248
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,520
taught by another position

249
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,600
that I had in my military service.

250
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,000
So, I had this soldier,

251
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,200
I will keep his name anonymous,

252
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,160
and he used to come

253
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,040
to my office every day,

254
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,240
feeling terrible.

255
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,360
And I suspected

256
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,400
that something was wrong

257
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,440
and perhaps he was suicidal.

258
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,080
With a lot of heart and dedication,

259
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,000
I sat down with him.

260
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,320
But there are some people who need help

261
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,280
and they are around us all the time.

262
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,600
And what happened

263
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,800
with this particular soldier

264
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,840
that he told me that he wants

265
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,280
to end his life, eventually.

266
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,500
And that life lesson, specifically,

267
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,640
So, I'll tell you that the journey

268
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,280
of being a commander in the IDF

269
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,640
was very very special

270
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,720
when you interact with your soldiers.

271
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,720
So, I have led around 80 soldiers

272
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,480
in my military service.

273
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,600
And as a commander,

274
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,360
you are sometimes their best friend,

275
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,560
sometimes their enemy.

276
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,560
You are representing the system.

277
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,280
A system that forces people

278
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,640
to serve in the military.

279
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,080
Not everybody wants to be there.

280
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,640
Not everybody is an officer

281
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,160
who wants to volunteer,

282
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,760
not everybody does effort

283
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,400
to their careers to be a leader.

284
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,800
And these special relationships

285
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,440
that you have, sometimes you encounter

286
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,480
in situations where you are a psychologist

287
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,520
to suicidal soldier,

288
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,760
or whether you are in a couple of therapy

289
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,400
if your soldiers are dating each other.

290
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,960
You're a social worker

291
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,000
if the background of your soldier

292
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
is from the very hard situation.

293
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,160
You go to their places

294
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,360
and see how they live.

295
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Sometimes they are a pillar

296
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,080
because the military missions,

297
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,040
when you need to sleep somewhere,

298
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,240
you have a tendency to nap.

299
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,840
I think that

300
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,120
what you are touching on here,

301
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,040
which is very very true,

302
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,200
the IDF is a compulsory service

303
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,240
which brings with it

304
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,600
a lot of the challenges

305
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,320
of what it means to lead

306
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,400
within a program like this

307
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,480
where every person enlists.

308
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,200
And then naturally,

309
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,040
when the whole organization is very young,

310
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,360
because the majority of the organization

311
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,960
is 18 to 21 year olds,

312
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,240
you have very young leaders.

313
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,120
So, at the age of 19, you get a team

314
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,000
of eight to 10 people and say,

315
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,840
"Okay, welcome."

316
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,400
You are now their sibling, their parent,

317
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,600
their psychologists, their social worker.

318
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,960
And you have to now, all of a sudden,

319
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,240
understand what that means.

320
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,200
And I can totally relate

321
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,240
to these lessons

322
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,120
that you're sharing about.

323
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,400
About how you're learning

324
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,160
to lead by example

325
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,280
and to be a commander that way.

326
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,080
Now that you've gone through

327
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,400
Stanford Business School as well,

328
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,320
in the school where a lot of the classes

329
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,680
are about leadership and about management

330
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,680
and how to successfully lead a business,

331
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,720
talk to me a little bit about

332
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,760
the differences between

333
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,680
leading a team in the Army

334
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,680
rather than leading a team, perhaps,

335
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,160
at a startup or in a business.

336
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,200
And you've also got a chance

337
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,280
to work at a few companies,

338
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,720
so you also have that experience as well.

339
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,600
Yeah. So, leading people by example

340
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,880
is definitely one of these.

341
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,520
And also understanding that

342
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,800
at the end of the day,

343
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,200
these are people.

344
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,280
You need to understand

345
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,320
what is the motivation behind the people,

346
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,720
even in your startup.

347
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,520
Everybody has their own

348
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,160
need to give an input, need to impact,

349
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,080
they have their own passions.

350
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,120
And learning what is their motivation

351
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,520
is like the best leadership skill

352
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,280
that I learned in the military.

353
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,400
Another thing is working as a team.

354
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,080
So, in many ways,

355
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,840
the social connections that teams have

356
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,840
are really like perpetuate

357
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,040
the energy and commitment

358
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,240
to the company and the mission.

359
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,600
Yeah.

360
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,640
And I think that

361
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,200
it's sometimes overlooked

362
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,720
because people want to work

363
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,720
and they have their work-life balance.

364
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,680
In the military, you live within work

365
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,040
and the people that you're stuck with,

366
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,120
you're working with them

367
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,840
and you go to your room

368
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,480
and you stay with them in the same room.

369
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,320
So, everywhere that I go,

370
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,040
I try to bring that team cohesiveness

371
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,960
and try to lower the guards of people

372
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,880
so they can feel comfortable.

373
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,760
How do you do that?

374
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,920
How do you lower guards of people

375
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,800
so that your teammates

376
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,240
can be comfortable?

377
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,760
So, I believe that encouraging

378
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,720
open discussion.

379
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,160
So, I know that you were an officer

380
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,720
in the Israeli Defense Forces

381
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,960
as an intelligence officer.

382
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:34,280
And we have a big story about

383
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,560
not saying what you have in mind.

384
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,960
You need to always say

385
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,760
what you have in mind

386
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,520
and to think that it's important.

387
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,400
So, you always need

388
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,800
to encourage a discussion

389
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,920
if it's relevant to how we work

390
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,960
and what are we working on.

391
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:53,160
And so, always encourage people to talk,

392
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,680
to be open about these things.

393
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,560
We don't want to hold any aggression

394
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,760
towards the goal or the team,

395
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,640
so this is super important.

396
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,960
Second thing is that,

397
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,000
we need to stay in work

398
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,400
until work is done.

399
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,800
Because eventually,

400
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,640
sometimes we need to deliver.

401
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,400
And some of that military experience

402
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,360
brought me to understand

403
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,920
that I need to stay with my employees

404
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,500
and support them and my team.

405
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,360
Which is something that you see

406
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,880
in the military all the time.

407
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,320
Right.

408
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,360
And supporting them and create a synergy

409
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,000
that they feel more motivated,

410
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,720
they feel supported,

411
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,280
and they're not alone.

412
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,480
100%. I completely resonate

413
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,240
with what you're saying.

414
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,880
Talk to me a little bit

415
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,800
about the GSB experience.

416
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,880
So, you mentioned a little bit

417
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,200
about the entrepreneurship side of it,

418
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,280
about the social side of it.

419
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,360
I'd love to really hear,

420
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,000
because I haven't gone

421
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,080
through the GSB myself,

422
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,280
and so many other friends.

423
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,840
We all really want to.

424
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,960
But it's a little far.

425
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,680
And while we hope to get in one day,

426
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,280
you now have the opportunity

427
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,480
to share with me having just finished it.

428
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,640
So, talk to me a little bit about

429
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,520
the good, the bad and the ugly.

430
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,920
The good, the bad and the ugly.

431
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,360
The good, it's an incredible

432
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,280
open community.

433
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,880
So, the GSB is very special.

434
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,320
People are encouraged to share,

435
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,400
be vulnerable and support each other.

436
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,960
So, that's wonderful.

437
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,000
We have once a week,

438
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,440
we have two classmates doing a talk.

439
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,280
30 minutes dedicated all to them

440
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,160
sharing their life story.

441
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
And you see those people in class

442
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,120
and they are super smart.

443
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,840
And then you go to talk and you hear

444
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,320
incredible stories of growth

445
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,520
facing adversity.

446
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,560
And people are incredible.

447
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,880
Second thing about this university,

448
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,160
that it's really not competitive,

449
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,760
which is good,

450
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,040
so we have a great nondisclosure.

451
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,840
You don't feel any competition.

452
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,840
People are just helping each other.

453
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,880
Which I think is interesting

454
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,640
because it's extremely competitive

455
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,360
to get into.

456
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,320
The acceptance rate

457
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,000
is one of the lowest in the world.

458
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,320
Yet the second you're in,

459
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,440
you're a part of this community

460
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,320
that you're saying

461
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,840
it's not competitive, right?

462
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,760
It's true.

463
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:13,520
And, it's the lowest percent

464
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,480
out of getting in the programs.

465
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,800
And this great non-disclosure

466
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,320
allows people to just

467
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,120
not think about race, just study,

468
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,240
be focused on their friends,

469
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,560
get together, collaborate, take risks.

470
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,240
It's encourage you to do mistakes

471
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,720
because eventually you will graduate.

472
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,800
Right. So you mentioned

473
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,720
a few times also to me,

474
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,840
outside of this is that

475
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,840
the part of the magic of the GSB is that

476
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,480
you have all these people who are coming

477
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,720
from extremely different backgrounds.

478
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,520
You're coming in

479
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,000
as an officer from the IDF,

480
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,240
you have people coming in

481
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,560
after they've run businesses

482
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,240
around the world

483
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,920
or had different adversities

484
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,040
that they've overcome.

485
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,760
And when you come into an institution

486
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,480
that there are no grades are involved,

487
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,960
you each have your own personal grade,

488
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,280
but the goal at the end

489
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,400
is to graduate together as a community

490
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,840
and to build relationships

491
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,680
that will expand way beyond the campus,

492
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,920
but in the real world

493
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,640
and in the business world, right?

494
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,320
Exactly. I will move to the bad.

495
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,280
The bad thing is that it's only two years.

496
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,840
It's only two years. I love that.

497
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
It's only two years.

498
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,520
So, it's a paradise for education.

499
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,240
You're getting inspired every day.

500
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,920
It's a tremendous growth.

501
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,560
Like I was basically half vacationing,

502
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,960
traveling with friends.

503
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,160
And still I feel like I boosted my career

504
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,600
and grew as an entrepreneur

505
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,960
and only two years.

506
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,480
I wish it was cheaper and longer, I guess.

507
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,720
Was it worth working for six years

508
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,000
to get in for this two year experience?

509
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,160
I believe so.

510
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,920
I'm pretty biased, as you know.

511
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,920
I've put a lot of money

512
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,760
in this program, too.

513
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,800
So you have to believe that

514
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,840
it gives you something.

515
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,240
But looking backwards, two years ago,

516
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
coming from Israel,

517
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,840
even with my fluent English,

518
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,920
I didn't know how it would grow me

519
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,880
to be where I am today.

520
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,320
I feel comfortable fundraising now

521
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,280
with top VCs, collaborating

522
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,320
and selling my products to clients.

523
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,800
That boosted my confidence greatly.

524
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,840
And so I'm grateful for that.

525
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,480
Also, this community's incredible.

526
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,960
So much knowledge, so much grace,

527
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,520
people are helping all the time.

528
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,160
Which I think it's really really,

529
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,800
I wish my alma mater, Technion,

530
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,040
would be more like this.

531
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,240
That people would collaborate more,

532
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,800
the alumni network.

533
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,040
We have so much time in Technion

534
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,480
and they still haven't picked up

535
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,600
about building a community

536
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,840
that helps their members.

537
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,600
I think that

538
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,720
the interesting thing is that,

539
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,480
in Israel,

540
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,160
the equivalent of the community experience

541
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,400
of a university is your army unit.

542
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,720
Because when we go to

543
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,320
the average bar in Tel Aviv,

544
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,280
you don't really ask,

545
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,120
"Hey, where did you go to school?"

546
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,440
You ask,

547
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,960
"Hey, which unit did you serve in?"

548
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,740
In the US, obviously,

549
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,120
it's the first question.

550
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,440
And so I think that it's so interesting

551
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,520
to see two different communities,

552
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,320
two different countries,

553
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,000
two different incredible countries

554
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,400
with people growing up in different ways.

555
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,240
But at the end,

556
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,280
it's all about the community

557
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,410
and it's all about the people.

558
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,400
Roy, one thing you mention to me,

559
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,120
which I would love to bring up,

560
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,600
you told me that

561
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,520
every really amazing CEO

562
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,920
has their shtick,

563
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,000
they have their thing.

564
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,440
And you ask me,

565
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,280
"Michael, what is it going to be

566
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,080
your thing?"

567
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,200
Well, Roy, I'm going to turn

568
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,760
the question to you,

569
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,720
because this is about you.

570
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,120
What is your thing as the CEO?

571
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,480
Cool. So, I'll go wild and I say that

572
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,280
I'm going to be the jungle CEO.

573
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
So, every CEO is crazy.

574
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,720
My office's going to be all about nature.

575
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,480
We're going to have trees,

576
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,200
we're going to have animals

577
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,520
jumping around, monkeys, tigers

578
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,160
running in the office.

579
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
And I'll be,

580
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,000
Elon Musk is a space guy,

581
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,440
I'm going to be nature guy.

582
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,000
What are you going to be?

583
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,520
I have no idea yet.

584
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,640
I 'm going to see how yours plays out

585
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,000
and then I'll make my decision.

586
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,960
I mean, you've also really inspired me

587
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,840
to be more conscious

588
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,520
about my eating habits and meditation.

589
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,440
And it's not just about nature,

590
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,800
I think one thing that

591
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,920
I've gotten to know about you

592
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,440
over this past year is this idea

593
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,600
of like being of inner collectiveness

594
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,800
and an inner calmness

595
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,080
and really being in touch

596
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,800
with who you are.

597
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,600
So, I want to thank you

598
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,080
for bringing that to my attention,

599
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,920
because both of us reflect often

600
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,040
on how driven we are

601
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,440
and how much time we spend

602
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,440
on racing to something.

603
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,960
Yet at the same time,

604
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,080
you're very conscious

605
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,720
and also introspection

606
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,920
and taking the time to really reflect.

607
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,800
And I really appreciate

608
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,240
that you brought that reflection

609
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,960
into my life

610
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,880
because these are not mutually exclusive

611
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,360
racing to something

612
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,320
and being happy internally

613
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,760
and being satisfied.

614
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,360
Roy, I want to thank you

615
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,520
for being so generous with your time.

616
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,600
Before we leave, I need three words

617
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,400
that you would use to describe yourself.

618
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,360
Okay.

619
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,560
Jews, entrepreneurial,

620
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,160
Israeli and loving,

621
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,560
because I have a lot of love in me.

622
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,560
100%.

623
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,360
And I can testify from the past year

624
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,680
watching you both in the classroom

625
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,560
and also outside in the social scene,

626
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,040
it resonates.

627
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,120
I can't wait to see

628
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,480
the incredible things that you do

629
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,720
and be part of each other's journeys.

630
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,960
So, thank you very very much

631
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,480
for taking the time to be here.

632
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,470
Thank you, Michael.

633
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,610
Take care
