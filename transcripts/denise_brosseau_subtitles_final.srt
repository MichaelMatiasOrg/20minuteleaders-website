1
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,400
Denise Brosseau, thank you so much

2
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,080
for being on my show.

3
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,800
How are you?

4
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,840
I'm very well, Michael.

5
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,560
Nice to talk with you.

6
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,440
I'm so excited to hear about your journey

7
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,520
and the different organizations

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,360
that you're a part of.

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
We're not gonna be able to talk about

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,080
everything that you've done

11
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,080
even though I want to talk

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,640
about everything

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,000
because it's so, so cool.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,360
Besides the fact that you were a lecturer

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,280
at Stanford Business School

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,960
and you were honored

17
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,280
as a Champion for Change

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,080
by the White House.

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,120
And you were, I think,

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,320
named one of 100 most influential women

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,360
in Silicon Valley as well.

22
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,520
So, a lot to talk about definitely,

23
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,360
but before we dive into

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,600
two specific wonderful organizations

25
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,240
you're a part of,

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,240
Futuro Health and Vote by Design,

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,520
both related to Stanford,

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,320
I'd love to hear a little bit

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,080
about yourself.

30
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,240
And you mentioned to me

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,400
that you started your first company

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,640
at the age of 26.

33
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,960
And I'd love to understand a little bit

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,840
about your life journey and what led you

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,760
to do all the awesome things that you do.

36
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,120
By the way, one of the most awesome things

37
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,080
that I found was that you are on the board

38
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,360
of a local theatre company,

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,520
right, in the Bay Area

40
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,120
which won the Tony Award.

41
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,840
It did.

42
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,400
And it's been such a pleasure.

43
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,560
You never think

44
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,920
I've been a huge theatergoer

45
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,640
my whole life

46
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,280
and to get invited to serve on this board

47
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,360
was such a dream.

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,320
And then, literally right after I joined,

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,160
they won the Tony

50
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,840
and so sure, I'll take credit.

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,680
Are you more interested in plays

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,240
or in musicals for theater?

53
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,280
It's both, which I love.

54
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,800
It's three musicals every year

55
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,640
and four standard plays.

56
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,640
And so, it's the best

57
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,800
of all possible worlds.

58
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,880
All right. So, I have to know

59
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,880
your favorite musical?

60
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,800
Oh, my goodness.

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,480
That's not a fair question.

62
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,080
It's like choosing

63
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,800
between a mother and a father.

64
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,000
A musical you love?

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,240
I will go back to my earliest days.

66
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,520
I think the first musical

67
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
I ever fell in love with

68
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,960
was The Sound of Music.

69
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,880
And just recently, I went back

70
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,640
and watched the movie.

71
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,440
I had not seen it in decades.

72
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,680
And so, what a pleasure to realize

73
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,520
that musical really stands up over time.

74
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,280
100%. It's timeless.

75
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,600
Okay. So, going back to your journey.

76
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,880
You're starting a company

77
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,800
at the age of 26

78
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,080
and walk me through some of your path.

79
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
Well, I started my career

80
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,760
really very eclectic,

81
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,040
had no idea what I wanted to be

82
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,800
when I grew up.

83
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,880
But I moved out to California

84
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,480
after coming out here on a business trip

85
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,480
and sort of stumbled my way

86
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,240
into the tech industry.

87
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,840
And my first company went under quickly

88
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,040
after I had joined it.

89
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,680
And while I was there, I fell in love

90
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,120
with this Macintosh computer.

91
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,320
And so, I ended up going into

92
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,560
another consumer software company,

93
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,480
which I loved, but on the side,

94
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,320
I started this

95
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,120
Macintosh consulting business

96
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,000
and started helping install computers

97
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,560
and train people on computers

98
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,160
and ended up making more money

99
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,520
in my little side business

100
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,080
than I did in my day business

101
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,680w
which was fine 'cause it was really

102
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,640
where my heart was.

103
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,240
And it was actually that experience

104
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,400
that really pushed me

105
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
to go to business school,

106
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,920
to go back to Stanford and get my MBA,

107
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,960
because I was thinking

108
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,920
I love this little company,

109
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,360
but I don't know how to scale it.

110
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,400
I just had no real understanding

111
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,080
of what it took to do that next step.

112
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,120
And so, when I went back to get my MBA,

113
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,920
it was with that entrepreneurship goal,

114
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,640
but also I did a focus in non-profits.

115
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,240
And so coming out of Stanford,

116
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,360
I went back into the tech industry,

117
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,120
but on the side

118
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,360
I started a nonprofit organization

119
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,680
with a bunch of friends.

120
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,120
And it was really the culmination

121
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,160
of both of those loves,

122
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,880
which was an organization called

123
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,480
the Forum for Women Entrepreneurs,

124
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,760
a non-profit, and it was all about

125
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,920
women in venture capital.

126
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,840
How could I help others

127
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,440
who were going through

128
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,400
what I was going through to really scale.

129
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,360
How do you do that?

130
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,840
How do you raise venture capital?

131
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,880
Why would you want to?

132
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,400
Why would you not want to?

133
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,120
And then ... built this community

134
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,040
and grew it to seven cities

135
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,000
across the country.

136
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,320
And I helped start

137
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,680
the first venture capital conference

138
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,280
for women entrepreneurs, Springboard,

139
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,200
that has helped now women raise

140
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,040
over nine billion in capital.

141
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,640
So that was sort of that really joyous journey

142
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,760
of women's entrepreneurship.

143
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,320
It had its downsides; there was

144
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,560
economic downturns and struggles.

145
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,600
But then after that,

146
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,120
I did a little other eclectic things,

147
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,160
did some politics,

148
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,080
and then I started in really the journey

149
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,120
that I'm in now, which is

150
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,040
how do I help people make the journey

151
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,200
from leader to thought leader.

152
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,800
You actually taught a course, right,

153
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,760
at Stanford Business School, about that.

154
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,200
Yeah. That's really my passion right now

155
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,120
is how do I help people,

156
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,640
primarily women, but everybody,

157
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,920
really think through like what is it take

158
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,720
to be a thought leader,

159
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,400
why do you need to think about this,

160
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,840
why does this matter.

161
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,840
And so, I wrote a book on the subject.

162
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,040
I do a lot of consulting

163
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,280
and coaching and teaching

164
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,680
both at Stanford and on Lincoln Learning.

165
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,080
And that's really the work I do today.

166
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,280
So, talk to me a little bit

167
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,280
about this jump between a leader

168
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,960
and a thought leader.

169
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,240
What is that all about?

170
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,440
It's a wonderful question,

171
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,640
because I think it's been

172
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,000
such an overused word

173
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,600
and part of what I've been trying to do

174
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,960
in working in this field

175
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,480
is to recapture what I think

176
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,760
is the essential elements.

177
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,880
So, for me, leader is someone

178
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,120
who is really what I call,

179
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,840
"one to many"

180
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,720
They usually have control over the people

181
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,200
that they're interacting with,

182
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,760
that they're managing, they're leading

183
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,480
because they are in some ways

184
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,640
connected to these folks,

185
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,240
either through a direct relationship

186
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,840
or somewhat a matrix organization.

187
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,800
But when you think about

188
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,400
thought leadership, I think about

189
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,920
that as many to many;

190
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,000
how do you get people to take the ideas

191
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
that you're advocating

192
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,280
and carry them forward

193
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,120
to their communities.

194
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,040
So, it's really thinking

195
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,240
about this ripple effect

196
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,960
at how do we build change,

197
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,440
how do we build essential movements,

198
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,280
and that is really this construct

199
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,440
of being a thought leader.

200
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
So, it's a really different set of skills.

201
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,040
I mean, it's certainly

202
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,360
the essential elements of leaders,

203
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,680
but then it adds a whole set of skills,

204
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,680
of mostly communication skills,

205
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,800
about how you really move beyond that

206
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
to become a thought leader.

207
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,200
So for anybody watching this

208
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,120
that we don't have the privilege

209
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,840
of being in that class and going through

210
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,760
that journey with you,

211
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,000
give me some of the insights

212
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,280
that students taking that course

213
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,520
at Stanford would get

214
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,800
about understanding how to have this

215
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,320
one to many relationship as a leader.

216
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,160
I think it begins

217
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,360
with really understanding

218
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,720
that you can't do this in every field.

219
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,480
You have to really double down

220
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,400
and find one particular niche

221
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,480
that's really yours.

222
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,880
Someplace that you can own

223
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,920
and that you have some passion around.

224
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,000
So, it's not even just about expertise,

225
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,400
it is about having some driving passion

226
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,880
around making some change.

227
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,920
So I talk a lot about this

228
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,280
"what if" future.

229
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
So, when I was starting the Forum

230
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,040
for Women Entrepreneurs,

231
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,440
my what if future was

232
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,400
"What if women could have 50%

233
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,520
of the venture capital funding

234
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,000
in the United States?"

235
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,840
At the time, it was less than one percent

236
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,360
when we began, and sadly

237
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,760
not a whole lot has changed.

238
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,640
I think in a good year

239
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,040
we might get to four percent

240
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,880
or seven percent, maybe.

241
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,640
Really?

242
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,560
Yeah. No, it's been ...

243
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,200
We have made very little progress.

244
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,080
And so, your what if future

245
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,120
can be far, far away,

246
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,480
it can be something you're striving to.

247
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,800
But the other thing to understand,

248
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,000
I think the big differentiator

249
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,480
between leaders and thought leaders

250
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,200
is this idea of being clear

251
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,600
in developing frameworks and blueprints

252
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,360
and things that others can pick up

253
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,240
and carry forward.

254
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,440
It's not enough for you

255
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,720
to have a really cool meme

256
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,680
or just a message

257
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,240
that people can carry forward,

258
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,160
although I'm not saying that's not good,

259
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,840
that's a ... essential element,

260
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,480
but really having the guideposts

261
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,520
for others who are going

262
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,080
to carry your ideas to their communities.

263
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,720
They need to have the message, the book,

264
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,000
the blueprint in some way.

265
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,400
And so, I think that was

266
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,720
a key differentiator

267
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,160
that I was trying to teach my students.

268
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,080
Like what does it take to make change,

269
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,680
and when you've learned something,

270
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,760
how can you share that with others.

271
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,520
I love it. Okay.

272
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,440
And then you get honored

273
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,320
by the White House.

274
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,960
Was that for a specific project?

275
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,400
Did you go to the White House for that?

276
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,080
I did. It was quite an amazing experience.

277
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,040
It was under Obama,

278
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,080
which was a wonderful time

279
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,520
to be in the White House.

280
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,280
And I was honored for my work

281
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,840
with women's entrepreneurship,

282
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,040
whether it was through Springboard

283
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,200
or through the Forum for Women Entrepreneurs.

284
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,560
And I was nominated

285
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,520
and selected and we went.

286
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,040
There was a hundred people

287
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,800
who were all honored at the same time,

288
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,440
and we were honored

289
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,720
from across the United States.

290
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,080
And what was so magical about that day,

291
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,680
besides never imagined

292
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,440
you're gonna get honored

293
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,080
at the White House,

294
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,520
okay let's start with that.

295
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,160
But then, it was a whole day.

296
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,600
So after the ceremony,

297
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,880
then they actually broke us up

298
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,280
into working groups, and we had a chance

299
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,400
to sit down with people

300
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,640
from different networks of women

301
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,720
from Florida to ... Tennessee,

302
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,480
and I learned so much

303
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,760
from what these people were doing

304
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,440
and I was able to share some of the things

305
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,520
that I had also been working on.

306
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,840
And so, that was I think

307
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,760
that was the hugest gift.

308
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,200
Wow. That's incredible. Okay.

309
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,880
So, let's dive into

310
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,560
two wonderful organizations,

311
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,600
both of them making a great impact.

312
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,160
Let's start with Futuro Health

313
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,840
and then move on to Vote by Design,

314
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,080
which is obviously very, very relevant

315
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,480
to the times we live in today.

316
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,720
So, the Futuro Health,

317
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,520
talk to me a little bit about that.

318
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,320
Most recently, you were

319
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,040
the chief operating officer

320
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,240
of that organization.

321
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,000
What was the aim over there?

322
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,040
So, what was great about Futuro Health

323
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,160
is it's a very unique design

324
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,400
in the way it came together.

325
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,640
So, it was brought about by a partnership

326
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,800
between Kaiser Permanente

327
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,760
and their largest union, SEIU-UHW.

328
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,080
And these two organizations came together

329
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,040
and funded this non-profit, Futuro Health,

330
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,880
with $132,000,000

331
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,400
over the next four years.

332
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,600
And the focus is

333
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,520
how do we build the next network

334
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,560
as it were, or the next workforce

335
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,840
in education, excuse me,

336
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,520
the next workforce in health care.

337
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,040
And so what we're doing is

338
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,800
... the union is out there

339
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,040
picking up connections

340
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,600
through the community of all the members

341
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,040
that they have,

342
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,160
they've 100,000 members.

343
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,280
So, they're outreaching

344
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,000
to friends and family and inviting them

345
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,400
to come and go back to school

346
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,840
to become health care workers.

347
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,000
And then Kaiser's money is then spent

348
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,280
to actually support these adult learners

349
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,240
to go back to become medical assistants,

350
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,960
dental assistants, etc.

351
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
Because in California, we are looking

352
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
at a shortage, even before covid.

353
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,560
It was looking to be

354
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,280
500,000 person shortage

355
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,840
in health care by 2025.

356
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,480
What?

357
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,320
I know. And that kind of scared me

358
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,040
because I want to grow old here, right.

359
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,280
I want someone to be ready

360
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,920
to take care of me when I'm older.

361
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,360
So this is really,

362
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,750
and what's unique about it

363
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,640
not just, of course,

364
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,000
... such an enormous initiative,

365
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,800
but it's so unusual

366
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,200
for a big organization and a union

367
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,560
to come together. That is very rare.

368
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,160
But secondly, understanding that

369
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,920
it is very hard for an individual,

370
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,880
especially a low income individual,

371
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,120
to go back to school.

372
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,680
It's a year out of your life,

373
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,280
it's expensive.

374
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,200
To have an organization who not only

375
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
is gonna pay for it,

376
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,800
but also gonna offer you support

377
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,880
through that journey,

378
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,800
that's the really critical element

379
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,440
because we really want

380
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,600
to build our workforce,

381
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,080
but we can't depend on them

382
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,760
to be able to pay

383
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,200
for their own education.

384
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,280
We need to fund them.

385
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,480
And so this, I think, is a model

386
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,920
that we'd love to see replicated

387
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,120
across the whole United States.

388
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,280
Wow. So, give me a little bit of insight

389
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,200
into the actual experience

390
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,880
of being the operating officer over there.

391
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,040
What were some of the greatest challenges

392
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,960
you faced and some of the

393
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,800
interesting occurrences you had?

394
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,120
Well, the fun thing was

395
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,040
I was working with a woman

396
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,400
that I actually knew

397
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,520
through the Stanford community.

398
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,280
She's also a Stanford MBA.

399
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,600
She's a couple of years behind me,

400
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,120
and she also has her masters

401
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
in education.

402
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,800
And she was actually

403
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,160
headhunted by this group

404
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,680
to start and to be the CEO.

405
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,360
And she called me

406
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,080
I was the first person

407
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,520
that she brought on board week one

408
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,960
and we got together.

409
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,080
I was really the person

410
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,320
putting in all the infrastructure.

411
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
So, while she was doing a lot of managing

412
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,560
of the unbelievable amount of politics

413
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,280
that were involved,

414
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,080
I was really putting in all the

415
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,240
getting the bank account,

416
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,600
figuring out who was going to do

417
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
the accounting for us, all of that.

418
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,520
And then hiring the team

419
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,920
and finding a location up in Sacramento

420
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,120
where we were all located.

421
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,680
And then, of course, all the basics

422
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,400
of putting in the financials,

423
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,960
putting in all of the systems and processes.

424
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,480
So, I learned a ton.

425
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,000
I hadn't actually been an employee

426
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,680
for a long time, so ...

427
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,080
I'm almost always a consultant.

428
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
So, this was kind of unique for me,

429
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,400
but I really believe

430
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,880
in the mission of the organization

431
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,560
and I just love everything

432
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,160
that we were doing.

433
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,200
So, I did a whole year of commitment

434
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,880
to this, and I just left

435
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,600
about two weeks ago.

436
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,160
So, I'm really proud of what the organization,

437
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,040
is on its solid footing now,

438
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,880
and I ... feel like they're on their way,

439
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,280
and I really love that startup phase.

440
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,320
I'm not the person

441
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,880
who likes to be there to scale.

442
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,720
I really like the foundations

443
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,320
and getting everything done.

444
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,440
Unbelievable.

445
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,360
Okay. And then you work on

446
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,840
Vote by Design, working with

447
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,120
the design school at Stanford,

448
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,880
which is notorious for coming up

449
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,200
with innovative solutions

450
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,520
to all sorts of problems.

451
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,400
So, what is this project?

452
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
So Lisa Kay Solomon, my client,

453
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,880
is the founder of Vote by Design.

454
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,920
And she came together,

455
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,200
she's an entrepreneur in residence, executive in residence

456
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,480
over at the Design school.

457
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,880
And she brought together a group of folks,

458
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,000
whether they were design thinking folks,

459
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,840
neuro-scientists, educators,

460
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,160
they came together about a year ago

461
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,320
to rethink how individuals

462
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,760
can be empowered

463
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,200
to have more agency around voting.

464
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,080
How could you create

465
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,080
a civic engagement experience

466
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,960
for voters and would be voters

467
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,160
to understand what it means

468
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,600
to select a president?

469
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,800
So, just to give context into this problem

470
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,360
because there are a lot of people

471
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,920
that are watching this

472
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,200
that are outside of the United States.

473
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,480
What is the pain point that this program

474
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,920
is trying to solve?

475
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,200
Because any person would imagine

476
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,480
yes, there's an election.

477
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,800
Every person wants to vote

478
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,040
because we all want to select

479
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,320
our next leader, right?

480
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,280
But that's not exactly the case.

481
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,840
Well, that is one issue.

482
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,600
One is that people

483
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,720
don't always choose to go and vote.

484
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,000
They feel that their vote doesn't matter,

485
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,600
or they don't really have

486
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,520
the wherewithal

487
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,960
to understand what does it mean

488
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,880
to choose a leader of a country.

489
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,400
I mean most of us, we just,

490
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,920
we come out of high school,

491
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,760
we come out of college,

492
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,800
whatever, we go vote.

493
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,920
Nobody ever taught us

494
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,840
anything more than

495
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,200
okay, this is the day,

496
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,080
this is the place,

497
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,320
this is what you go do.

498
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,600
But the actual understanding

499
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,240
of how you select a candidate,

500
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,680
it's very easy, I think,

501
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,240
for all of us to be a bit lazy.

502
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,320
Like I'm a Democrat,

503
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,040
I'm just gonna vote

504
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,120
the Democratic ticket

505
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,880
or I'm a Republican.

506
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,720
But personally, as an independent,

507
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,240
I find I can't really do that.

508
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,520
I need to be more thoughtful.

509
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,560
But what ... pushing people to do

510
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,280
is to be more thoughtful

511
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,160
by creating a one to two hour

512
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,120
engaged experience, non-partisan,

513
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,800
non-issue specific, but very much

514
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,000
a fun interactive process for thinking

515
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
about what are you looking for

516
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,120
in a candidate. Like what are

517
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,040
the leadership characteristics

518
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,840
that it takes to be a president?

519
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,720
Ahat does it take

520
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,840
to be a president in a crisis?

521
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,560
What did it take for our past presidents,

522
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,320
like which ones do you think

523
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,680
of as successful and why?

524
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,920
And then really take all of that

525
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,640
and wrap it into a new way

526
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,920
of understanding how you might select

527
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,640
in the next election,

528
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,920
how you might watch

529
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,720
a debate differently.

530
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,840
Like I was watching

531
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,600
the campaign last night,

532
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,200
the fourth day of the convention

533
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,000
for the Democrats,

534
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,960
and it's just so interesting how leaders

535
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,160
are, introduce themselves.

536
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,720
But if you don't have that lens,

537
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,960
if you're not looking at that,

538
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,600
you're just looking for the slogans

539
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,360
or the rah rah,

540
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,480
you may forget that this is

541
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,840
selecting the leader, as we call it,

542
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,280
of the free world, right,

543
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,600
of the United States.

544
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,360
And that is an awesome responsibility

545
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,320
that we want to ...
- Of course.

546
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,400
So, it sounds like the solution

547
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,160
that is proposed here

548
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,880
it's less of about trying

549
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,000
to actively going and telling people,

550
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,240
"You should go vote. This is important."

551
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,920
But get them to actively think

552
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,880
intrinsically what matters to them

553
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,320
in a leader, and then by having them

554
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,480
be more thoughtful about it

555
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,600
and be more caring about it,

556
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,560
that will create the agency for them

557
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,400
to go and take action

558
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,680
and hopefully propel this

559
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,200
within their own community, right?

560
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,600
I couldn't have said it better myself.

561
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,120
Wonderful. So, how has this been going?

562
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,680
Is this something that's being active

563
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,040
right now as we're nearing the election?

564
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,360
What's been wonderful about it

565
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,000
is that we're being able

566
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,040
to get this spread across schools,

567
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,320
across libraries,

568
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,760
across community centers,

569
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,560
so that we've created these tools

570
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,480
freely available on the website,

571
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,800
www.votebydesign.org,

572
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,920
and we're giving them away

573
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,120
to anyone and everyone

574
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,920
including a facilitator guide,

575
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,240
all the materials you need

576
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,840
so that you can run these sessions.

577
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,480
And so we're encouraging people,

578
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,920
as many as possible

579
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,720
in high schools and above,

580
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,320
to run sessions like this.

581
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,560
And what we are finding is that

582
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,160
teachers love this,

583
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,760
community leaders love this

584
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,360
because it's all done for you.

585
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,720
You can learn how to facilitate this

586
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,800
in an hour. The session can be anywhere.

587
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,160
Yeah. Very easy to facilitate.

588
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,960
I participated

589
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,200
in one of the first sessions

590
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,640
and just fell in love with the whole idea

591
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,520
because I thought it was so clever.

592
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,040
And even at my age,

593
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,560
having voted for many years,

594
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,480
what was wonderful

595
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,320
was to have a new lens provided for me

596
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,840
as I make these decisions.

597
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,800
I honestly had never really thought

598
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,080
about how I choose a president.

599
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,120
I'd never really thought about

600
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,200
... more important this versus that.

601
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,360
So, I think that

602
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,280
these kinds of conversations

603
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,560
and this kind of engaged perspective

604
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,400
is what we need

605
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,680
to have a citizenship with agency

606
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,960
as you said.

607
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,840
I love it. And I love the scalability

608
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,320
because my next question was going to be

609
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,520
it's great to have these sessions,

610
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,440
but it seems that

611
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,120
it's not really scalable.

612
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,240
Bringing people together in a room,

613
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,440
teaching a moderator,

614
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,600
having a personal interaction

615
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,360
with the participants,

616
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,320
but if you're able to make this

617
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,360
as simple as an hour for somebody

618
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,200
to become a good facilitator

619
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,600
and then taking it to their own community

620
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,280
and create agency within them,

621
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,560
then obviously the butterfly effect

622
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,480
just continues from there.

623
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,400
That is so, so cool.

624
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,480
Denise, we only have

625
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,280
a couple of minutes left,

626
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
but I have to know

627
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,400
a little bit more about you

628
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,640
and what you're truly passionate about.

629
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,200
Because we're talking about

630
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,320
the future of health care,

631
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,360
running organizations.

632
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,040
We're talking about empowering women

633
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,000
and leadership position

634
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,760
and venture capital.

635
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
And now we're talking about politics

636
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,520
and giving agency to citizens,

637
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,800
especially young people.

638
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,120
What are you really passionate about?

639
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,040
What really motivates you?

640
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,000
My motivation is changing the world.

641
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,120
It's just as simple as that.

642
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,360
I want to make a difference.

643
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
I want to leave a legacy that matters,

644
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,720
and I think what's wonderful

645
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,320
about the organizations I've started is

646
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,840
they're all still in existence,

647
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,68
they're all still going strong,

648
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,080
and that's what it means

649
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,040
to be a startup person.

650
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,680
If you do it well, you put in the bases

651
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,920
that are going to allow others

652
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,080
to build on top of them,

653
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,400
and that's what I've been doing

654
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,760
my whole career.

655
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,560
So, what are some things

656
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,480
that I can take with me

657
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,320
as I go on my entrepreneurial journey?

658
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,680
So, I'm pretty much at the point

659
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,600
where you were at

660
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,840
when you started your first company,

661
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,880
and now I get to take

662
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,080
some of your insights and go with them.

663
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,680
So, what things

664
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,520
should I be keeping in mind

665
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,480
as I go on my journey

666
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,160
to hopefully make a positive impact

667
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,200
on the world?

668
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,160
Well, I will say

669
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,800
the most important thing I've learned,

670
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,640
if I only had one, it would be

671
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,240
don't build a company because it's cool

672
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,560
or it's the fun thing to do;

673
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,160
only build organizations and companies

674
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,960
where people already are asking

675
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,480
for what you are building.

676
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,360
So every time I've been successful,

677
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,800
it's because there was a need

678
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
and it was expressed.

679
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,120
In fact, I was usually doing

680
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,640
whatever it was for free

681
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,440
before anybody ever paid me,

682
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,720
because people kept calling

683
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,000
and needing that service

684
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,840
or that whatever I was trying

685
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,760
to put out in the world, that product.

686
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,080
And so, the time that I did not do that,

687
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,720
when I just thought it was a cool idea

688
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,120
and I'm just gonna go build it,

689
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,320
nothing happened, right.

690
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,400
But when I build something

691
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,200
people already are asking for

692
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,640
So I say to listen.

693
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,200
If you listen to the marketplace,

694
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,760
it tells you what is needed

695
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,720
and where the money lay

696
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,840
and where the audiences lay

697
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,760
and that you can just go pick those up

698
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,200
and go forward.

699
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,560
That's the best way to build a company.

700
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,760
Denise, thank you for being so generous

701
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,200
with your time.

702
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,840
This was wonderful.

703
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,960
I have one last question

704
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,320
and that is three words that you would use

705
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,240
to describe yourself.

706
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:43,880
Well, I would say

707
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,240
anybody who knows me would say

708
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,720
the most important thing to know is that

709
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,360
I'm very well connected

710
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,880
and I think that's part and parcel

711
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,040
of the life that I've built.

712
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,200
It's very connected

713
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,000
in many different communities.

714
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,800
I'd say the second,

715
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,040
which you've already picked up on, is

716
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,960
I'm very eclectic,

717
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,680
like I don't have just one thing

718
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,960
I'm interested in.

719
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,320
And then third, I'm really passionate

720
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,720
and energized about making change.

721
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,200
I love it.

722
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,720
Denise, thank you very, very much.

723
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,040
Continue doing good for the world,

724
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,640
and I look forward

725
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,680
to following your journey

726
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,640
and hopefully reconnecting along the way

727
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,560
and continue to ask

728
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,800
for advice and support.

729
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,200
So, thank you very, very much.

730
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,960
You're welcome, Michael.

731
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,320
It was great to talk with you.

732
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:27,880
You too.
