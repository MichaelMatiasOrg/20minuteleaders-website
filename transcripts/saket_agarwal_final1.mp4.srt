00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,639
Five years ago,

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,839
we had five unicorns based out of India.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,839
Now, we have about 24,

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,239
and we expect

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,759
there'll be another 50 unicorns

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,050
in the next five years.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,119
Saket Agarwal,

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,359
thank you so much for joining me.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,840
How are you?

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,639
I'm awesome.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,519
How are you?

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,119
Fantastic.

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,759
Are you calling from India right now?

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,319
Yes, yes.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,519
I'm based out of Mumbai.

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,639
So, you're based out of Mumbai,

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,599
yet your hashtag

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,479
is "Your Israel tech guy" right?

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,275
Yes, yes. Your Israel guy.

20
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:55,599
I'm in Israel.

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,039
So, this is going to be a lot of fun

22
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,679
because I'm going to be learning

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,759
so much from this call.

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,759
Besides for the fact

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,599
that you're an accountant

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,799
and you're the co ambassador

27
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,879
of the Singularity University chapter

28
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,741
of Mumbai,

29
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,239
you are extremely passionate

30
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,199
about the intersection

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,639
of Israel and in India tech ecosystems.

32
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,800
So, this is a world

33
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,960
where I know very little about,

34
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,880
and I know very little about

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,280
the India tech ecosystem.

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,840
And that's why I'm so excited

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,600
to hear your insights

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,720
and what's happening today.

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,840
But before we get into all that,

40
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,160
who are you

41
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,480
and what is your journey

42
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,880
into this tech world?

43
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:33,119
Yeah, thanks, thanks

44
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,039
for having me on the show.

45
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm really excited.

46
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,280
So, I started on aviation

47
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:39,839
about five years ago.

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,520
I'm an accountant by qualification.

49
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,880
And the thesis is that

50
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,000
every time I went to the US,

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,680
I would eat at Chipotle

52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,440
or I would sit on a Tesla,

53
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,160
and then I would wonder

54
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,120
why aren't these companies

55
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,600
coming to India.

56
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,720
And the natural realization was

57
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,640
they would ideally go to the US first

58
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,040
because US is the media market to crack.

59
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,400
And one fine day I went to Israel

60
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,280
and I saw that

61
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,680
so many disruptive technologies

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
also going to the US,

63
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,440
not looking in India.

64
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,040
But Israelis loved Indians

65
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,800
because you guys come to India.

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,360
After the army.

67
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,360
So I thought,

68
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,240
why not explore this corridor

69
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,760
where I identify the most disruptive

70
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,960
Israeli SaaS companies,

71
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,120
identify their market for India,

72
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,800
hire a team,

73
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:33,520
and run their entire business.

74
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,840
So, I went for a 17 day trip to Israel.

75
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,639
Literally met a hundred companies,

76
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,239
so many people.

77
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,960
And towards the end I got lucky.

78
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,960
I met a company called, Spot.io.

79
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,200
Yes.

80
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Which was recently acquired by NetApp

81
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,520
for $450,000,000.

82
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,239
So, Spot essentially

83
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,160
helps you optimize your AWS costs

84
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,080
by 80%.

85
00:02:59,081 --> 00:03:00,879
Being an accountant,

86
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,879
it just resonated with me.

87
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,240
And

88
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,120
I was like,

89
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,480
okay, why not explore this.

90
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,760
So, I got them to India,

91
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,000
hired a bunch of folks

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,685
to review a decent chunk

93
00:03:13,885 --> 00:03:15,440
of the revenue for Spot.

94
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,080
Almost all the big e-commerce,

95
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,560
media and gaming companies,

96
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,240
everyone's a customer.

97
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:25,119
And then we realized,

98
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,159
since we have more hundred customers

99
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,800
using Spot,

100
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,080
how do we sell them everything else?

101
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,400
So, over a period of time,

102
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,760
we've got a portfolio

103
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,000
of 15 Israeli companies.

104
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,280
We run their India business.

105
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,800
We've hired

106
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,720
professional sales folks for them

107
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,880
and we're like their extended arm.

108
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:46,719
So, first of all, it's amazing.

109
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,440
And I think that on one hand,

110
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,600
you're doing a great service

111
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,760
to Israeli tech companies.

112
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,200
On the other hand,

113
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,160
you're doing a great service

114
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,920
to the companies in India

115
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,920
by bridging this gap.

116
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,440
Because obviously,

117
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,760
it's a huge win-win.

118
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,360
Let's go back to the problem.

119
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,720
Why do Israelis and Americans

120
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:04,239
not look at their business

121
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,400
to the Indian market?

122
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,520
We're talking about

123
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,280
more than a billion people.

124
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,640
We're talking about potentially,

125
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,920
and the glass ceiling is so high

126
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,760
you can't even see it

127
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,480
in terms of the potential business.

128
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,640
To me, it makes perfect sense

129
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,480
when I build a business,

130
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,560
I want to also go to the India market.

131
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,680
Why is it so hard

132
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,640
or people don't do it?

133
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:26,840
Yeah.

134
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,920
So, the natural answer is,

135
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,120
US is a comfort zone

136
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,160
for every Israeli, right?

137
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,920
You've been there,

138
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,480
you've stayed there,

139
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,560
you have so many family,

140
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,120
and you have so many friends

141
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,240
and family members running

142
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,880
big corporations in the US ecosystem.

143
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,000
So, it's always easier

144
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:43,959
to tap into the US

145
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,239
because you are aware.

146
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,439
India, on the other hand,

147
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,879
is a slightly unknown territory.

148
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
So, you need a lot of guidance

149
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,160
in order to find a greater market.

150
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,760
The second thing is,

151
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,960
India has a large population,

152
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,000
not necessarily a large market

153
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,800
for every product, unlike the US.

154
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,760
So, what do you want to bring into India

155
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,080
has to be very, very well thought to.

156
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,680
Does it for the Indian market

157
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,760
well or not;

158
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,160
will you be able to make

159
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,320
a big business out of it or not,

160
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,040
is a key question.

161
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,800
So,

162
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,600
if you are able to scale

163
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,200
a hundred companies in the US,

164
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,120
the same number would reduce to 10

165
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,880
if you would bring those companies

166
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,760
into India if you want to see scale.

167
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,160
Interesting.

168
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,760
Right?

169
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,000
So, that is one of the media reasons

170
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
when a company

171
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,480
is looking at their options,

172
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,040
where do they want

173
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,520
to expand first.

174
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,720
They naturally do it in the US

175
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,600
than in India.

176
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:38,319
So, can you give me

177
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,160
a little bit of background

178
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,160
into the Indian market.

179
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,800
What is the tech ecosystem like?

180
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,239
Who are the customers?

181
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,480
And then what I love to talk about is,

182
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,760
maybe understanding a little bit

183
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:54,319
the different cultural habits

184
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,679
that maybe hinder

185
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,079
the relationships to scale

186
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,960
from 10 to 100 companies.

187
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,759
Yeah, yeah.

188
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,440
So, in terms of the

189
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,200
Indian tech landscape,

190
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,360
I'll give you some context.

191
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,680
Five years ago we had

192
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,480
five unicorns based out of India.

193
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,640
Now, we have about 24,

194
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,480
and we expect there'll be another

195
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,520
50 unicorns in the next five years.

196
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,800
So, just to repeat that.

197
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,040
So, five years ago,

198
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,440
you had five unicorns.

199
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,240
That's about the number that Israel had,

200
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,720
I guess maybe

201
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,480
five, 10 years ago, right, as well.

202
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:38,640
And now, you have 24.

203
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,479
And you're expecting to double that

204
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,880
in the next five years.

205
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,679
Correct. More than double.

206
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,560
We expect about a hundred unicorns.

207
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,640
So, a couple of things,

208
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,720
the digital landscape

209
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,920
is really exploding in India right now.

210
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,480
So, we've seen like a 100x growth

211
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,480
in terms of start up

212
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,920
Internet penetration since 2010.

213
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,200
All the venture capital funds are now

214
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,920
prioritizing India in a big way.

215
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,840
To give you context,

216
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:11,519
Sequoia Capital recently raised

217
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,280
a big funding round

218
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,600
of $1.35 billion,

219
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,080
only and only

220
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:18,679
to invest in Indian tech startups.

221
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,920
Right?

222
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,919
So, suddenly, there's a massive push

223
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,719
towards digital adoption,

224
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,440
digital transformation.

225
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:29,359
So, the payment infrastructure

226
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,320
that India has

227
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,120
is actually the most advanced

228
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,160
across the world.

229
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,840
So, if I were to transfer you money

230
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,480
sitting in India,

231
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,160
I can do it under 30 seconds

232
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,040
using a unique UPI ID,

233
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,920
which is linked to your mobile phone.

234
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,120
Right.

235
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,880
Or if I have to access a doctor,

236
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,040
there are several apps that are available

237
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,680
that can help me do video consultation

238
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,600
or order online medicines right away.

239
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,360
We can get food delivery in 30 minutes

240
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:03,359
in such a massive country.

241
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,840
Like Mumbai itself is maybe 10x

242
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,680
the population of Israelis,

243
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,640
but we've been able to handle that scale

244
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:12,759
in a very digital friendly way,

245
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,760
very, very successfully.

246
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,040
I think that one of the things that

247
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,240
I am underestimating

248
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:20,399
and I'm guessing that a lot of people

249
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,039
in my community

250
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,080
are underestimating is that,

251
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,560
having 30-minute food deliveries

252
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,560
or a 30-second payment system

253
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
in a place like Mumbai,

254
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,960
which is 10x Israel,

255
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,400
that expansion,

256
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,680
it makes perfect sense

257
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,080
why you may take a little bit longer,

258
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,640
but when it gets there,

259
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,640
it has to be so much more robust

260
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,280
and foundational

261
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,120
to be able to handle that scale, right?

262
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,960
I mean, we're talking about

263
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,840
a massively different problem.

264
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,920
And I think that one of the things

265
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,240
that I'm understanding and I'm really,

266
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,320
when you're talking about this 10x growth

267
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,840
and the hundred unicorns

268
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,640
in the next few years,

269
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,120
I'm surprised that I'm not seeing

270
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,600
every headline talk about

271
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,400
the amazing things

272
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,840
that are coming out of India.

273
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,680
Because in my news feed

274
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,040
that is tailored for me,

275
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
I'm seeing the tech ecosystem in Israel,

276
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,760
the tech ecosystem in Palo Alto,

277
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,680
in Seattle, in New York.

278
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:14,959
But I'm missing out on what sounds like

279
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,920
the really the next huge market

280
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,600
that is going to be

281
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,880
the tech innovator of the world.

282
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,159
Absolutely. Absolutely.

283
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,600
So, one thing I want to highlight is

284
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,520
our strength in India has been B2C,

285
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,600
wherein the Israel has been very strong

286
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,360
on the B2B side.

287
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,760
I miss I think, something last IPL.

288
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,640
IPL is Indian Premier League.

289
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,600
It's one of the biggest

290
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,560
cricketing tournaments in India.

291
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,120
The final match had 25,000,000

292
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,160
concurrent users.

293
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,400
So, 25,000,000 people

294
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,680
were watching the finals of that match

295
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,360
at a single point, right,

296
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,160
which is a global record.

297
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,160
A global record.

298
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,640
It's more than the Oscars,

299
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,480
the Super Bowl,

300
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:04,960
the [--].

301
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,600
I think so.

302
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,680
I think so.

303
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,240
I think so.

304
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,880
So, we are seeing a lot of scale

305
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,640
and that's where

306
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,880
we're saying

307
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,360
will solve a problem

308
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,080
for every individual,

309
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,840
a billion and a half people in India.

310
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,520
Where we sort of need a lot of help

311
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,640
is depth on the technology front,

312
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,760
which is where Israel comes into play.

313
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,960
You have the best data scientist,

314
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,360
the best cybersecurity professionals

315
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,400
and the best marketing

316
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:39,519
ad-tech professionals.

317
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,920
The industry is very strong there.

318
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,399
These companies are scaling so fast.

319
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,319
To give you context,

320
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,519
the largest fantasy sports

321
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,279
platform in India

322
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,039
is a company called, Dream11,

323
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,880
which is now valued

324
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,920
at $2.5 billion.

325
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,680
The mass, the media grew this all

326
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,480
was in the last two years.

327
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,240
Now, the fact that

328
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,960
they're scaling so fast,

329
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,400
they need the best of data science,

330
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,240
best of security,

331
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,080
best of QA,

332
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,920
the best of cloud infrastructure

333
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,520
and monitoring solutions.

334
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,960
And that's where they look at Israel,

335
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,360
which is really, really strong

336
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,040
in these areas.

337
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,120
And that's where I see a big synergy

338
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,360
between the two countries.

339
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,840
So, I'm just trying to synthesize

340
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,560
for myself.

341
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,040
It sounds like

342
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,880
what you're saying is that

343
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,680
there has been a great shift

344
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,679
in the market in the past few years

345
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,160
that tech companies are emerging

346
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,000
to provide local solutions to

347
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,200
one of the biggest places in the world.

348
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,560
So, these are solutions

349
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,600
that we've seen already

350
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,440
in the Western world

351
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,400
five, 10 years ago.

352
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:38,399
They are now being brought

353
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,679
into the Indian culture

354
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,320
by Indian tech companies.

355
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,800
And now there is this weird limbo zone

356
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,480
where you still

357
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,600
have an opportunity

358
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,200
to implement the great technologies

359
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,160
from Israel

360
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,360
at the scale of India.

361
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,600
And there is a win-win.

362
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,120
And what's missing there right now

363
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,440
is more people like you

364
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,320
that are making that connection, right?

365
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,320
Absolutely.

366
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,400
Absolutely.

367
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,360
What is even more interesting is

368
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,440
a few Israeli companies

369
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,080
were initially very excited

370
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,360
about the scale that they would get

371
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:11,479
in the US.

372
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,319
They are now surprised

373
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,000
by the scale they see in India.

374
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,840
You know, 25,000,000

375
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,640
concurrent users is Android

376
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,560
and which is also helping

377
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,520
the Israeli companies

378
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,680
prepare their product

379
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,680
for a much, much more higher scale.

380
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,560
All these Indian companies

381
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,440
become design partners

382
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:32,399
for such startups in Israel.

383
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:32,599
Right.

384
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,159
Now, do you have

385
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,239
any connection to Israel?

386
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,160
Why are you so excited about

387
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,840
making this bridge?

388
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,840
What got you into this?

389
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,639
Yeah. Look,

390
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,599
I just landed in Israel,

391
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,239
I met a few people,

392
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,480
and the love and warmth

393
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,480
I got from everyone was incredible.

394
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,360
And I just got started with one company

395
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,480
and then it just kept on building.

396
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,440
I had no real,

397
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,160
you know, I'm not even a techie

398
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,800
so, for me, cloud was cloud.

399
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,320
So, the journey has purely been

400
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,400
very, very random.

401
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,760
I picked a country I knew nothing about.

402
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,080
I did one thing, it became successful.

403
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,080
And I said, why not build up on it.

404
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,280
And because Israel

405
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,040
is such a strong brand, right?

406
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,880
When I say

407
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,520
I bring US companies into India

408
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,040
or European companies into India,

409
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,399
there are too many people doing it.

410
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:31,920
With Israel,

411
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,080
I was able to build a very strong niche

412
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,280
and now I am truly like,

413
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,120
one of the leading guys

414
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,040
in the tech ecosystem

415
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,600
bridging the gap.

416
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,200
Wow.

417
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,720
And so, what is your method?

418
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,520
How do you go about

419
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,320
finding the synergy?

420
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,440
Because it sounds like

421
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,080
you have to have

422
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,680
both feet in both places.

423
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,360
You have to know

424
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,320
what are the new emerging technologies

425
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,120
in Israel,

426
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,720
and what are the emerging markets

427
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,960
and who are the key players

428
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,840
that you can now

429
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:00,799
knock on their door and say,

430
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,559
hey, you now have the need

431
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,359
to supply something

432
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,799
to 20,000,000 people,

433
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,639
here is a technology

434
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,800
that might be able to assist you?

435
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,400
Yeah. Yeah.

436
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,120
That's a great question, actually.

437
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,080
So, first of all,

438
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,720
I personally visit Israel

439
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,440
every other month.

440
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:17,960
Wow.

441
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:18,279
Yeah.

442
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,199
I've built relationships with almost

443
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,840
all the big venture capital funds,

444
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,400
all the accelerators in Israel.

445
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,640
All of them are familiar

446
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,240
with our work in India.

447
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,640
The kind of success we've generated,

448
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,800
and you know how Israelis

449
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:34,879
want to generate success

450
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,680
for one company.

451
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,000
What we did with Spot, for example,

452
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,280
it became very, very popular.

453
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,080
So, the moment that a great company

454
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,000
that is born, they are saying,

455
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,600
okay, you are looking at the US market,

456
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,520
why don't you also look

457
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,240
at India as a market.

458
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,400
So, I can give you a data point.

459
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,640
There are three companies

460
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,960
that we represent in India today.

461
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,839
All of them have raised upwards

462
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,040
of $40,000,000 in funding each

463
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,120
and we do 20% of their global revenue.

464
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,360
Wow.

465
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,520
Right.

466
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,840
Because of this good word,

467
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,600
VCs started connecting us

468
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,120
to a company

469
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,840
the moment they invest in them.

470
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,240
The third thing that I started doing

471
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,920
was I personally started

472
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,320
investing in these companies.

473
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,320
So, I've invested in

474
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:21,039
two venture capital funds

475
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,120
as an LP in Israel.

476
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,960
That gives me access

477
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,320
to the best deal flows.

478
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,200
The moment the startup is born

479
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,560
I have access to them.

480
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,840
And I recently invested

481
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,680
in a company called Dataloop,

482
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,320
which was backed by a few NDB.

483
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,880
I know him well. Eran.

484
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
Yeah.

485
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,600
Yes.

486
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,520
It's a great company.

487
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:43,439
And what we're doing is,

488
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,000
we're saying,

489
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,360
not only will help you sell,

490
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,840
but since we're running sales for you,

491
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,040
we have so much value.

492
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,480
Give us some allocation

493
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,600
to co-invest with big VCs.

494
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,440
And lastly, I would say,

495
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,320
since we have one hundred plus customers

496
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,240
and all our customers are the largest

497
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,080
e-commerce, media and gaming companies,

498
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,680
unicorns,

499
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,880
they keep sharing with us.

500
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,600
You know, personalization

501
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,160
is a big problem,

502
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,400
warehouse automation is a big problem.

503
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,520
Customer acquisition cost

504
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,320
for gaming company

505
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,400
are a huge issue.

506
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,560
Are there solutions in Israel

507
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,320
that are solving it?

508
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,000
Some of them even come to Israel with us

509
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,760
and we make them meet

510
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,240
different companies.

511
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,000
So, that's how we get

512
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,240
a lot of problem statement.

513
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,120
And then I would go to a VC and ask them,

514
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,400
you know, is there someone in Israel

515
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,000
solving this?

516
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,480
And someone in Israel is always solving

517
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,280
some problem on the other for sure.

518
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,840
And I could assume very well

519
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,240
that if you come with an actual problem

520
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,760
that somebody needs a solution for,

521
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,480
even if there is not a solution now,

522
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,240
there will be somebody

523
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,800
who is willing to pick up the glove

524
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,120
and to do the right thing.

525
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,240
Correct. Correct.

526
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,280
So, I love thinking ahead

527
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,080
and imagining what type of world

528
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,320
we're going to be living in.

529
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,640
Obviously this past year

530
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,000
has been very monumental for me

531
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,120
and thinking about

532
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,160
what are the different things

533
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,120
that are going to change,

534
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,040
and how do I need to adapt

535
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,400
as an entrepreneur and as an engineer

536
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
to this changing world due to covid.

537
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,000
But I'm curious now about

538
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,200
the Indian tech ecosystem

539
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,520
and Israelis tech ecosystem.

540
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,960
If you're looking five,

541
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,560
10 years down the line,

542
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,880
what changes, what shifts

543
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,360
are we going to see perhaps also,

544
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,440
with the US market

545
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,800
in this whole triangle?

546
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:27,119
What big developments can I look for

547
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,319
as I'm now venturing

548
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,160
into my own journey?

549
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,960
Yeah.

550
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,039
A couple of very interesting thoughts.

551
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,999
One, I feel your digital online identity

552
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,320
and how you present yourself digitally

553
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:47,760
would become so much more important than

554
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,759
anything else.

555
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,960
Right?

556
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,293
Because, you know,

557
00:17:52,493 --> 00:17:54,231
now we are in a situation

558
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,418
we  don't know when the vaccine

559
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:56,731
is actually going to come

560
00:17:56,931 --> 00:17:57,611
and when the world

561
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,919
will  start seeing each other,

562
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,236
when travel will open.

563
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:02,919
So, that window

564
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,640
all the networking

565
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,520
that we used to do at conferences,

566
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,919
meet and greet things,

567
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,999
everything's moving online.

568
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,706
So, you got to be very, very good

569
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:11,985
at how you communicate,

570
00:18:12,185 --> 00:18:12,817
how you think,

571
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:15,319
and how you position yourself digitally.

572
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,680
So that's going to be a big, big shift

573
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,079
going forward.

574
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,345
Then a lot of shift

575
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:25,996
that we will also see

576
00:18:26,196 --> 00:18:29,839
in the way people use essential services.

577
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,839
So, for example, health care, food

578
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,479
or any services that we are using

579
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,640
on a day to day basis,

580
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,879
a lot of that is going to move digital.

581
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,669
Instead of going

582
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:44,279
to a physical diagnostic center,

583
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,799
can you do everything at home.

584
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,839
So, I'm seeing a massive shift there.

585
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,519
And that's where,

586
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,575
you know, the fact that India

587
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,110
has a massive consumer base

588
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,788
and Israel

589
00:18:52,988 --> 00:18:54,319
is building these technologies.

590
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,519
I think there's a lot of synergy

591
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,399
that I see on that front as well.

592
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,004
I think that

593
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,039
all of that sounds incredibly exciting.

594
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,559
I have to say that

595
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,559
I can't believe that I know so little

596
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,990
about this emerging market,

597
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,536
because it's obviously

598
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:10,759
this is the future.

599
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,960
And I think that any entrepreneur

600
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,919
needs to understand

601
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,393
what are the emerging markets

602
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:16,199
that are possible.

603
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,475
And I'm extremely excited

604
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:19,483
to continue this conversation also

605
00:19:19,683 --> 00:19:20,927
in a professional setting

606
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,161
with whatever companies

607
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,426
I'll be building and working together

608
00:19:24,626 --> 00:19:25,604
on finding the synergy

609
00:19:25,804 --> 00:19:27,162
and the solutions to both markets.

610
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:28,305
Because it just sounds like

611
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,816
this is where we're headed

612
00:19:30,016 --> 00:19:31,762
and you can either be a part of it

613
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,847
or you can ignore it and lose.

614
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,479
You lose out on something

615
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,503
so meaningful.

616
00:19:36,703 --> 00:19:37,929
With this, I really want to thank you

617
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:39,300
for being so generous with your time

618
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,839
and all the incredible insights

619
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,439
and knowledge that you've shared.

620
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,119
But before we leave,

621
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,559
I have to ask you for three words

622
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,280
that you would use to describe yourself.

623
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,519
Your Israel guy.

624
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,279
If you are on Twitter,

625
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,453
please follow me

626
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:52,328
and spread the good word

627
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:54,047
of the work we're doing

628
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:55,305
between India-Israel.

629
00:19:55,505 --> 00:19:57,338
I think it's great opportunity

630
00:19:57,538 --> 00:19:59,064
for everyone to tap into.

631
00:19:59,264 --> 00:19:59,817
Wonderful.

632
00:20:00,017 --> 00:20:02,437
Looking forward to being in touch.

633
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:04,999
And obviously whoever has a company

634
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,919
and has some interesting technologies

635
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,039
and solutions, I'm sure that they,

636
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,552
that they can reach reach out to you

637
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,183
and share with you

638
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:13,040
what they're working on, right?

639
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,159
Absolutely, absolutely.

640
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,640
Feel free to reach out to me.

641
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,480
Wonderful.

642
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,000
Thank you very much for joining me.

643
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,680
This is a lot of fun. Thank you.
