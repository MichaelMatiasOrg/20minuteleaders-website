1
00:00:06,295 --> 00:00:10,796
And there you want to see that all high enough as needed.

2
00:00:18,426 --> 00:00:20,386
No, man, you're free.

3
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:23,896
So, y 'all coin welcome to 20 minute leaders.

4
00:00:23,896 --> 00:00:26,026
Thank you so much for being with me today.

5
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,806
How are you?

6
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:28,566
I'm very well.

7
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:29,106
Thank you.

8
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:30,866
Thank you for having me.

9
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:34,006
Thank you for doing great to have an audience.

10
00:00:34,346 --> 00:00:35,016
Absolutely.

11
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:35,566
For you.

12
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:40,926
I hope that people will understand many things that still seem like science fiction.

13
00:00:40,926 --> 00:00:42,536
Let's talk about science fiction.

14
00:00:42,536 --> 00:00:46,392
I got your co founder and CEO of Cogni fiber.

15
00:00:46,782 --> 00:00:49,703
in the space of photonic computing.

16
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:51,204
What is that?

17
00:00:52,224 --> 00:01:01,108
So photonic computing in the basic, it's computing with photon instead of electrons.

18
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:08,531
So our whole technology world today is based on electronics mostly.

19
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:12,583
But until now we didn't have any issue with it.

20
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,073
I mean, it functioned very well.

21
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:16,514
We did amazing things with that.

22
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,591
until we reached AI.

23
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:20,610
AI.

24
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:26,688
And artificial intelligence is really challenging for any type of hardware.

25
00:01:27,927 --> 00:01:36,855
because the demand for trillions of operation every second is very heavy on the hardware.

26
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:47,686
And you can see then the cost of hardware and the cost of operation and the electrical
bills and the cooling it needs.

27
00:01:47,686 --> 00:01:48,526
needs.

28
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:58,220
It's simply because when you want to transfer trillions of electrons every second through
wires,

29
00:01:58,331 --> 00:02:03,671
they heat up and they cannot move as fast as photons.

30
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:17,965
So 11 years ago, I asked myself, okay, we have very nice optical communication, high
speed, very low power.

31
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:25,314
especially the fibers, because they are really, really efficient in transferring photons.

32
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:34,212
So what if we can replace the electronics with fiber -based photonic computing?

33
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:47,103
That means to take a fiber, which is a piece of glass, elongated glass, and somehow to
turn it from something that carries

34
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:56,536
carries photons from point A to point B to something that processes the data when the
photons pass through it.

35
00:02:56,797 --> 00:02:58,000
And that's the basic idea.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,681
the basic idea.

37
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:15,115
if I understand correctly, a big part of it is adapting the photonic technology from just
being a data transfer layer to also having a compute capability, right?

38
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:16,255
Yeah.

39
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:17,235
Yes.

40
00:03:17,716 --> 00:03:26,138
I mean, we can look at the basic example if we want to implement, let's say, a gate.

41
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:30,726
electronic gate, a simple AND gate, OR gate.

42
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:53,226
or gates or you want to implement a neuron like an artificial neural network so if we can
do it in photonics it would be very fast you could reach let's say 100 gig today 200 gig

43
00:03:53,226 --> 00:03:54,475
400 gig

44
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:58,645
And on the other hand, it wouldn't take a lot of power.

45
00:03:58,645 --> 00:04:00,167
It wouldn't heat up as much.

46
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,358
up as much.

47
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:04,586
So that seems like a win -win situation.

48
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:09,048
win -win situation.

49
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:20,311
so tell me a little bit about the where we're at in terms of productization and just for
that so that we have a good basis for the market landscaping.

50
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:30,594
So where are we at today with this technology, with companies building on top of the
promise of photonic computing?

51
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:34,047
And what timelines are we talking about?

52
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:42,409
So we have today in the world about two or three main technologies of photonic computing.

53
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,010
of photonic computing.

54
00:04:44,737 --> 00:04:48,138
The first family is based on silicon chips.

55
00:04:48,364 --> 00:04:49,245
chips.

56
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:55,040
And they are all silicon prototypes for photonic integrated circuits.

57
00:04:55,903 --> 00:05:04,396
And that's adding additional layers on top of silicon chips so they can become waveguides,
guide light.

58
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:05,678
to glide the light.

59
00:05:06,836 --> 00:05:12,757
And most of the companies today use these technologies.

60
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:21,865
The main issue is the packaging of the processors and scalability.

61
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:23,148
scalability.

62
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:32,104
So if we want to implement, for example, HHGPT or other generative AI models,

63
00:05:32,104 --> 00:05:46,121
AI models, we need hundreds of billions of processors or let's say parameters.

64
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:51,084
the downside with photons is their wavelength.

65
00:05:52,005 --> 00:05:54,279
Their wavelength is much longer than electrons.

66
00:05:54,279 --> 00:06:00,759
That means that every component is much larger.

67
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:10,456
So let's say 10 by 10 microns, for example, as compared to a transistor of several
hundreds of nanometers.

68
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:11,858
of nanometers.

69
00:06:13,142 --> 00:06:19,584
So that's about one to one hundredth ratio, could be one to thousandth ratio.

70
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,968
So things are bigger.

71
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:28,901
things are here, but they're much faster and lower on energy.

72
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:33,591
On the other hand, when we look at fibers.

73
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:34,733
fibers.

74
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:39,578
The issue of packaging is similar.

75
00:06:39,578 --> 00:06:40,729
is similar.

76
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:45,880
But the scalability is much easier.

77
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,180
much better.

78
00:06:48,781 --> 00:06:52,703
Because we can just connect fibers to fibers.

79
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:57,666
In regular fashion, you can find the means of them in data centers.

80
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:06,099
so we can actually physically build very large network of processors.

81
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:07,449
of processors.

82
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:26,468
So is this the world that we're heading into that data centers and the data computation
layer within our hardware eventually will be fiber and photons instead of what we have

83
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:27,298
today?

84
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:36,838
So I think eventually, if we look 50 years ahead, we'll have three types of computing
machines.

85
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:37,898
machines.

86
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:40,613
we'll have the quantum machines

87
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:41,995
quantum machines.

88
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:47,588
for specific problems, which are, let's say, very hard, very complex.

89
00:07:47,588 --> 00:07:48,910
very complex.

90
00:07:49,965 --> 00:07:58,861
We'll have the photonic machines, which can do, let's say, trillions of full operations
every second.

91
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:03,341
That means accelerate about a million times from today.

92
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:04,442
from today.

93
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:16,875
let's say instead of millions of inferences per second, we'll go to billions and trillions
of inference per second.

94
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:34,213
And of course we'll still have the electronics for control, for training, for a lot of
things, which are more convenient to, make sure eventually we might go to fully photonics.

95
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,403
photonics.

96
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,106
but it will take a lot of time.

97
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:39,264
So that's the vision.

98
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:40,716
that's the vision.

99
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,794
So yeah, tell me about...

100
00:08:42,794 --> 00:08:44,028
give an example...

101
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:45,120
Yeah, go ahead.

102
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:57,950
one photonic machine, let's say 10 years ago, 10 years ahead, 10 years ahead, will replace
half of the data center today.

103
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:04,590
the data center today okay that's the ratio of computing capabilities

104
00:09:06,798 --> 00:09:07,698
Wow.

105
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,759
Okay.

106
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,300
So, Eyal, tell me a little bit about...

107
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,762
Tell me about Cogni Fiber.

108
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:18,423
now you're an entrepreneur in the space.

109
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:29,927
Tell me about the company founded, the journey so far, and really what is it that you're
bringing to be part of the larger vision of photonics in the world?

110
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:31,648
Yeah.

111
00:09:31,648 --> 00:09:36,110
So, Cogni Fiber is about a very unique connection.

112
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:50,474
between the world of optics and photonics, represented by our CTO, Professor Zev Zalevsky,
which is a world -renowned photonic researcher.

113
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:52,408
photonic researcher.

114
00:09:53,027 --> 00:10:02,807
And myself, coming from both hardware, but also the brain research, as my PhD was in
neuroscience.

115
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:06,206
And I'm lecturing about the brain for 20 years now.

116
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:07,682
for 20 years now.

117
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:17,769
So this combination of hardware, brain, neuroscience, and optics is

118
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:23,482
is something which is unique to cognitive fiber.

119
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:28,193
And we use this advantage.

120
00:10:28,193 --> 00:10:29,773
We look at the brain.

121
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:34,876
We look for how the brain does it efficiently.

122
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:36,627
How does it compute?

123
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:42,239
I what's the difference between regular computers and servers and the brain?

124
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:43,509
and the brain?

125
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,121
Of course we are not alone.

126
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:52,693
The field of neuromorphics is a very wide field.

127
00:10:52,774 --> 00:10:54,104
Dealing with that.

128
00:10:55,904 --> 00:11:00,870
But I think that stepping into the knowledge that I gathered about the brain.

129
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:18,570
about the brain for the last 20 years with the knowledge that I bring, that is the major
advantage and also the source of differentiating the complex.

130
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:39,719
So for example, our vision for inference systems, the systems where the data streams in
from regular fibers in the data centers and streams through the system and does the

131
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:42,781
inference without any reading or writing to memory.

132
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:48,202
That is a unique, let's say, strategy.

133
00:11:48,202 --> 00:11:49,472
strategy.

134
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:51,197
And I'm...

135
00:11:52,907 --> 00:11:58,452
which give us a very strong advantage in latency and throughput.

136
00:11:58,452 --> 00:11:59,532
and throughput.

137
00:12:02,073 --> 00:12:04,725
And how does the product then come to market?

138
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:08,116
What is the product that you're building for the layman?

139
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:16,489
We start with small networks and it will grow gradually.

140
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:23,186
So we look at the text here, we'll have machine learning systems

141
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:27,229
which are very, very fast, especially low latency.

142
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:35,740
They could go for the market, for example, high frequency trading, where every microsecond
counts.

143
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,690
counts.

144
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:47,704
Or they go to data center switching to make the training of AI generative models much more
efficient.

145
00:12:52,968 --> 00:13:03,744
Is the play here to work with the larger hardware companies to bring this to market as
part of their hardware or what is the play to market here?

146
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:10,014
Yes, first we want to show the world that this actually works and works well.

147
00:13:10,735 --> 00:13:17,421
So the first POCs will probably without a large partners and then we can get the traction.

148
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,842
get the traction.

149
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:33,003
Yes, we are in contact with Intel, with Samsung, with Nvidia, and some of them are really
waiting to see how our first products work.

150
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:35,449
They understand the value.

151
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:36,490
value.

152
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:46,658
And so when you show the product and you try to express the value, what are the key
metrics that

153
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:47,797
that you care about?

154
00:13:47,797 --> 00:13:52,065
Is it mainly the latency and the efficiency of the computation?

155
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:52,843
Yeah.

156
00:13:52,843 --> 00:14:01,943
If we look at the first product, the simple ones, it's mostly about real time, pattern
recognition.

157
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:07,983
And we talk about, let's say two up to 10 nanoseconds delay.

158
00:14:08,803 --> 00:14:11,494
That's something which is, does not exist today.

159
00:14:11,494 --> 00:14:13,114
not exist today.

160
00:14:16,994 --> 00:14:20,162
If we talk about future systems, which are larger,

161
00:14:20,855 --> 00:14:33,496
We're talking about, let's say the total cost of ownership of a query for let's say
generative AI, but also latency because the customers do want very short latency.

162
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:37,820
short latency.

163
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:49,766
So people talk about throughput and how to divide the bandwidth between customers, et
cetera.

164
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:51,491
speed is of the essence.

165
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:52,629
of the essence.

166
00:14:54,531 --> 00:15:00,291
And but if you look also, there are some fields that cannot exist today.

167
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,151
So we, and we are enablers.

168
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,011
For example, smart city.

169
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:13,911
So today, if a smart city wants to connect 100 ,000 cameras, they need a data center.

170
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:15,991
Okay.

171
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:18,242
And they cannot afford a data center.

172
00:15:18,242 --> 00:15:19,376
a data center.

173
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:21,183
most cities.

174
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:31,903
And if we can provide them a system, let's say 30, 40 million dollars, does most of the
work.

175
00:15:33,043 --> 00:15:38,782
Let's say only a small room with several other pods.

176
00:15:38,782 --> 00:15:50,834
several other pods That would be enough So then you can have a smart city I mean and the
electrical bill will be you know about

177
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:54,770
kilowatts, 50 kilowatts, and not 20 megawatts.

178
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,092
20 megabits.

179
00:15:58,615 --> 00:16:02,247
That's a basic revolution.

180
00:16:02,247 --> 00:16:03,269
revolution.

181
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:07,498
Amazing.

182
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:08,300
Wow.

183
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,323
So Eyal, what's coming up in the next couple months for Cognifiber?

184
00:16:14,425 --> 00:16:20,569
We are very excited because we are going to present our first prototype, and it's actually
MVP.

185
00:16:24,611 --> 00:16:34,290
And with this presentation somewhere along the next Q1 2025, we are going to present this
technology.

186
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,542
this technology.

187
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:39,759
The aim is at least one giga inference per second.

188
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,941
per second.

189
00:16:42,147 --> 00:16:45,098
and with power consumption of up to 100 watts.

190
00:16:45,098 --> 00:16:46,734
up to 100 fat.

191
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:51,127
And that's like, you know, saying we are here.

192
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:58,206
There's a new technology in the, know, rising up and you better not miss it.

193
00:16:58,206 --> 00:16:59,438
not miss it.

194
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,680
Absolutely.

195
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,613
Eyal, thank you so much for coming and for sharing your journey.

196
00:17:07,114 --> 00:17:09,655
Sounds like we're in it for the long haul.

197
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:23,164
especially it sounds like this is a very foundational and very fundamental technology that
will change how we experience a lot of different existing use cases, new use cases.

198
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:28,028
And of course, we're all getting less and less patient every day.

199
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:32,120
So considering the impact of latency.

200
00:17:32,126 --> 00:17:35,492
and the speed, think that's really the key here.

201
00:17:35,492 --> 00:17:38,517
So Eyal, thank you again and best of luck with Cognifiber.

202
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:38,928
Thank you.

203
00:17:38,928 --> 00:17:41,001
Thank you too, Michael.

204
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:41,963
Thank you for the time.

205
00:17:41,963 --> 00:17:43,264
Thank you so much.
