1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,000
But as you think about

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,680
setting yourself up for success

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,880
from a talent perspective,

4
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,000
from a people perspective,

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,920
because as we all know,

6
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,160
it's the people that make a business.

7
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,120
When you're an investor,

8
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,120
you always kind of invest

9
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,280
in the founder first. Right?

10
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,795
It's 18 B-idea

11
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:17,040
wins over a BT by idea any day.

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,520
Yael Kaufmann,

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,000
welcome to 20 Minute Leaders.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,400
How are you?

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,200
Thank you.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,880
I'm doing well.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,480
How about yourself?

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,240
It's great to be here.

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,520
Thanks for having me.

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,760
It's wonderful having you here.

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,200
I'm so excited to talk about

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,080
some different topics.

23
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,880
But we have to start

24
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,160
with a really extraordinary one.

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,800
How does a child

26
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
go to school seven days a week?

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,320
How does that happen?

28
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,440
Yeah.

29
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,560
That doesn't sound like

30
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,720
the common childhood

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,280
that I know of.

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,040
Yeah. I mean,

33
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,760
it wasn't certainly my entire childhood.

34
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,440
But it happened because

35
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,640
my parents are immigrants

36
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
from the former Soviet Union,

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,360
they're from the country, Georgia,

38
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,480
and they grew up speaking

39
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,880
all sorts of languages at home.

40
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,440
And so, for me,

41
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,360
I grew up in a household

42
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,640
that spoke Georgian, Russian,

43
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,440
Hebrew and English

44
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,920
pretty much interchangeably.

45
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,480
And for

46
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,040
a couple of years of elementary school,

47
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,760
I went to regular school in the US,

48
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,720
Monday through Friday.

49
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,640
And then on Saturdays,

50
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,840
I went to Russian school.

51
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,560
And on Sundays, I went to Hebrew school.

52
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,240
So, there was a lot of fun.

53
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,120
And education has been

54
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,160
a big part of my life.

55
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,720
A lifelong learner,

56
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,240
passionate about education.

57
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,880
And probably part of it is

58
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,720
because I went to school

59
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,400
for a couple of years,

60
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
seven days a week.

61
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,696
That's just [--]

62
00:01:49,697 --> 00:01:50,720
So, do you speak both Russian,

63
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,960
i know you speak Hebrew as well,

64
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,960
but you also speak Russian?

65
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah. I do. I do.

66
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,880
Russian and Georgian, yup.

67
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,680
So, English, Russian,

68
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,880
Georgian and Hebrew.

69
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,200
That's just wonderful

70
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,000
and definitely sets you up

71
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,840
for a very interesting background.

72
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,320
But Yael, other than that,

73
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,560
you also went

74
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,720
to Harvard Business School.

75
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,240
You were an investor in VC,

76
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,440
chief of staff in the series-A company,

77
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,160
and now,

78
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,880
the co-founder and COO of Learn In.

79
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,880
Before we even dive into your journey

80
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,000
which I can't wait to hear about,

81
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,920
talk to me a little bit about

82
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,240
what upscaling is.

83
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,880
Set us up

84
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,600
for the second half of the process.

85
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,120
What is upscaling in general?

86
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,440
Yeah, absolutely.

87
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,720
I hear the term "upskilling it"

88
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:32,560
for around a lot.

89
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,680
And so, for me,

90
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,360
what I'll share is what I mean,

91
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,480
broadly speaking,

92
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,760
is the fact that a lot of times

93
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,240
when we talk about education,

94
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,600
to some extent we talk about

95
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,760
where you went to school.

96
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,120
If someone asked you about your health,

97
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,680
you wouldn't say that

98
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,400
I ran a marathon 13 years ago.

99
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,760
So, what were you learn in school

100
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,240
is really just sort of the beginning.

101
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,360
Right?

102
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,240
It doesn't end

103
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,560
or begin even really with a degree.

104
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,000
It's an entire lifelong journey.

105
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,920
And so, upskilling is kind of

106
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,160
the post school learning that you do

107
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,600
that's often on the job,

108
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,880
often on your own.

109
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,280
So for me, I had the flexibility

110
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
and the ability

111
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,320
to take two years off from the workforce

112
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,920
to go get my MBA.

113
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
But a lot of people don't.

114
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,280
And it's really, really hard

115
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,080
to find time to learn.

116
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,760
Time is actually

117
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,600
the biggest barrier to learning.

118
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,960
But upskilling is,

119
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,560
as we think about all of the things

120
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,200
that have changed

121
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,360
over the last five, 10, 15, 20 years,

122
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,280
of course, someone over

123
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,160
the course of their career

124
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,440
is going to learn more

125
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,720
over the course of the actual career,

126
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,400
then ingest

127
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,560
that formal beginning education part.

128
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,800
So, upskilling is everything

129
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,165
that goes into that

130
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,960
lifelong learning piece.

131
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,480
And that can apply to everything

132
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,280
from the small snack bites

133
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,120
that you learn from a one off-course

134
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,120
to longer form upskilling,

135
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,440
as I like to talk about it,

136
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,440
where it's a one off-courses

137
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
are not going to do it

138
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,960
for getting you the skills that you need

139
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,880
to succeed in the digital future.

140
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,760
Especially when the half life of skills

141
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,240
is decreasing as

142
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,231
the rate of technology advances

143
00:03:57,232 --> 00:03:58,920
faster than ever before.

144
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,040
So, just as you are doing things

145
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,600
from investing to learning

146
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,880
to working, all at the same time,

147
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,840
the future world of working and learning

148
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,920
will all be kind of

149
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,000
more and more intertwined

150
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,040
as you talk about everything

151
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,200
from upskilling

152
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,040
to reskilling continuously

153
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,440
over the course of your life.

154
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,600
I think that's just fascinating.

155
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,560
And I can't wait to hear about

156
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,520
how you actually

157
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,360
help people and employers,

158
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,000
employees and employers

159
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,840
resolve the problem of upskilling

160
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,320
through learning.

161
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,120
But before that,

162
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,520
Yael, take me all the way back

163
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,400
to your journey.

164
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,960
Because it's not a conventional journey

165
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,960
by any means.

166
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,680
You are getting your MBA at Harvard

167
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,440
and which I'm sure

168
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,560
it's a phenomenal experience on its own.

169
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,240
But walk me through

170
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,280
a little bit of experiences.

171
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,120
And why go from MBA to investor

172
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,320
to chief of staff to co-founder?

173
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,640
Yeah. Well,

174
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll start even before the MBA,

175
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,480
because we started even before

176
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,800
with my seven days a week of school.

177
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,760
So, I grew up with education being

178
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,760
a really important part of my life.

179
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,840
And I taught and tutored for a decade

180
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,320
in middle, high school, college

181
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,240
to make money.

182
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,760
And so, education has always been

183
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,760
a big, big part of my life.

184
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,600
But as I sort of went

185
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,800
into the professional world,

186
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
started my career as an investor

187
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,680
for some private equity

188
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,000
and then later in venture,

189
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,040
but had this idea for

190
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,400
how I was going to apply

191
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
all of my passion

192
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,000
for numbers and math

193
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,600
to the business world.

194
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,000
And then found that actually

195
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,640
a lot of what I enjoyed doing

196
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,320
was solving really hard problems.

197
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,760
And so, I found myself

198
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,400
more drawn towards the life

199
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,680
of an operator than that of an investor.

200
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,960
But really, really truly passionate

201
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,640
about helping people build businesses

202
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,040
across the entire kind of landscape.

203
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,280
And spend my two years at HBS,

204
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,880
very much at Harvard Business School,

205
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,120
very much focused on how I could help

206
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,800
mission driven entrepreneurs

207
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,520
and businesses thrive.

208
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,720
And so for me,

209
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,520
it's really important to be knowing

210
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,960
that I'm spending my time working

211
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,480
on something that's worthwhile,

212
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,200
that solving big problems.

213
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,760
And so, a lot of that is

214
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,480
sort of like mission driven in my mind.

215
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,040
But it can range from everything

216
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,480
from food to education to cybersecurity

217
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,560
and all of the ways that we talk about,

218
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,480
ways that we can solve

219
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,680
big problems in society.

220
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,360
For me, I was privileged enough

221
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,520
to be able to take the time

222
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,760
to go to business school,

223
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,240
but a lot of people don't.

224
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:09,920
And I encourage people to explore

225
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,360
what it is that they're passionate about

226
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
and make space

227
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,280
in their own professional journeys

228
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,720
to say, hey, I have a lot of people

229
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,120
doing a lot

230
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,600
of really cool things in my life,

231
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
what is it that I want to do,

232
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,120
what is it that

233
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,480
I am personally passionate about,

234
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,040
and where do I want to spend my time.

235
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,680
Because time

236
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,400
is your most valuable resource,

237
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,640
whether you're an entrepreneur

238
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,120
or an individual trying to make ends meet

239
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,040
and do everything across

240
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,320
the entire kind of lifelong journey

241
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,640
of learning and working.

242
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,400
Being really, really

243
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,120
thoughtful about that is important.

244
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,920
And so, for me,

245
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,960
I've been fortunate enough

246
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
to have those in my life

247
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,760
who I've considered

248
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,010
formal and informal mentors, advisors

249
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:45,200
who've been thought partners for me

250
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,920
as I've thought about

251
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,720
what journey I wanted to go on next.

252
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,680
And so, that's helped me navigate

253
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,720
the roads between early and late stage

254
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,320
investing and operating.

255
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,920
I've done it all

256
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,640
and I feel very fortunate

257
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,440
to now feel like I'm doing exactly

258
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,120
what I'm supposed to be doing

259
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,440
as an entrepreneur.

260
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,120
I think that's,

261
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,120
when we talk about Maslow's Pyramid,

262
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,600
which is something

263
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,840
that I've been thinking

264
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,880
ever since in my

265
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,360
my sixth grade Hebrew class,

266
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,120
my teacher showed us

267
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,480
the pyramid of Maslow

268
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,748
and talking about this

269
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:13,040
the enlightenment piece of the end

270
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,760
where everybody aspires to.

271
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,160
And I think that

272
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,960
what you're talking about here

273
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,320
is something

274
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,480
that really correlates to that.

275
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,320
This idea that

276
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:20,480
you can have your security,

277
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,240
you can have your job,

278
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,040
you can have your daily life,

279
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,760
but really, if you are aspiring

280
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,640
to have that personal fulfillment,

281
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,880
it's about also exploring

282
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,800
our real passions

283
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,320
and thinking how can we integrate them

284
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,280
into our work, into our daily life.

285
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,120
But talk to me a little bit about

286
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,640
this journey with Learn in.

287
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,240
And how do you

288
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,885
even think about before that even today,

289
00:07:41,886 --> 00:07:43,160
you said something interesting

290
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,600
about the half life

291
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,400
of our knowledge and our skills,

292
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,480
that the half life is going down.

293
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,880
What's happening today

294
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,880
in the 21st century

295
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,240
and specifically starting in 2020,

296
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,320
why is the half life

297
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
of our skills going down?

298
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,760
Yeah. I mean,

299
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,280
there's a couple of things in there,

300
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
and I had to even

301
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,280
to parse out knowledge from skills.

302
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,840
Because as you think about it,

303
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,360
knowledge, something that you might learn

304
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,120
in a textbook or in an article

305
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,520
or something like that, that's great.

306
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,240
But how do you apply it to your life,

307
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,280
to your work

308
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,440
and being able to actually

309
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,600
continuously develop new skills,

310
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,800
learn new things, learning to learn

311
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,320
is a skill in it of itself.

312
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,040
And so, being able to do that

313
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,920
in a more and dynamic way,

314
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,360
more regularly, is something that

315
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,040
will set people up to succeed in life.

316
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,240
Because when you think about

317
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,040
the rapid pace of technology changing,

318
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,680
there's more data than ever before.

319
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,400
My undergrad,

320
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,840
I was interviewed the other day,

321
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,360
didn't have,

322
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,600
I was a math and finance major,

323
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,920
they now have a data science degree.

324
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,520
And that's something

325
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,240
that's happened in the last 10 years.

326
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,760
Right?

327
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,720
And data science,

328
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,600
when people talk about it,

329
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,920
we're just scratching

330
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,400
the surface of being able to understand

331
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,520
what we're talking about.

332
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,800
When people say data,

333
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,760
they can mean everything from,

334
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,560
you might need someone

335
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,040
who has a PhD in data science

336
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,960
or you might just need

337
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,240
to teach someone who's a business analyst

338
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,280
and is a wiz in Excel, Python sequel are.

339
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,200
Those are very very different skillsets,

340
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,040
very different profiles of candidates.

341
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,520
And you can learn different things

342
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,880
in different amounts of time.

343
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,160
Costs different amounts

344
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,040
in terms of dollars and time.

345
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,760
And so, being able to parse out

346
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,240
all those different things of

347
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,280
for both a business and an individual,

348
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,000
what is it that I'm trying to solve for,

349
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,160
what is it that I actually need to do.

350
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,040
And then be able to translate that into,

351
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,960
Okay, so I need

352
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,760
the skill set of data science,

353
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
data engineering,

354
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,520
data analytics, data literacy.

355
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,640
I need to just teach people

356
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,053
what does that mean, data?

357
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:32,520
Like how do we think about

358
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,160
all these different moving pieces

359
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,480
in a way that sets us up for success

360
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,520
as a business.

361
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,040
And individuals, they can see like

362
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,760
these are the areas

363
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
that are adjacent to my skill set.

364
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,120
Right?

365
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,640
If you are a software engineer that is

366
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,680
focused more on legacy languages

367
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,720
and want to upskill

368
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,840
into more modern frameworks,

369
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,000
you can do that in a way that is

370
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,160
sets you up for success

371
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,120
and set your business up for success.

372
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,160
And so, as we think

373
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,360
about all the different things

374
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,000
that are changing, right,

375
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,680
the ability to teach yourself

376
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,640
those new skills

377
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,920
and to be able to acquire

378
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,280
that knowledge on a regular basis

379
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,360
and then apply it to what you're doing,

380
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,120
is going to be

381
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,520
increasingly more important,

382
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,600
particularly as that rapid pace of change

383
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,880
continues to increase.

384
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,560
100%.

385
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,680
So, how you know, starting with the pain

386
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,400
and the problems in it,

387
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,120
because I'm convinced. I mean,

388
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,120
the world is changing rapidly.

389
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,800
The things that I thought

390
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,120
that are crucial in 2017,

391
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,120
they are so different in 2020.

392
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,280
And already,

393
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,040
when I'm thinking about

394
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,560
the start of that,

395
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,040
I'll hopefully create, you know,

396
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,120
in eight, nine months,

397
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,600
everybody's asking me, "Michael,

398
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,160
what's your startup going to be?"

399
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,520
And I'm like, I have no idea because

400
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,680
the world is going to change threefold

401
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,916
by the time that I'm going to have

402
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:44,680
to think of an idea.

403
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,200
So given that,

404
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,040
why is it so difficult for people

405
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,720
to do that now?

406
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,480
Why do we need something like

407
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,280
Learn In, from the get go?

408
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,200
Yeah. I mean,

409
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,360
I'd say that there's a couple

410
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,760
of different slices of the market

411
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,080
that have different pain points.

412
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
And so, a lot of where

413
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,560
we spend our time is in

414
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,040
the late stage enterprise sector

415
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
of the market.

416
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,960
And so, startups

417
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,360
that are constantly hiring

418
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,520
and constantly to acquire

419
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,200
these new skills

420
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,880
and apply them day zero, right,

421
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,040
day negative one,

422
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,080
those are very kind

423
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,040
of different types of situations.

424
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,280
But late stage companies,

425
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,080
large companies that also have

426
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,360
these really entrenched needs

427
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,120
but aren't necessarily able to,

428
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,360
perhaps hire the top talent,

429
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,960
the top of their class from Stanford

430
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,960
or wherever, they still have a need

431
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,320
to fill those business objectives.

432
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,800
And they have internal domain expertise

433
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,400
of individuals who have worked

434
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,960
in their companies for 10, 20, 30 years

435
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,520
and have the ability to learn.

436
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,480
And it's just about putting

437
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,920
those pieces together.

438
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,040
And so, to some extent,

439
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,120
it's about helping companies understand,

440
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,960
hey, you know,

441
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,200
firing and hiring people

442
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,240
is expensive and it's inefficient.

443
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,320
And the zero-sum war for talent

444
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,960
is not going to be sustainable.

445
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,240
And so, as companies are coming,

446
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,920
kind of coming out of this pandemic,

447
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,560
trying to think about

448
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,160
how they can hit the ground running,

449
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,880
yes, there's a lot

450
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,520
of stemming the bleeding right now

451
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,960
with a lot of the business world

452
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,480
being turned on its head.

453
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,200
And there are all these

454
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,480
kind of massive problems.

455
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:10,400
But as you think about

456
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,080
setting yourself up

457
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,280
for success from a talent perspective,

458
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,400
from a people perspective,

459
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,320
because as we all know

460
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,640
it's the people that make a business,

461
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,520
when you're an investor

462
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
you always kind of invest

463
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,240
in the founder first. Right?

464
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,260
It's A team B idea wins over

465
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,840
B team A idea, any day.

466
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,840
And so being able to do those things

467
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,000
that we'll be able

468
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,640
to set you up for success in the long run

469
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,520
is something that is very, very important

470
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,040
for companies of all stages

471
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,240
to be able to do.

472
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,640
And so, for late stage companies,

473
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,240
to some extent,

474
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,640
it's really just about equipping them

475
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,040
with the tools that they need.

476
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,680
And so, that's why

477
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,200
we've built features over, I mean,

478
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,680
hundreds of discovery calls

479
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,560
and with all sorts of folks from L&D,

480
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,640
learning and development teams

481
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,840
to various teams within HR

482
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,320
and people organizations

483
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,520
being able to say, hey,

484
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,800
what are your biggest pain points

485
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,120
and how do we solve them.

486
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,880
Well, you can actually create

487
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,320
a business case

488
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,400
for almost inevitably upskilling someone

489
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,720
in your organization.

490
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,800
Investing in your workforce

491
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,080
is almost inevitably ROI positive,

492
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,400
but especially in areas

493
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,920
for some of these digital skills, right,

494
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,000
when we talk about data,

495
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,240
when we talk about digital marketing,

496
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,760
any number of these things.

497
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,000
And so,

498
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,800
it's about helping people understand

499
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,920
that this is a need

500
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,240
that they can fill internally

501
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,840
by being able to invest

502
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,320
in these specific targeted

503
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,960
groups of individuals

504
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,840
to put them through

505
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,760
these various upskilling programs

506
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,320
that are outcomes oriented,

507
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,800
built for the modern workforce

508
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,880
that are remote, online.

509
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,160
Very much focused on skills

510
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,640
that are useful today.

511
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,280
And then be able to apply those

512
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,760
and see the benefit of that as a business

513
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,400
rather than needing

514
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,000
to hire people externally all the time

515
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,160
and not necessarily reap the benefits

516
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,640
of a really great workforce.

517
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,720
So, what I'm hearing is that

518
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,400
I think that I even came

519
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,440
with the misconception

520
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,640
that I was thinking, well, you know,

521
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,680
if you're a startup

522
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,320
and you need a skill,

523
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,520
just hire for that skill.

524
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,440
Tap into the pool of new graduates.

525
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:57,960
But I think that

526
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,920
what you're talking about here is that

527
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,760
you have a range

528
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,640
of these large late stage enterprises

529
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,800
that are perhaps, you know,

530
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,120
quite a few years old

531
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,800
and they have quite

532
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
a few number of employees.

533
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,880
And you know, the turnaround there

534
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,920
is not that quick.

535
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,880
And you have people that have more than

536
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,000
maybe for 10, 15 years

537
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,120
on a certain skill

538
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,640
and they need to upskill

539
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,600
to be more relevant.

540
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,360
And to me, that makes perfect sense.

541
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,080
You know, this company might not have

542
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,800
that quick turnaround

543
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,280
and that competitive edge

544
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,720
to hire that next top talent,

545
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,720
but they have this incredible pool

546
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,880
of very dedicated people

547
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,520
that are already working for them.

548
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,640
And if they can devote resources

549
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,240
through a program like Learn In,

550
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,320
they can upskill them to fit that,

551
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,900
to fit their new digital needs of 2020.

552
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:41,890
Is that about

553
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:43,580
what you're saying here?

554
00:14:43,581 --> 00:14:46,160
Absolutely.

555
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,880
And so, there's all

556
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,800
sorts of organizations

557
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,880
like the AT&T Workforce 2020 initiative,

558
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,200
famously put a billion dollars

559
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,080
to work upskilling the organization.

560
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,200
Verizon, similarly,

561
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,280
has had these large budgets.

562
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,680
And so, when you think about it?

563
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,640
AT&T and Verizon,

564
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,440
they're putting a billion dollars to work,

565
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,800
not out of the goodness of their heart,

566
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,080
but because it's the right thing to do

567
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,920
for their business.

568
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,480
Right?

569
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,280
It's almost inevitably ROI positive.

570
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,040
And so, offering education as a benefit

571
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,400
is one thing that's become

572
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,480
more and more kind of popular mainstream

573
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,240
in these days.

574
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,720
And to some extent, yes,

575
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,960
that's absolutely an ROI there, right?

576
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,040
Attracting and retaining top talent

577
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,960
is fantastic.

578
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,160
And that is definitely where a lot

579
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,040
of the kind of dialogue has been.

580
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,760
But you can even supercharge it

581
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,560
that much more.

582
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,880
When you think about all

583
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,320
of the different organizations,

584
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,080
within HR works with, I mean,

585
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,160
when you have tens of thousands,

586
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,000
hundreds of thousands

587
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,400
of employees globally,

588
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,280
there are inevitably

589
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,560
going to be inefficiencies.

590
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:37,960
And so,

591
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,680
when you can streamline those things

592
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,600
and you can take spend,

593
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,080
that's already happening

594
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,360
and make it more efficient.

595
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:43,960
Right?

596
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,480
Tuition assistance is something

597
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,760
that's been around since

598
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
for the last 40 years or so.

599
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,480
And it's in the US

600
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,800
around the $5,250 mark.

601
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,040
And that's because five grand got

602
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,720
went a lot farther in higher ed

603
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,893
in the 80s, right, versus today.

604
00:15:57,894 --> 00:15:58,640
And today,

605
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,720
we're in a world where a lot of,

606
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,840
you know, changes happen.

607
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,640
And so, it's not just universities.

608
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,200
There's online certificates, bootcamps,

609
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,600
all these kind of new age types

610
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,160
of upskilling programs.

611
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,560
There's all sorts of different things

612
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,840
you can do to dynamically upscale

613
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,520
your workforce in a way

614
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,600
that is highly, highly aligned

615
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,920
to your business outcomes and objectives.

616
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
And you can do it in a way

617
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,280
using existing budget

618
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,360
that is more efficient and effective.

619
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:23,840
I have to say

620
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,400
that I had this phenomenal experience

621
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,040
with the graduate class at Stanford.

622
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,036
It was a product management course

623
00:16:29,037 --> 00:16:30,680
taught by professor, Edison Tse.

624
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,560
We formed a team.

625
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,640
We were five working with Target

626
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,440
on helping them think through

627
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,840
some interesting use cases

628
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,040
using deep learning for their retail.

629
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,360
And one of the fascinating things

630
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,240
about it was that

631
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,080
I was the only Stanford student there.

632
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,040
The rest were Google, Amazon,

633
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,720
and we had Salesforce.

634
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,480
These were workers that came in.

635
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,160
And now, it makes perfect sense.

636
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,920
And I was thinking to myself, like,

637
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,680
how can I be

638
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,160
the only Stanford student here.

639
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,640
And it makes perfect sense because

640
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,840
they had a fantastic time.

641
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,040
They took that learning

642
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,360
back to the company,

643
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,520
the company became them.

644
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,480
And one other thing that you said

645
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,080
that's fascinating to me was

646
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,720
this idea of learning as a benefit.

647
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,960
Today, when you go to a company,

648
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,560
we ask for what's our compensation,

649
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,040
what's our dental,

650
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,920
our health care and [--],

651
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,520
and now we're introducing this

652
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,600
what's our learning.

653
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:15,880
Right?

654
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,640
What is that learning as the benefit

655
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,200
as another way of compensating,

656
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,480
which I think is just phenomenal.

657
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,200
That's so interesting.

658
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,560
Absolutely.

659
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
By the way, we're hiring.

660
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,639
If you ever want to come work for us

661
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,835
instead of doing your own thing.

662
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:27,775
Because you're doing

663
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:29,640
a phenomenal job pitching.

664
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,480
Wonderful.

665
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,680
So, tell me a little bit about

666
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,880
why you're so passionate about this.

667
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,040
I mean, I'm getting excited because

668
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,600
it makes sense to me

669
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,240
that you have this incredible workforce

670
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,880
that we need

671
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,040
to dynamically upskill all the time.

672
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,240
But why leave such incredible positions

673
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,040
that you've had,

674
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,560
started a new company

675
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,120
and why you do that?

676
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,560
Because, you know,

677
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,760
people say entrepreneurs are crazy,

678
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,600
so, why are you crazy?

679
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,720
I'm crazy for all sorts of reasons.

680
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,560
I'm personally passionate about

681
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,720
a lot of different things,

682
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,960
solving big problems as I mentioned.

683
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,040
For me, a lot of what

684
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,680
I've had guide my decisions

685
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
at various points in time,

686
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,000
has been essentially taking stuck

687
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,720
where I'm at

688
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,200
and where it is that I want to be,

689
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,800
and what it is that I'm getting out

690
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,560
of my current role,

691
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,040
and what it is

692
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,280
that I want out of my life and my career.

693
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,160
And so, one thing

694
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
that I'm really passionate about

695
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,080
is helping people find meaning

696
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,960
in their careers,

697
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,920
find the right paths for them.

698
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,560
I'm the go to person for a lot of people,

699
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,240
and trying to figure out

700
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,800
what they should do

701
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,600
with their life career wise.

702
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,520
And I'm also someone

703
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,160
who has known that my,

704
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,200
some of my most fulfilling roles

705
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,680
in time has been as a math tutor,

706
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,960
as a Hebrew teacher.

707
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,640
I loved teaching and tutoring.

708
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,160
I never thought that

709
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,040
I would do that professionally

710
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,560
and have a ton of respect

711
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,880
for those who do.

712
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,800
But it's one of those things

713
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,000
that there are very few things

714
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,960
that are as fulfilling as helping someone

715
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,880
reach their potential

716
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
or get closer to that.

717
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,160
Or help them learn something

718
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,280
or find some sort of meaning

719
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,920
or something like that.

720
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,680
And so that's something that's

721
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,640
always been really, really driving me

722
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,760
from a personal perspective.

723
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,680
I mentioned that education

724
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,920
is a big part of my life.

725
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,240
My mom is a math professor

726
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,280
at the University of Tel Aviv

727
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,480
for 13 years.

728
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,908
She's got a PhD in math.

729
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:07,320
Mathematician. She's brilliant.

730
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,960
As I think about education,

731
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,280
the people who have instilled in me

732
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,560
the value of education have been those

733
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,880
that have never stopped learning.

734
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,040
There are people who,

735
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,080
she still every once in a while

736
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,800
will sign up for an edX course.

737
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,400
And so, there's people with

738
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,720
where lifelong learning is just part

739
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,280
of their innate being.

740
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,880
And I feel very blessed to have

741
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,400
that ingrained in me from a young age.

742
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,720
And so, as I think about

743
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,520
the different moves

744
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,480
that I've had in my career,

745
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,440
I've had a lot of guiding forces, voices.

746
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,800
But a lot of people don't have that.

747
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,360
A lot of people don't know

748
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
what's available to them.

749
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,640
And a lot of people don't know

750
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,040
have a desire to learn, but don't know

751
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,680
what would be valuable to them.

752
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,840
And so, the individual learning journey

753
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,200
is something

754
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,000
that I'm really, really passionate about.

755
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,600
And then when you think

756
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,840
about some of the parts

757
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,600
of he traditional higher ed landscape,

758
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,040
particularly the US,

759
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,280
there's a lot of kind of moving pieces

760
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,520
that have not been so great

761
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,360
for the industry.

762
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,120
And there is a massive

763
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,200
student debt crisis

764
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,480
that is something that I also care

765
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,080
deeply about and would love

766
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,360
to solve in all sorts of ways.

767
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,520
There's a lot of really smart people

768
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,600
working on a lot of

769
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,640
really tough problems in that space.

770
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,040
For me, the slice of the market

771
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,200
that I'm really focused on helping solve

772
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,880
is the people who are working,

773
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,160
the people who are hustling,

774
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,720
the people who are employed

775
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,560
by their employer

776
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,640
and have a desire to upskill themselves.

777
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,440
Who want to learn,

778
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,440
who want to advance their careers.

779
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,240
Those are the people

780
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,320
that I want to support

781
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,960
on their lifelong journey.

782
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,680
And there are people,

783
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,560
who the companies

784
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,000
almost inevitably will want to invest in.

785
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,240
Because that talent is then

786
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,840
more loyal to your company.

787
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,240
They will want to stay.

788
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,840
They will feel more fulfilled.

789
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,040
You will get that skill set as a company

790
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,960
and not have to onboard a new person

791
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,240
and all these different things.

792
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,160
And there is a way

793
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,440
to kind of create all these synergies

794
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,280
by putting together

795
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,680
these different pieces.

796
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,160
And I just really, really love being able

797
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,960
to solve problems

798
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,600
and help people on their journeys.

799
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,560
In terms of what that's meant

800
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,240
for my personal kind of path making,

801
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,760
at different points in time

802
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,440
I've had people

803
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,680
kind of recommend different things.

804
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,560
So, my first move, for instance,

805
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,520
I went from private equity

806
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,520
to a portfolio company

807
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,720
of the fund I was at.

808
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,320
I had a couple folks

809
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,560
who were mentors for me say,

810
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,720
I think you'd be good at operating.

811
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,760
I think it'd be good for you.

812
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,840
You should give it a shot.

813
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,960
And I trusted their wisdom

814
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,000
and they were right.

815
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,640
And so, at some point

816
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,320
I went from thinking business school

817
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,320
was going to be not a good use

818
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,240
of my time or money to thinking,

819
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,120
you know, this is actually

820
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,880
the perfect thing for me right now.

821
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,520
And so, I think keeping an open mind

822
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
and having different people

823
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,480
have share their life experiences

824
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,040
and share their insights and wisdom

825
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,600
has really helped me.

826
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,280
When I was in Venture, I was thinking,

827
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,280
if I want to invest in series A companies

828
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,120
I should probably go work

829
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,520
on a series A company.

830
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,320
And so, that's sort of what led me

831
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,000
to move from that

832
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,320
to a chief of staff role.

833
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,280
And the chief of staff role

834
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,080
was a phenomenal learning experience

835
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,440
and a lot of opportunities

836
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,760
to get my hands dirty

837
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,960
in operations, partnerships,

838
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,080
the areas that I lead for Learn In now.

839
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,000
But then beyond that,

840
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
kind of understand what it's like to see

841
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,600
that the landscape from the back seat

842
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,400
of what a CEO does and see,

843
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,960
these are all the different moving pieces

844
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,480
that happen.

845
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,720
This is how decisions

846
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,000
are made in real time.

847
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,040
And these are the ways

848
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,280
that you actually have to

849
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,000
kind of make tough decisions,

850
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,480
which is really at the end of the day,

851
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,600
what operating is about.

852
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:15,760
Right?

853
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,680
You work with imperfect information

854
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,000
to make decisions

855
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,400
to the best of your ability

856
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,720
and surround yourself with people

857
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,760
who are ideally smarter than you

858
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,840
and amazing humans where you can

859
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,800
kind of have a group of people

860
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,360
who are from diverse backgrounds

861
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,960
because that will almost inevitably

862
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,120
make your decision

863
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,960
that much more well informed.

864
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,440
And be able to do so in a way

865
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,720
that drives everyone

866
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
together in a mission

867
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,840
that is hopefully making the world

868
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,240
a better place.

869
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
Yael, that was wonderful.

870
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,040
Toda raba. Thank you so, so much.

871
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,280
This was just incredible.

872
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,440
The most difficult

873
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,640
and important question,

874
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,480
three words that you would use

875
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,480
to describe yourself.

876
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,040
I would have to say tenacious

877
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,720
is one of them.

878
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,640
Passionate is probably another.

879
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,920
And the last is that,

880
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,160
let's just go with positive.

881
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,040
So, I'm optimistic.

882
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,920
I love that.

883
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,320
I love it.

884
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,240
Yael, thank you very, very much.

885
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,480
Best of luck with Learn In.

886
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:11,800
Thank you. Toda raba.

887
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,240
Continue working in a positive impact.

888
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,400
This is just wonderful.

889
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,040
Thank you.

890
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,560
Thank you. Wonderful.

891
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,840
Thank you. Really appreciate it.
