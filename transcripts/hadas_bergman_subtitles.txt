Hadas Bergman, thank you so much for being on my show. How are you? I'm good. Thank you for having me, Michael. So, you're calling from Tel Aviv but you're actually based in Boston now. You said you left your husband in Cambridge. I did. So, I just finished my first year at Harvard Business School. And we both live in Harvard Square in Cambridge. And I really wanted to see my family. Finished my summer internship. Packed my bags. And came to Israel for a month. I'm actually in 14 days state mandated quarantine. So, I've actually not left this house in 13 days. Tomorrow I'm going free. You literally haven't even left to go downstairs just to breath fresh air? No. And you're still sane? I'm trying to be. [--] I love it. Okay. Hadas, I'm really excited to hear about your journey. And I'm particularly excited to focus on the different transitions you've made that are not very common for people that have come out of the path that we did. So, both of us served in 8200 unit. But you actually took in an interesting path from there. I know you worked in Matrix on data and then product. But then you transitioned into consulting. Which is something irregular for a lot of the techies that come out of 8200. And now, obviously, you're in Harvard Business School, which I think is a story worth telling on its own. The application process and how the first year was. So, Hadas, take me back to your days in 8200. You're finishing the unit. And you're transitioning into the real world. Why consulting? Why do you go that path? So, that's an excellent question. So, I felt like I started going down the path that a lot of people who served with us did. Which was doing 8200 and then doing university. And I worked for a startup for almost three years. I was one of the first employees. With Russell Rothstein, yeah. And I really like the kind of entrepreneurship startup ecosystem in Israel. But I realized that if I plan to be in this community in the future, it would actually be more powerful for me to understand how big businesses and big corporate and government work. So, I really felt like I needed to complete with my tool kit with more strategic thinking and strategic operations of large organization. So, I started basically, recruiting for consulting. Nobody knew what it was. In the US, I feel like everybody knows what consulting is. Right. Exactly. It's like a go to path for so many in the US. But in Israel, you don't even speak about it. When you're friends have graduates from the unit, you never ask them, "Hey, are you going to think about going to consulting?" Right? It's not even an option. Yeah. It was definitely a path less traveled for the people we hang out with usually. But I actually, fell in love with it. I spent about four years at TASC, which is basically a Tel Aviv based strategic consulting firm which works with the largest organization in Israel. Banks, telecom companies, a lot of work with government. And as I started working in consulting, I started understanding how interesting it is to realize what challenges large corporates are having and actually see from their perspective the disruption that is happening to their industries by startups. So, by working with a bank. Or working with other types of like big institutes and seeing what's coming up their way in the way they cope with it, and the way they treat it. It was very interesting. And also seeing how they incorporate technology into what they're doing. So, give me your two cents about your time spent at TASC. What was consulting for you? And what value did you bring these big corporates? Whether it was helping them integrate with technology or helping them understand global issues better. What was the real added value there? So, the company I worked for did not have a digital practice or practice that helped businesses with their digital transformation journey and with incorporating technology. So, basically, I helped the company establish a practice that was for digital transformation and hire people that are doing product, that are doing data, that are doing user interfaces which did not exist in a traditional consulting firm. And I think one of the things I'm really proud of is that I worked a lot with the Israeli government and specifically, the Digital Israel Bureau, which is in charge of digital transformation of Israel as a whole. And I helped them work on the national digital strategy for Israel, which was approved by government resolution at one billion Israeli shekels. And then doing projects for the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Environmental Protection, Ministry of Justice, about how do they take what they currently do and how do they do it in the digital world. And it was a great journey to do it with really great people who care about the citizens. That's amazing. And how long did you spend at TASC? About four years. So, Hadas, now you're at a junction. Because you've done your 8200 intelligence unit route. You've done the data and product route at IT Central and Matrix, etc. And then you've done your four years at consulting. And now, you have to decide, what do I do next. And what do you do is you go online and you write 10 essays to apply for Harvard Business School and many more tests that are even harder than the essays. Why? Why go to business school after all those years? You've had a lot of experience. And you're much older than I think, than the average person, I guess, who would apply. Maybe I'm wrong. But you've had so much experience already in the workforce. And you're deciding, yes, you go back to school, put those on hold and to go and enrich yourself again. Why do you do that? So, just as you said, to enrich myself. I felt that the experience I had was very Israeli focus. The consulting company I worked for only dealt with, or almost, only dealt with Israeli companies. And I felt I was missing the global perspective in it. In the end, we live in a global world. And I felt like I didn't have that experience. I didn't know enough people from the US or from all the different countries. I did not know how corporate or how ecosystems look in different markets. And another reason I wanted to do that is because an area that I'm really passionate about is the area of digital health or health care tech. Which I think, has a lot of potential of improving the health care of, well, basically all of us, you and me included. So, I thought that business school would be a good place to also learn and get into a new field and make this transition. So, it all fit in. But it was definitely challenging. It has high opportunity costs of the time you lose by doing two years of business school. Financial cost. I had to, me and my husband got married, went on our honeymoon in Tanzania and moved to a new country. He's never been to the US. It's been challenging. But what is life without challenge. I love that. Okay. But I want to go back. I mean, everybody knows about Harvard Business School. And so many people talk about it. Very few people are actually there and few people also apply to get there. And I'd love for you to give me a little bit of an overview about this application process. Especially for our friends in Israel who don't necessarily really know what it's like to apply to university in the US. I know that when I came to Stanford, I got bombarded with questions. Wow. You applied to university in the US. You went through the whole process. You actually got in. It feels like it's like this long shot that because we're so far away, when I don't really think that it is. But I want to hear from you. What is tangibly the experience and what things can our friends, back in Israel, can think about as they're considering this path? So, first of all, you need to be in a different mindset. In Israel, you're used to that, basically, you sending your scores and you get it, right? When you apply to business school, they care about who you are as a person. They want to hear your personal story and your personal path. They want to hear about your success story. They want to hear about very different things. So, the journey to get into business school requires obviously the standardized test where you have to do, most people do the GMAT test and the TOEFL, which you need to get really high score SAT. So, that's the minimum. And then you need to do a lot of different essays. You need to re-do your entire resume because Israeli resume basically, is the total list of your responsibilities. Whereas applying to places in the US and especially business school is about your achievements. And what makes you better than your peers. So, going into that mindset of not being humble, but not being too braggy is something that is really hard to transition. And then finding a way to tell your personal story in a way that would be interesting for somebody who excite, that would make somebody exciting about having you there, is not something that I think, as Israelis, we're used to. We don't write cover letters. We don't write essays to get into places. I personally also work with a consulting firm that just helps people with applications. I don't mind seeing it. I work for consulting. So, I valued having somebody on my side who can read what I'm writing and be like, "This is not bold enough." "You can do better." 100%. Well, two things come to mind when you say it. First of all, what you said in the beginning, and I think it's important not to overlook it, this idea that the SAT and GMAT, and your grades are the minimum, they're like the foundation on which these universities are looking at your application and saying, "Is this a candidate that will be able to finish the material in the curriculum?" So, if they got a good SAT, they got a good GMAT, and they got good grades in their undergraduate or a high school, then it's likely a good indication that they are hardworking and they'll be able to simply sit in the class and work. But then what you're mentioning is that they're looking for this extra material about your personality and who you are. What is your edge that will actually help you make a positive impact on the community. And I know that when I sit down for coffee with my admission supervisor, who at the end decided on my journey to Stanford, he mentioned that one of the most important things for them is this idea of community. How can we rest assured that every person who comes in will have a positive impact on the community. Because they said it's very easy to get to fill the whole class with valedictorians, but that's not the goal. And I think that I want to hear a little bit about the specifically the HBS experience. What was it like to be there this first year? So, just saying, you are absolutely right. They care about the cohort so much to make sure it's diversified. That you have interesting people. That you have people that are passionate about what they do. So, definitely right. About my first year, I'm going to focus on the pre-covid, if you don't mind. Of course. The experience was great. It was so different than what universities like in Israel. Because 100% of what we studied was the case method. So, if somebody doesn't know the case method, basically, instead of theoretically learning something new, you get a case study about a protagonist or a company that is going through a specific process that can relate to launching a new product or changing their accounting method or doing something specific. And then you learn the concept, the business concept you need to learn through the case. So, the entire learning method was different. We have 940 people in my cohort in my year. They put us in 10 sections. So, my section had 94 people. And they try to make the composite of each section the same as the large ones. So, 42% women. The same percentage of minorities, Same percentage of internationals in each class. So, you're literally in a microcosm of the bigger Harvard Business School. That you're getting a tiny Harvard Business School, which is a reflection on the greater Harvard Business School. Exactly. So cool. Yeah. And then you study with the same 94 people. They assign you with your seats. Basically, your best friends are going to be the people sitting next to you, probably. Assigns in business school. Yes. And then for the first year, they change your seat after the second semester. But basically you sit in the same place. You have your classroom. Everybody hangs the flags of their nationalities in the back. And basically, you just sit in the same place. And you have the teachers who are amazing professors just rotate through the classroom and you stay in your seat. It was so different than my undergrad experience. I went to Hebrew university. It was just mind blowing the first week. Give me like one of the most remarkable case studies that you've had. Because I think that, I took a few of the Stanford Business School classes. And when I got introduced to this notion of case studies where you  go home at night, you read these 20, 30 pages of the company's journey, and then you try to invoke from that some lessons about, whether it's leadership or commerce or supply chains or whatever. But give me a specific example of a case study so that people who don't know what it is can relate to it. I think one of my first my favorite case study was actually Netflix. Which is a company everybody knows. But we had a case study about them in strategy. Which was about their transition from being online subscription to getting DVD by mail, to basically being a content online streaming. And what I really liked is that they basically, we had interviews with the Netflix CEO. To hear from him as the case protagonist about why did he make this decision. How did he decide that he's going to bet the company on this new thing where nobody, not everyone even had Internet when he decided to do that. So, those are the type of experiences where you have the case protagonists coming to the classroom, or talking to via video and really being engaged in that. I think you remember so much more from the experience and you're much more engaged, than if you just theoretically learn about disruption in traditional organizations as a team. What is the social aspect of the Harvard Business School? Is it very competitive? Because everybody there is a rock star. So, how is the social scene after hours in the classroom? So, it's very interesting because it's not competitive at all. We always say grades don't matter. So, you only get in each class one, two or three. You don't actually have a GPA or any type of score. In the end, you're either a valedictorian or not. That's it. There is nothing else. So, it's not that competitive. And the social aspect is really fun. So, your section is your family. You have section retreats, and section activities, and birthday parties and baby showers and happy hours and beer olympics. Americans take their drinking very very seriously. I need two sentences about beer olympics because I haven't even heard of that. So, beer olympics is basically a competition where you have two teams that face each other. They usually rotate through different stations and they, for example, play beer pong. They play there's a version that's called soccer. It's basically drinking beer while doing things with cups and balls. I'm not particularly good at this. My husband really is really really good at this. But they take it very seriously. Right. That far we know. We got challenged by another section after we had a negotiation seminar and we kicked their ass. And they challenged us to beer olympics And we won. But it was a very interesting experience. We're all adults, right? Harvard Business School, the average age is like 28. People are very serious. And still we had a beer olympics. I love it. What's next on the journey then? So, consulting, products, data, IDF, Harvard Business School. I mean, where do you see your passion takes you over the next, I don't know, five or so years? So, as I said before, I'm really considering and my current hypothesis is health care. So, probably, post business school would either be health care tech or health care tech. I'm still trying to find what would be the best place right after business school. But I think that down the line, definitely starting either my own or joining a great team. Working on interesting health care issues and trying to use technology and data to solve those problems. And having finished now the first year of  Harvard Business School, I think that business school in general, while the value of it it's not controversial, but what is controversial right now is sometimes you have companies like Jolt in Israel who are saying, "Well, we have an alternative to an MBA." Or they are at the end, maybe going out in the real world and doing stuff hands on is a good also alternative to an MBA. So, having finished that first year and having this real world experience in all these different sectors, do you feel that this is something that people who want to grow their mindset on what are the big global issues and how to scale things, is this something really beneficial? Or is this more for the personal experience and to just be exposed to more things? So, I think that you can't separate both. I think that at HBS, this cases, So, the same question, experience versus, go for it. Yeah. So, I think that you can't separate the extra-curricular experience from the actual experience. So, coming to business school, I moved to the US. I got introduced into this entirely different culture. I learned from my 94 classmates that come from all over the world. This girl who is sitting next to me was from Guatemala and the other guy was from Kenya. And some people are from the US. Some people are from the areas that I've never been to in the US. It's the social experience. And building your network and getting to know people that have different business experience is not something, I'm not against Jolt. I think it's great. I just think it's a different proposition and a different experience. Meeting the case protagonist of CEOs from leading companies is not something that you can do without the social interactions. So, I think being part of club is me wanting to transition to health care. Being part of the health care club. Going to meet companies in the Boston area. I just feel like so many things that I value about this experience would have not happened if I had gone for technical skills at Jolt, which is awesome. I'll probably do that in the future. But it's just not, I don't think it's a replacement for one another. So, what is the first step for somebody who's now, they've had a few years experience in the Israeli tech ecosystem or other industries, and they say, "Wow, I think I want to consider going to business school." "Maybe Harvard or Stanford are so far off." "Maybe I shouldn't even try." What is the first step that they should do in your mind to get that path started? I think they should ask themselves why they want to go to business school. And then they should look at their resume and past experience and understand if they have an interesting and compelling story to tell that would want to make someone from Harvard or Stanford have them and they'll be, like a powerful contribution. I think that's in the end, that's what makes or breaks a candidate for business school. And I personally believe that while everybody has a story, sometimes it's hard to uncover and hard to realize that perhaps some experience that you've had a few years ago, which you overlooked, to a lot of others, it's a fascinating story. And you can distill a lot of lessons from it. And I think that when you mentioned, a lot of groups that are helping candidates write their application. It's not that they're inventing their life stories, but they're helping them take these stories, putting them on paper in a way that people in the US can read and really adopt emotionally. Can relate. And relate, because at the end, our cultures are so different. And while there's a lot of similarities, there's so many differences. And I think that these consulting groups are doing a fantastic job at helping international students come in and reframe their stories to the American mindset. And it's not just to English, but to American language. But Hadas, on that note, we do have to end. But thank you so much for being so generous with your time. I have one last question, three words that you would use to describe yourself. Yes. So, I would use, passionate, challenger, and doer. Passionate, challenger, and doer. I love it. Hadas, toda raba. Thank you very much. Enjoy the second year of business school. I hope that it's not going to be all online. I hope that you go back to sitting in that same spot and hang that Israel flag in the back of the room. And enjoy the rest of the quarantine. I guess one more day. Thank you, Michael. Shabbat shalom. And good luck with your project. Thank you very much. Bye bye.
