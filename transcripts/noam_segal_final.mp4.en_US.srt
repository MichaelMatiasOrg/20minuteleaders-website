1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,119
And that sometimes

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,039
the experiences we can create

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,519
can be detrimental,

4
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,919
if not dangerous to our democracy,

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,720
to equity in our society,

6
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:12,300
to so, so many things.

7
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:39,929
Noam Segal,

8
00:00:39,943 --> 00:00:40,757
thank you for joining me

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,879
on 20 Minute Leaders.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,520
How are you today?

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,879
Thank you so much for having me.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,199
I'm good, thanks.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,159
It's a wonderful pleasure.

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,519
I'm addicted to thinking about

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,999
user behavior and user research.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,559
So, this is like an entertainment

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,920
for me right now these next 20 minutes.

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,920
As if I'm watching my favorite TV show.

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm very excited.

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,000
Where are you calling from right now?

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,040
I am in Mountain View, California,

22
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,320
right by the Google headquarters.

23
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,000
Lovely.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,600
So, I'm not going to do a service to you,

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,800
by reading the whole introduction.

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,880
I'm going to let you talk a little bit

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,480
about your journey.

28
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:14,959
But, you know, just for the ear.

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,079
You were a lead researcher within Airbnb,

30
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,479
previously in the IDC, and the Air Force

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,519
and a bunch of other companies

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,440
along the way, most recently now

33
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,680
heading the user research

34
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,840
at the Wealthfront,

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,480
a company that I deeply admire.

36
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,960
Actually, I believe the founder

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,560
of Wealthfront was one of my professors

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,080
at Stanford about financials,

39
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,800
Andy Rachleff.

40
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,880
So, Noam, take me back.

41
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,520
Why user research?

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,960
Why user experience?

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,440
And what is user research in its core?

44
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,200
Well, I kind of I would say

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,640
got into the realm of UX by chance.

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,560
I was born and raised in Israel,

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,080
though I sound suspiciously British

48
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,320
because both of my parents are.

49
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,440
And I served in the military,

50
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,000
in a unit within the Air Force,

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,600
which is in charge

52
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,840
of Israel's missile defense system.

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
And when I left the Army

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,160
after five years or so, I joined Elbit.

55
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,560
A company in Israel,

56
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,960
which it builds a lot of things.

57
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,320
It's part of the military industries.

58
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,080
I joined the team building those

59
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,400
same missile defense systems.

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,680
I was operating in the military

61
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,520
and my interest and my focus

62
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,240
was on the user experience

63
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,320
of those systems, except,

64
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,800
we didn't call it user experience

65
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,920
at that point.

66
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,680
And I didn't have that much expertise,

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,960
if any, really, besides being

68
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,920
an operator of these systems.

69
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,400
And then throughout the rest of my career

70
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,080
since then, I've mainly

71
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,680
just been trying to build my expertise

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,560
specifically around research.

73
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,360
And so at some point,

74
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,320
I decided to leave israel,

75
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,920
moved to the US, to central Illinois,

76
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:56,479
amidst the cotton fields of Illinois

77
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,200
and get my PhD in psychology.

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,720
Really? Wow.

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
Yeah.

80
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,280
And really level up

81
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,520
my research skills that way.

82
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,920
But at some point, I realized throughout

83
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,440
that my passions are tech and research.

84
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,320
And the marriage of tech research

85
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,320
is the field of UX research.

86
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,240
And so I'm really glad that I got to

87
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
move to Silicon Valley,

88
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,560
where I know you typically live as well,

89
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,200
and work for these incredible,

90
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,400
incredible companies,

91
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,440
Airbnb, Intercom,

92
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:26,919
and these days, Wealthfront.

93
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,039
What does it mean, though,

94
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,599
to enter a company as a user researcher?

95
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,360
Because at the end,

96
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,640
the company, you know,

97
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,440
there's a bunch of different functions

98
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,040
that you think of

99
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,160
when you think of a startup

100
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,120
or a big company, right?

101
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,727
All the way from the

102
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:39,000
research and development,

103
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,080
all the way to the financials

104
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,280
and to the strategics in the marketing.

105
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,000
But the user research,

106
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,920
user experience field,

107
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,080
it sounds to me a little blurry

108
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,120
about where that flies.

109
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,080
Is it in marketing? Is it in R&D?

110
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,920
Where is that?

111
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,759
So, a couple of things.

112
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,119
First of all, the way I think of it is,

113
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,999
and you know this,

114
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,479
there is incredible talent

115
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,560
here in Silicon Valley

116
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,480
and across the US and Israel, of course.

117
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,360
And there are also,

118
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,640
VCs we have access to

119
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:11,399
every single imaginable resource

120
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,559
we could need to build anything. Right?

121
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,679
Servers are cheap

122
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,920
and graphic cards are cheap

123
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:20,239
and memories cheap.

124
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,599
And we have tools coming out of our ears.

125
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,799
We have so many tools.

126
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,439
We have everything we need.

127
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,159
But just because we have

128
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,280
all of those resources

129
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,560
and all of that talent, doesn't mean

130
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,240
we should just build anything.

131
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:34,479
It doesn't mean

132
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,199
every idea has equal value.

133
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,959
And it doesn't mean

134
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,680
that that idea will serve people.

135
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,839
So, we need to understand people,

136
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,799
we need to understand how people think

137
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,079
and how people behave

138
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,560
and what attitude people have.

139
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:52,119
Because ultimately any

140
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,639
successful startup,

141
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,959
any successful startup

142
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,639
starts with a problem.

143
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,079
A deep, meaningful problem

144
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,319
that possesses people

145
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,719
and founders of those companies.

146
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,479
And ultimately,

147
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
when you solve that problem

148
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
in a way that makes sense, thanks to,

149
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,600
among other things, research,

150
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,640
it makes all the difference in the world.

151
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:11,439
And that's what creates

152
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,080
incredible companies.

153
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,680
Now, UX research is typically under one

154
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,960
of two kind of organizational umbrellas

155
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,480
to your question, either the design team

156
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,080
or the product team,

157
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,240
depending on the company.

158
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,880
So, I've reported into both.

159
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
These days, my manager

160
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,000
is the VP of design

161
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,400
at Wealthfront, but I've also reported

162
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,000
into products in the past.

163
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,960
It really depends on the organization.

164
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,560
So, what is the job actually, entail?

165
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,520
Because, you know,

166
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,240
a lot of people run by intuition

167
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:39,359
when they're developing the product

168
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,999
and are thinking of a product,

169
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,399
they're imagining what

170
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,039
the user will want.

171
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,639
They are taking that assumption and

172
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,399
they're just developing based on that.

173
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,719
What is the impact that a research,

174
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,200
a user researcher can have

175
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,120
on an organization?

176
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,120
So, the problem most founders tackle

177
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,000
is that they are not their users.

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,800
Sometimes, rarely you may be your user,

179
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,480
but usually you're not.

180
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,720
And so, you need to go to your users.

181
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,400
This is something that Paul Graham

182
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,440
famously told the Airbnb founders

183
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,040
when they waltzed into his office

184
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,440
for their weekly meeting

185
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,360
where they went Y Combinator.

186
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,320
And he asked them,

187
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,880
"Where are your users?"

188
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,320
And they told him,

189
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,520
the 20 or 30 users we have at that point

190
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,920
are all in New York

191
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,320
or they're mostly New York.

192
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,080
So, he said, you know,

193
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,240
"What are you doing here?"

194
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,120
"Go to your users.

195
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,000
Go to New York. Talk to them."

196
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,320
And they realized so many things

197
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,120
from that trip.

198
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,200
One of them famously was that

199
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,240
the places that the hosts were hosting

200
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,840
in their homes, their apartments,

201
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,480
they weren't well photographed.

202
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,800
And people weren't really getting to see

203
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,520
and imagine the awesomeness

204
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,440
of these places they could stay at.

205
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,480
So, Joe Gebbia,

206
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,240
one of the founders of Airbnb,

207
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,920
ended up photographing

208
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,440
the host apartments.

209
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,840
And that was the beginning

210
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,600
of a very important characteristic

211
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,800
of Airbnb, which was

212
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,120
beautifully presenting

213
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,720
hosts homes and apartments.

214
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,680
And ever since then,

215
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,640
ever since then and before then,

216
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,000
whether it's at Airbnb or anywhere else,

217
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,240
user researchers in particular

218
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,560
have been going to users.

219
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,960
And that can be done through

220
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,120
a variety of methods.

221
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,320
It can be done in normal times,

222
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,520
if we don't have a pandemic, in person,

223
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,440
by travelling to users

224
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,920
all over the world.

225
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,080
It can also be done

226
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,040
in much more quantitative ways,

227
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,760
such as setting up to serve survey

228
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,400
or watching users as they use a product.

229
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,920
But whatever method it is,

230
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,280
ultimately we give to our users

231
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,120
because we recognize that

232
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,160
we are usually not them.

233
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,920
And we need to understand

234
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,640
how they see this.

235
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,040
Right.

236
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,800
And I believe that,

237
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,600
from the very small

238
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,720
experience that I have

239
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,800
in user research,

240
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,440
and in my military service,

241
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,320
I was responsible for building products

242
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,680
that hopefully intelligence people

243
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,960
will love using,

244
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,200
and part of the challenge that I faced

245
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,040
was going to these users

246
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,560
and I would know who my users are.

247
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,480
They definitely weren't me,

248
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,600
but I knew who they are.

249
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,320
And I was with them.

250
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,720
And I would ask them a lot.

251
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,560
Hey, what do you need?

252
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,960
Why is this difficult for you?

253
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,360
What would you like to see?

254
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,000
And there is the famous quote, right?

255
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,480
If one hundred years ago,

256
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,640
you would ask people

257
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,880
like what they need to get

258
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,680
from point A to point B,

259
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,880
they would want faster horses.

260
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,080
So, how do you tackle that,

261
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,800
you know, as a researcher

262
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,400
when the people that you're talking to

263
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,600
don't even necessarily know

264
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,720
what they want and you almost have to

265
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,760
read between the lines

266
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,920
and extract that aha moment?

267
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,480
That's exactly the point.

268
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:43,320
We often talk about in our field

269
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:46,519
that we are not trying to establish

270
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,080
what people want.

271
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,520
We are trying to establish

272
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,800
what they need.

273
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,240
And again, that all starts with a problem.

274
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,040
We're not looking

275
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,320
to people for solutions.

276
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,720
We're not asking people who

277
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,000
have a carriage with a horse

278
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,800
what they want

279
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,560
because they would say faster horses.

280
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
What we're trying to understand is

281
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,760
the fact that you only have

282
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,320
a carriage with a horse,

283
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,160
what problem does

284
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,760
that create in your life.

285
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,560
You know, it's that problem that,

286
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,040
is it that you're not able to get

287
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,520
from point A to B fast enough,

288
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,960
or is it something else, perhaps.

289
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,920
And so, I'm not sure what led Ford

290
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,840
and the original car makers

291
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:27,039
to make the car.

292
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,000
But I can imagine,

293
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
it's some of those problems.

294
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,240
So, the key here is

295
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,760
where you keep your focus.

296
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,520
And most research frameworks

297
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,000
help you focus on the needs

298
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,040
and the problem, not what people want.

299
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,760
Again, we have incredible.

300
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,640
Incredible talent here,

301
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,920
amazing designers, amazing engineers,

302
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,600
we can take care of that stuff.

303
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,400
We just need to understand

304
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,720
what the problem underlying.

305
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,840
So, when you approach a challenge

306
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,880
and I'm assuming that a lot of the times

307
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,120
you're approaching these challenges

308
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,280
and you have to start from scratch.

309
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,040
And you have to get to know

310
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,800
what the product is,

311
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,880
get to know who the potential users are

312
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,480
and get introduced to a whole new domain.

313
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,240
What is your process?

314
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,560
How do you go from A to Z

315
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,480
and understanding to then give

316
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,280
some concrete feedback to whether

317
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,240
it's the VP product or VP design,

318
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,120
or whatever it is

319
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,920
on how this product should be

320
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,160
actually built or thought of?

321
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
Yeah.

322
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,240
So, first of all,

323
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,920
it's a very collaborative process.

324
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,200
And that's something that is,

325
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,400
is just growing, I would say,

326
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,280
in the research community.

327
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,000
We work in cross-functional teams.

328
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,120
We work with designers

329
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,560
and engineers and PMs.

330
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,160
And it's important to mention that.

331
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,040
And we start broad, right?

332
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,520
We look at the market,

333
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,600
we look at the competition,

334
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,720
we look at what exists today.

335
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,200
We do a lot of secondary research,

336
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,760
not just primary research.

337
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,160
So primary research is where you actually

338
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,120
go to a user and ask them questions.

339
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,640
But secondary research is just looking

340
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,160
at what we know from academia,

341
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,560
looking at what we know from competition,

342
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,040
looking at what we know

343
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,680
from a bunch of different things.

344
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,720
And then usually start

345
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,360
more on the qualitative side

346
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:05,439
by simply talking to people.

347
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,080
Because we don't know

348
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,360
what we should even be asking them

349
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,520
in the first place.

350
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,080
We don't know

351
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,080
what they're trying to tackle.

352
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,960
For example,

353
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,480
a few years ago with Wealthfront,

354
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,040
this was about finances.

355
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,800
This was about investing.

356
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,880
You mentioned, Andy,

357
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,400
was your professor at Stanford.

358
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,600
It's one the most popular classes

359
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,320
at Stanford, I think,

360
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,480
the class he teaches.

361
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,760
And he realized that

362
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,680
young people, especially,

363
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,400
you know, the sort of people

364
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,280
that were his students at Stanford,

365
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,640
didn't have access to investing tools,

366
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,120
to the same sophisticated tools

367
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,200
that used to be only, you know,

368
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,160
for the wealthy and the very well-to-do.

369
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:48,319
Right?

370
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,000
Who would have imagined 10 years later

371
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,320
that you could leverage tools

372
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,800
like tax-loss harvesting,

373
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,120
even if you don't have a million dollars

374
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,720
in your investment accounts, you know.

375
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,920
So, this is a paradigm change

376
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,760
or this was a paradigm

377
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,680
change in investing

378
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,880
and just one of many, many examples.

379
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,800
Is this an industry that's evolving,

380
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,040
the industry of user research

381
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,280
and user experience?

382
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,080
Do you see from when you started

383
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,280
to where it is today,

384
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,320
is it more popular

385
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,120
or have the methods evolved?

386
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,040
It's maturing a lot.

387
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,160
So, first of all,

388
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,960
the experiences we're creating

389
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,400
are so much more complex

390
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,440
than ever before.

391
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,520
We are able to build

392
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,040
incredible software these days.

393
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,960
But those experiences

394
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,800
are very, very complex.

395
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,440
And so, more and more research is needed

396
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,160
in order to craft them.

397
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,880
We're also slowly but surely

398
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,880
transitioning to completely new platforms

399
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,160
that people have never experienced.

400
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,520
You know, my kids,

401
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,960
who are five and one right now,

402
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,000
they're not going to drive cars.

403
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,600
And they're not going to use

404
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,960
huge phones like I do,

405
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,520
because there's a limit to how big

406
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,600
you can make a phone screen.

407
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,560
And they might live

408
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,040
in some mixed reality,

409
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,920
which I'm not sure exactly

410
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,480
what it will look like, but it's coming.

411
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:13,879
And so, you have

412
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,640
more and more complex experiences.

413
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,960
You have completely new platforms,

414
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,760
up and coming platforms which require

415
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,040
a whole new understanding

416
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,880
of human perception, human abilities

417
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,240
and new problems

418
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,360
at these platforms and so on.

419
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:31,880
And in addition,

420
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,720
the field is maturing in other ways.

421
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,960
For example,

422
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,200
one of the things we've seen

423
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,920
on the development side

424
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,040
and the design side

425
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,000
and the research side is the rise

426
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,160
of ops, of operations, dev ops,

427
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,760
design ops, research ops.

428
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,240
As researchers these days we have

429
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,560
so many more tools and processes

430
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,920
and things to take care of.

431
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:55,239
And so, the field

432
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,199
of research ops has been

433
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,839
really burgeoning in the past few years.

434
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,480
And then one more thing

435
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:03,079
I feel like I have to say is that,

436
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,399
I think, we have also come to realize

437
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,479
in the past few years,

438
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,519
way too late, if you ask me,

439
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,159
that we have great responsibilities

440
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,199
in tech. And that sometimes,

441
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,119
the experiences we can create

442
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,639
can be detrimental,

443
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,999
if not dangerous, to our democracy,

444
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,839
to equity in our society,

445
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,799
just so, so many things.

446
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,480
And so companies are thankfully investing

447
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:29,279
more than they have before

448
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,639
in doing that research as well.

449
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,280
And making sure

450
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,720
the platforms are accessible,

451
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,080
making sure that things are

452
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,680
more ethical than before,

453
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,080
more equitable than before.

454
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,760
That's another important component

455
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,440
of what we do in research.

456
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,880
Wow. And obviously,

457
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,000
being a user researcher at a wealth

458
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:56,399
management company, in that space,

459
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,639
it's a lot of responsibility.

460
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,080
It's a lot of responsibility not just

461
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,720
for the company to continue succeeding

462
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,000
in knowing its users,

463
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,440
but it's also a responsibility for knowing

464
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,720
what the users actually need

465
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,560
and how to create, you know,

466
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,800
delight moments that are

467
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,520
actually beneficial to the users

468
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,120
and not detrimental to them.

469
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,200
And I took a lot of inspiration

470
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,280
from one of the classes I had

471
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,640
at Stanford by Floodgate.

472
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,000
It was a venture capital class.

473
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,040
We were talking about these

474
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,320
delight moments

475
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,160
that a lot of companies

476
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,400
are trying to create.

477
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,920
And it seems that not all of these

478
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,640
delight moments are actually beneficial

479
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
to the users.

480
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,560
They could be sort of artificial.

481
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,640
They could lead them to behavior

482
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,120
that's going to be bad for them

483
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
in the long run.

484
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,640
And I couldn't agree more about this

485
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,880
burden of responsibility

486
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,360
that is seeming to just, you know,

487
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,480
being of an exponential rise,

488
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,480
this understanding, especially,

489
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,360
given what we've seen

490
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,680
in the past few years in all domains.

491
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,320
Noam, what do you enjoy most?

492
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,640
What do you love most about what you do?

493
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,000
Which part of it?

494
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,040
Well, first of all, to your point,

495
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,680
and I think an answer to your question,

496
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,320
I've had some kind of

497
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,880
strange experiences in my career.

498
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:03,479
When I started working

499
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,320
on the missile defense side,

500
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,920
I was a small part

501
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,160
of developing something

502
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,880
that I hoped no one would ever use.

503
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,600
Which is a very strange experience.

504
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,520
Building something

505
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,240
you hope no one use this.

506
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,320
Because if they're using it,

507
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,400
it means that there's war.

508
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,800
And it means that, you know,

509
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,680
your country and its people are in danger.

510
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,080
So, that was strange.

511
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,600
And fast forward to today,

512
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,800
I'm helping to develop a system where,

513
00:16:31,801 --> 00:16:34,079
unlike so many other systems these days,

514
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,639
where it's all about engagement

515
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,839
and making sure that people's eyeballs

516
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,239
stay on a screen

517
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,719
and watch more ads, perhaps.

518
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,079
In our case, to your point,

519
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,039
you know, sometimes,

520
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,359
to do what's best for people,

521
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,040
it's actually about

522
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,000
not just delighting them,

523
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,520
keeping them engaged with software.

524
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:57,879
It's actually helping them avoid

525
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,680
making mistakes and taking actions

526
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,040
that could be detrimental to them.

527
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,160
And to that end,

528
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,560
I think what I love the most right now

529
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,320
is just the foundational impacts

530
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,840
that research can have

531
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,000
within an organization,

532
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,280
and the foundational impact that

533
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,000
a product like Wealthfront can have

534
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,200
on people's lives.

535
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,000
It's really, really meaningful.

536
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,320
And it's incredible to be part,

537
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,720
yeah, it's incredible to be part

538
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,720
of that ecosystem and have even a

539
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,320
small impact on the way things get built.

540
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,000
You know, I think that,

541
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,960
broadly speaking, in tech,

542
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,480
and certainly at Wealthfront,

543
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,800
we are trying to serve people.

544
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,480
Our mission at Wealthfront

545
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:49,519
is to put people above institutions,

546
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,600
to serve people.

547
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,760
And that's not something

548
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,520
that has traditionally existed

549
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,800
in the financial space or any space.

550
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,680
Really.

551
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,200
And as someone who is obviously curious

552
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,960
about people and understanding them,

553
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,960
why would not go through the path I did.

554
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,600
It's such a delight for me

555
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,560
that we are more focused on people

556
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,480
than ever before.

557
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,960
And we truly just want to serve.

558
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,440
And I know that, you know,

559
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,160
we have rightfully, in tech,

560
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,680
been criticized.

561
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,720
Certainly, in the past few years

562
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,200
for many things

563
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,640
that were absolutely wrong.

564
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,080
And there's still so much to work on.

565
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
But I'm a techno optimist.

566
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,800
I am optimistic about our impact.

567
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,920
I think that broadly speaking,

568
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,000
you know, and certainly,

569
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:41,279
when it comes to what's in our hearts

570
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,200
and what's in our minds

571
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
and our intentions,

572
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,560
we want to do great things,

573
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,920
we want to impact people's lives

574
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,600
in a positive way and give them access

575
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,640
to tools that haven't existed before.

576
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,000
And it's amazing when you think about it.

577
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,400
You know, when I think about education,

578
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
because I have young kids,

579
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,080
and watching them go through

580
00:19:03,081 --> 00:19:04,759
the education system now,

581
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,679
there's still so much to do

582
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,320
and so much to improve.

583
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,480
And as I watch us going through

584
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,000
a global pandemic, a terrible pandemic,

585
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,040
which is cost way too

586
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,600
many people's lives,

587
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,840
I can envision

588
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
all of the incredible things

589
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,920
that are yet to come

590
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,800
that could improve our healthcare system.

591
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:23,839
And when I see companies

592
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,520
like Uber and Lyft and other companies

593
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,360
trying to revolutionize transportation,

594
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,720
and I think about the future of

595
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
kind of urban life

596
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,480
and how we won't be hopefully,

597
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,320
wasting so much space on parking lots

598
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,840
and parking structures and commuting

599
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,240
and drunk driving

600
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,120
and all of these things,

601
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,000
if they become something of the past,

602
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,720
that's an amazing, amazing thing.

603
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,680
So, I'm very excited.

604
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,560
And that's the best part, I think,

605
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,080
of being in my role

606
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,360
and just in tech in general.

607
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
And I have to say

608
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,560
that after this conversation,

609
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,760
I'm even more excited than I was before.

610
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,520
I consider myself a techno optimist

611
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,320
and I love that word.

612
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,160
I haven't heard it before

613
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,000
and I'm adopting it.

614
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,960
So, thank you for that.

615
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,680
And I'm energized by your vision

616
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,160
and the way that you perceive it,

617
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,040
and the shared responsibility

618
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,560
that you outlined here that I really hope

619
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,800
to take with me as well,

620
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,320
along with whatever ventures

621
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,600
I get to work on.

622
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,320
Noam, this has been such a pleasure.

623
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,920
Thank you very much for being

624
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,320
so generous with your time.

625
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:27,960
Before we leave,

626
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
I have to apologize

627
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,080
and put you on the spot one time

628
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:33,319
and ask you for three words

629
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,640
that you would use to describe yourself.

630
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,040
And I have to put techno optimist

631
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,960
as one of them.

632
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,720
That's for sure.

633
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,519
Yes, techno optimist for sure.

634
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,200
The second would certainly be extroverted.

635
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,600
I am an extremely extroverted individual.

636
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,080
I am struggling to exist in a time

637
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,560
when we are so disconnected

638
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,520
from our friends and family

639
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,200
and each other,

640
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,880
which is part of why

641
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,960
it's such a pleasure to talk to you.

642
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,520
There are many reasons

643
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:02,439
why it's a pleasure to talk to you,

644
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,560
that's one of them.

645
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,080
Just to connect with other people

646
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,000
is always fun.

647
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,160
And the last one I would choose

648
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,720
is curious.

649
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,840
I have always been

650
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,560
just a very, very curious individual.

651
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,880
I think, I credit that

652
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,280
to my mother in particular, I think,

653
00:21:20,281 --> 00:21:23,680
of kind of gifting me with curiosity

654
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:25,079
and a love of reading

655
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,839
and a love of learning.

656
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,239
And it's the main reason

657
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,239
why I'm a researcher.

658
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,199
I'm just curious person.

659
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,639
Noam, this was such a pleasure.

660
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,279
Toda raba.

661
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,079
Thank you very much.

662
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,039
Continue doing good for people.

663
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,239
And I can't wait to see

664
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,000
what next things you do.

665
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,440
Because it's just remarkable.

666
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,720
Thank you very much.

667
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,160
Thank you. Toda raba.
