1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,640
And I think in order to,

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,160
to make a break out format,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,400
you really need to be

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,920
extremely original and sort of break

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,160
the barriers of a lot of things

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,500
that have been done before.

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,880
Assaf Gil, thank you

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,080
for joining me on my show.

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,480
How are you?

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,400
Not too bad.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,520
Thanks very much.

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,320
You know, I'm not used

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,360
to seeing your face.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,760
I'm used to seeing

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,360
the title of your company at the end

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,600
of pretty much every show

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,400
that I enjoy watching on TV.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,480
So, it's definitely an interesting

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,600
experience now watching you in person.

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,280
But Assaf,

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,960
Gil, obviously is the last name.

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,320
But what's really,

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,720
I think, fascinating to me is that

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,680
you really are a key figure

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,760
in the entertainment industry in Israel.

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,080
And I think that's

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,480
what I'm especially curious to hear about

28
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,480
in these next 20 minutes,

29
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,040
is some of the thought process that goes

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040
behind creating entertainment,

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,840
bringing that to reality and really

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,640
productizing it for the

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,880
market here in Israel.

34
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,720
So, Assaf, please take it away

35
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,560
and tell me a little bit

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,440
about your journey.

37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,600
And how do you even get started

38
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
with even wanting to be on television?

39
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,960
If I'm correct, I would say Ladim

40
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,680
was one of the first appearances.

41
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,718
Well, I actually,

43
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,480
I wasn't born a producer.

44
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,400
I started out as an actor.

45
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,640
I trained in London

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,920
for four years.

47
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,440
And then when coming back to Israel,

48
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,600
I acted in theater

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,800
and a business television here.

50
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,040
After which, I sort of decided that

51
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,280
it wasn't it for me,

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,840
which I'm really happy about

53
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,080
that decision, because unlike

54
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,280
other would-be actors or people who

55
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,360
wanted it and never achieved it,

56
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,040
I was really through

57
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,480
with my wish to be an actor.

58
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,560
So, once that happened to me,

59
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,760
I was really dedicated to producing.

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,200
And I think one of the key issues

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,680
in my career at least, was the fact that

62
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,320
the success, or as you mentioned,

63
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,760
the fact that I'm almost everywhere

64
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,840
on television in Israel as a producer,

65
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,480
didn't come to me very quickly.

66
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,600
I think that for about 15 years,

67
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,920
I was producing sort of small shows,

68
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,280
getting, you know, learning

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,480
quite a lot through

70
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,160
the process of working.

71
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,160
And only at the tender

72
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,320
age of 43, I think,

73
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,480
I really hit the prime time

74
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,800
in commercial television in Israel,

75
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,120
which really was a big

76
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,400
breakthrough for me

77
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,600
and from the word goal.

78
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,080
Since I was on prime time,

79
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,840
i was very fortunate to have

80
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,360
a huge success in almost

81
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,160
every show I produced.

82
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,680
Assaf, I have to pick your brain

83
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,800
about this whole industry

84
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,120
because coming from the tech scene,

85
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,120
you know,

86
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,840
I think the equivalent to you saying

87
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,000
reaching prime time is

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,040
sort of reaching like an exit

89
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,000
for a startup sort or going public.

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,160
That's sort of like the,

91
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,400
I guess, the analogy.

92
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,800
But talk to me a little bit about

93
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,280
how this industry is built

94
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,200
and what are some

95
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,640
of the biggest challenges

96
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,840
that it takes for a producer

97
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,520
to reach at the tender age of 43,

98
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,640
to reach that prime time experience?

99
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,080
Well, you know, television in Israel

100
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,760
is a small marketplace.

101
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,800
And it's extremely competitive

102
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:15,120
because there's a large number of

103
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,480
production companies

104
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,280
with a limited amount of networks.

105
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,040
So, that makes it very tough.

106
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,520
Actually, throughout the years,

107
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,560
i don't think it became any easier.

108
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:37,000
It only it feels like sort of a big war

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,200
going through the years.

110
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,560
And first and foremost,

111
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,680
I must say that

112
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,480
the battle is for great shows,

113
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,000
great ideas, formats,

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,880
if they are sort of purchase for Israel,

115
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,440
IP that is purchased

116
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,280
to be produced locally

117
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,400
from successful shows elsewhere.

118
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,880
And also, here and there

119
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,280
when we do have the chance

120
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,600
to create our own

121
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,400
original shows and IP.

122
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,680
Right. That makes a lot of sense.

123
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,040
And talk to me

124
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,800
a little bit about what is a format?

125
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,440
So, I'm guessing that it's some structure

126
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,320
to a show that might repeat itself,

127
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,800
might be able to then scale

128
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,720
also to other places.

129
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,760
But just talk to me a little bit,

130
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,600
because you have both

131
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,800
the Gil Production side and Gil Formats.

132
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,400
Right?

133
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,720
Which are, they're

134
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,840
like siblings entities.

135
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,720
But talk to me about each one separately

136
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,800
and how they work together

137
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,440
here in the Israeli marketplace.

138
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:36,920
Sure.

139
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,920
So, basically,

140
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,720
the formats I'm talking about

141
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,880
or the formats that we're dealing with

142
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,640
are non scripted formats.

143
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,840
So, we're not talking about

144
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,760
scripted shows.

145
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,320
We're talking about

146
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,560
non-scripted television.

147
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,520
And the format is basically

148
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,800
a very comprehensive concept,

149
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,000
which is very well defined.

150
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,440
And, you know, impossible to imitate,

151
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,640
if you like, without going into lawsuits.

152
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,760
And it's always starting out as an idea

153
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,240
and then being developed further

154
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,160
and further, sometimes,

155
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,360
through violent episodes,

156
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,760
sometimes it's being commissioned.

157
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,440
And Gil Productions is really

158
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,680
a pure production entity that

159
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,320
currently in the Israeli marketplace,

160
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,320
we're producing six really huge shows

161
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,520
for all networks here.

162
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,040
And Gil Formats was

163
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,440
established as a company in 2015

164
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,360
because we came to realize that

165
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,600
we have a lot of our own original stuff

166
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,360
that we would like to distribute and

167
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,040
sell outside of Israel.

168
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,080
And we made some very nice successes

169
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,480
through this IP, this original IP.

170
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,080
Some of it

171
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,280
was produced initially in Israel

172
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,200
and then exported.

173
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,320
And some was actually first,

174
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,760
produced first outside of Israel.

175
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,400
So, that was even more exciting.

176
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,480
So, I mean, let's say that I'm a young,

177
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,640
a young media entrepreneur

178
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,160
and I have an idea for a show

179
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,840
that is called Come Eat with Me.

180
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,800
By the way, I love that show.

181
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,440
And I want to put it on.

182
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,720
Come down with me.

183
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,160
I want to actually start this up as

184
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,000
a real proper show.

185
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,480
What are some of the big milestones

186
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,400
that I'll have to go through

187
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,080
as a media entrepreneur

188
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,040
or is coming in with this format,

189
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,720
whether I pitch it

190
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,200
to Gil Formats or somebody else,

191
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,160
what are some of the steps

192
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,880
that I'll have to go through?

193
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,400
I think that unlike, perhaps tech

194
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,480
ideas that might be

195
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,720
sometimes easier to launch, I find,

196
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,080
because I'm getting pitched

197
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,120
on an average of two

198
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,160
formats at least a day,

199
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,560
so it's hundreds per year.

200
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,840
And I must say that

201
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,600
most of them are not that good because,

202
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,880
You're like a venture capital investor.

203
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,240
In a way, I am. Yes.

204
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,960
I think that some of the ideas are very,

205
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,360
you know,

206
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,840
they are very much

207
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,040
similar to other things

208
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,840
that are on air with slight differences

209
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,280
that don't really make

210
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,920
that much of a difference.

211
00:08:57,921 --> 00:09:00,240
And I think in order to make

212
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,080
a break out format, you really need to be

213
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,640
extremely original and sort of break

214
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,840
the barriers of a lot of things

215
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,760
that have been done before.

216
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,400
On the other hand, I think that some

217
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,680
of the ideas I'm being pitched with

218
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,840
are okay, great, actually on paper,

219
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,320
but once you go into the nitty gritty

220
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,160
of producing them,

221
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,640
of making them a television show,

222
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,600
most people don't really understand

223
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,520
the barriers of television or how

224
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,640
a television show is produced.

225
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,280
And that's why some of the ideas are

226
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,800
purely hypothetical, because

227
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,600
they cannot get to a practical

228
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,080
you know,

229
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,320
they cannot really be achieved.

230
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,360
So, it's a really tough process.

231
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:54,720
But if you do have an original

232
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,480
successful format, it can potentially

233
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,880
bring you lots of money and lots of,

234
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,960
you know, it could be a big springboard

235
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,320
if you do manage to create something

236
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,760
original that could be successful.

237
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,840
Right. Talk to me a little bit

238
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,280
about reality television.

239
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,960
That's also a big part of what you do.

240
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,560
Why do I love reality TV so much?

241
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,040
Why do I find myself able to sit through

242
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,760
watching an entire season

243
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,160
of a reality show without stopping?

244
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,880
I think that's maybe the only thing

245
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,320
I can do without stopping for hours.

246
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,600
Why is that?

247
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:39,600
I think that, you know,

248
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,360
what always works on television

249
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,120
is a story and it's always

250
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,000
a personal story and there's always need,

251
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,400
there's a need for some sort of stake

252
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
of what the people are going through.

253
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
There's a challenge,

254
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,440
there's something out of the ordinary.

255
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,360
Some of the reality shows that we all know

256
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,840
when wanting to achieve the

257
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,040
you know, this challenge,

258
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,400
for instance, in Survivor,

259
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,520
they could send people to a remote island

260
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,440
to starve them and put them through

261
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,320
impossible challenges just to get

262
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,080
the personal story, the personal truth.

263
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,120
Some other shows,

264
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,640
which I've been also fortunate to produce

265
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,040
there the challenge is that

266
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,520
naturally, for instance, one of the

267
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,367
successful show

268
00:11:38,368 --> 00:11:40,440
I produced a few years ago

269
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,560
in Israel was called Baby Boom.

270
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,960
In the original UK version,

271
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,280
it's called One Born Every Minute.

272
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,720
And what we did was just document

273
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,320
births in a hospital ward.

274
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,720
And it was extremely emotional

275
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,880
and dramatic,

276
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,280
simply just by putting a camera there.

277
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,080
Because the challenge was there,

278
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,360
we didn't need to create it.

279
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,680
Some reality shows have to manipulate

280
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,560
and create the challenge and the drama,

281
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,200
whereas some of the other shows,

282
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,240
the drama is sort of inherent

283
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,600
in the process.

284
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,240
I prefer the other type of shows

285
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:30,720
because I think that, nowadays,

286
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,200
viewers are very critical.

287
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,200
They can see the manipulations.

288
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,160
And I think that as long as the person

289
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,440
involved, the person on television

290
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,560
is going through something real,

291
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,960
it's better.

292
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,680
And I think most of my shows

293
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,320
were focus on that.

294
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,640
I think that's fascinating

295
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,000
and I have to say that I agree.

296
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,320
I enjoy watching both

297
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,360
the very early seasons of these shows,

298
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,440
but I also enjoy watching

299
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,720
the later season of these shows

300
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,040
and the new reality shows like Baby Boom,

301
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,360
which I also love.

302
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,720
And you can tell the difference.

303
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,560
You can tell the difference

304
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,240
in authenticity.

305
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,640
And you can tell when that person

306
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,040
is going through an emotional experience

307
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,440
that is very relevant

308
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,000
that you can actually connect with.

309
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,600
But Assaf, tell me a little bit about,

310
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,160
about the trajectory

311
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,960
of where we're headed

312
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,840
with television and reality TV also.

313
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,960
So, what have been

314
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,080
some of the major changes

315
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,440
aside from the authenticity

316
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,560
in the past decade or so?

317
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,560
And where are we headed

318
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,320
towards in the future?

319
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,400
Well, you know, everyone is talking about

320
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,240
the problem of linear television

321
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,840
and is it going to still be relevant.

322
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,480
I think it is.

323
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,640
Because I think

324
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,880
the challenge of current

325
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,280
day television is

326
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,440
television really needs

327
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,120
to reinvent itself

328
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,520
as a must see platform.

329
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,240
You can watch Netflix,

330
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,120
you can binge shows and obviously

331
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,560
have lots of fun with it.

332
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,520
But I think the challenge of linear

333
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,320
television is to be able to

334
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,240
offer viewers something

335
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,200
that they really need to see,

336
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,360
they won't be able to see

337
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,520
on the SVOD platforms.

338
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,360
And I think, I do see

339
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,320
a long future of television ahead of us.

340
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,200
You know, my recent show in Israel

341
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,840
which is a huge success everywhere,

342
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,480
The Messenger, is something like that

343
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,880
because it is something

344
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,800
that has a great deal

345
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,400
of engagement with viewers.

346
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
People need to be involved.

347
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,520
They want to be involved.

348
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:59,200
It's the talk the next day, everywhere.

349
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,280
And it's the type of show which

350
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,480
brings back the value of television.

351
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,880
And I think that's part

352
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,720
of the things I like to do,

353
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,200
because I do like to produce things

354
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,760
which are a bit of an adventure,

355
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,120
a bit of something refreshing,

356
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,480
something different.

357
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,760
And I think,

358
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,840
that was one of the reasons

359
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,920
why I, you know,

360
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,920
took an option on this format very early

361
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,440
before it launch in the US

362
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,880
and some other format as well.

363
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,320
When I felt that there is something

364
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,120
that is different, there is an adventure

365
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,600
in having this on television.

366
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,360
And I think that's one of the key issues.

367
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,240
Not doing more of the same,

368
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,840
doing things which are

369
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,160
completely different.

370
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,680
Assaf, I think that's just incredible.

371
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,760
Tell me a little bit about yourself.

372
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,040
Why are you so excited about

373
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,120
starting new shows

374
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,720
and continuing to innovate?

375
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,960
You mentioned that you started off really

376
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,560
getting into the bits and pieces

377
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,200
and the exciting parts at 43.

378
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,000
But why today?

379
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,600
Why do you still enjoy getting pitched

380
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,240
at least two ideas per day and then

381
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,200
continuing to do new formats?

382
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,000
You know, I love what I do.

383
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,800
It's really not something that

384
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,680
when I wake up in the morning,

385
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,560
I don't have any qualms

386
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,800
about what I'm doing.

387
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,200
I don't have other dreams.

388
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,640
It's not like I wish I would have,

389
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,000
I would do something else.

390
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,240
It never, never happened to me.

391
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,280
I really am totally enchanted

392
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,840
with what I'm doing.

393
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,400
And I love to create.

394
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,520
And I think part of the

395
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,760
magic of creating for television

396
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,320
is being able to

397
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,280
use a lot of your senses

398
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,280
and both intellect and emotions.

399
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,160
But I would say

400
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,600
first and foremost, intuition.

401
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,680
I think television for me, at least,

402
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,320
television works a lot on intuition.

403
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:15,360
And that's why I love this field.

404
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,600
Because you're going through

405
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,440
a lot of unknowns.

406
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,000
You're going through

407
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,200
a lot of black holes.

408
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,320
You're not sure what's going to happen

409
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,600
when you know,

410
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,040
how you're going to come out

411
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,760
of the other side.

412
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,640
And that's part

413
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,320
of the magic of television.

414
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,800
And that's why it's so exciting.

415
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,920
And it always has been.

416
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,240
What's been the greatest challenge

417
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,360
that you had to overcome

418
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,200
in doing the amazing work

419
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,960
that you're doing right now?

420
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,920
Well, the biggest challenges

421
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:52,560
are me pitching to other people,

422
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,520
of course.

423
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,520
So, you're talking about

424
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,800
as if I'm a VC being pitched to,

425
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,520
but I'm also

426
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,080
pitching to the networks in Israel,

427
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,400
I'm pitching to networks abroad,

428
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,400
to production companies abroad.

429
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,680
That's always a big challenge.

430
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,680
Because normally,

431
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,120
you're in a position

432
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,080
when you're pitching to people

433
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,400
who are very anxious

434
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,680
about making bold moves

435
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,040
and taking risks.

436
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,320
And if you are being adventurous,

437
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,760
which is what I like to do,

438
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,520
it's always

439
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,720
a challenge pitching to people

440
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,440
who are almost prone to taking risks,

441
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,760
risk-verse people.

442
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,080
And that's, I would say,

443
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,240
my biggest challenge.

444
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,080
I love that.

445
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,760
And if you look over,

446
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,800
you know, the incredible career

447
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,720
that you've had, and I have to,

448
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,240
first of all,

449
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,160
I have to say thank you,

450
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,680
because I think that, you know,

451
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,520
besides from being an innovator

452
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,360
and creating all these things,

453
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,480
you really you impacted so many lives.

454
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,560
And you know, I can still recall it,

455
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,600
and I will never forget

456
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,920
those Saturday nights

457
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,320
when I would sit with my family,

458
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,240
everybody together

459
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,160
huddle in front of the screen

460
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,560
because we're excited about

461
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,760
somebody's journey,

462
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,000
whether it's through Baby Boom

463
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,200
or another reality TV.

464
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,800
I think it brings people together.

465
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,880
I think it creates excitement

466
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,920
and creates an internal excitement

467
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,080
for every person watching it.

468
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,920
And I think that allowing us

469
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,520
to experience these emotions is a gift.

470
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,960
And so, I want to thank you

471
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,200
for giving us that gift.

472
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,160
And also, thank you for being

473
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,040
so generous with your time

474
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,240
and coming here.

475
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,720
Assaf, before we leave, I have to ask you

476
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,680
the most important question,

477
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,920
which is three words

478
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,800
that you would use to describe yourself.

479
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,840
Well, I'll pick up on a lot of things

480
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,480
I said here, I would probably say,

481
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,840
it's a bit embarrassing,

482
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,920
but I would probably say that

483
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,920
I'm intuitive, I'm experienced because

484
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,280
it took me some time before I made a move

485
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,480
and when successful.

486
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,920
And I'm adventurous.

487
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,240
These are the three things

488
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,040
I can say about me.

489
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,560
I love it.

490
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,240
Assaf, thank you so, so much.

491
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,440
This was really, really wonderful.

492
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,760
And thank you very much.

493
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,720
Stay safe and stay healthy.

494
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,720
Thank you.

495
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,200
Thank you very much, Michael.

496
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,520
Thank you.
