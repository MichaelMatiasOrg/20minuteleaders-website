1
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,840
Donna Griffit, thank you so much

2
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,360
for joining me.

3
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,280
How are you?

4
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,920
I'm great.

5
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
Thank you so much, Michael.

6
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,000
I just read,

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
when somebody asks you,

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,280
"These days, how are you?"

9
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,840
You're supposed to say,

10
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,280
"Well, I'm 2020 great."

11
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,680
which means

12
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,720
... life is pretty good,

13
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,640
cannot complain.

14
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,040
Well, we're going to talk soon about

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,280
how actually during covid

16
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,000
you accelerated your business

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,320
to over 150% growth,

18
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,360
but we're gonna leave that

19
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,720
to the later half of the conversation,

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,680
because I'd like to start off

21
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,600
with your journey.

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,080
Donna, you're a worldwide known

23
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,320
storyteller. You've helped

24
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,640
thousands of entrepreneurs,

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,800
founders, CEOs, executives

26
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,280
work through their stories.

27
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,280
And the way that you're saying it

28
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,400
is to turn raw data

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,440
into something meaningful and magical

30
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,040
that others buy into and engage with.

31
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,280
It's never been more relevant than today,

32
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,520
and I think that

33
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,280
as I'm watching the world unfold,

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,960
especially in terms

35
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,640
of politics and entrepreneurship,

36
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,800
it's all about storytelling

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
and it's all about framing.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,800
But let's go from the beginning.

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,320
Donna, who are you?

40
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,080
Oh, wow. Who am I?

41
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,160
That's a trick question.

42
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,840
You could go anywhere with that.

43
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,520
So, I am a storyteller

44
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,240
through and through.

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,560
It's funny that sometimes

46
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,920
your professions find you.

47
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,200
So, I've been the polisher of diamonds,

48
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,640
as somebody called me,

49
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,480
for the past 16 years.

50
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,880
I love that, polisher of diamonds.

51
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,080
Just to give you an example,

52
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,360
yesterday, I had three two-hour meetings

53
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,240
where I wrote three investor decks.

54
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
One was for a company

55
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,680
doing data for blockchain exchanges.

56
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,720
Another one was a medical device

57
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,840
for repairing the heart valve.

58
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,520
And the third one was a marketplace

59
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,400
for artists to come home and do their art,

60
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,760
their cooking, their whatever.

61
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,080
So, I mean, that's what

62
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,760
my weeks look like.

63
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,520
I get to work with the best,

64
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,040
the brightest, the most amazing companies.

65
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,560
And what they all have in common,

66
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,640
other than the fact that they're brilliant,

67
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,120
is they all struggle to tell their story.

68
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,760
And sometimes

69
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,720
people hear storyteller they're

70
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,680
like, "What's that?"

71
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,080
And what it really is

72
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,400
is it's messages that compel.

73
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,360
When you're listening to a story,

74
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,640
you should be so engaged and enthralled

75
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,400
that you don't even feel a sense of time,

76
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,360
you're not distracted by other things,

77
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,880
you're synced completely to the speaker.

78
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,120
And when our wavelengths are synced up,

79
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,480
and there's actually studies that show

80
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,280
that storyteller and story listener

81
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,360
are synced up,

82
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,800
the influence is much bigger.

83
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,080
So, stories can really

84
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,600
catapult our business.

85
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,960
Why is it so hard?

86
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,640
Telling a story,

87
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,360
you start off with a beginning,

88
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,400
then you have a middle and an end,

89
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,640
you put a conflict in the middle,

90
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,160
and then you finish with a

91
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,400
Hollywood happy ending.

92
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,560
... so easy.

93
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,320
So, what I think it is

94
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,320
it's the, I call it the baby syndrome.

95
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,440
When you have a baby,

96
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,960
and people are like "So how's the baby?"

97
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
You pull out your phone

98
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,080
and you start showing

99
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,000
hundreds and hundreds of pictures,

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,120
and you're oblivious to the fact that

101
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,000
people are glazed over.

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,760
And you can receive the same

103
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,240
kind of fun effect by showing two or three

104
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,560
and be done with it.

105
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,280
Right.

106
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,720
So, the same thing with founders.

107
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,520
I feel that there's a lot of overtelling, overselling,

108
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,440
not being clear,

109
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,160
and they overwhelm their users.

110
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,760
So, I sometimes call it

111
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,880
it's like a first date.

112
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,680
Upon your first date,

113
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,520
you start talking about

114
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,840
your entire dating history,

115
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,880
where you want to get married,

116
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,240
how many kids you want to have.

117
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,920
There's a good chance

118
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,040
you're not gonna see that person again.

119
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,960
So, the same thing

120
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,400
with an investor or a salesman;

121
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:52,920
you want to give them

122
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,280
just what they need to know

123
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,160
to intrigue them and want them to go

124
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,240
on another date with you.

125
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,480
So, founders, executives,

126
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,600
everyone gets lost in the weeds.

127
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,560
And obviously, when you're meeting

128
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,960
these different founders and executives,

129
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,120
you're meeting them across

130
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,160
all different stages

131
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,520
of their life cycle, right,

132
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,760
from very early stage

133
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
to very late stage.

134
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,000
And I'm sure that the messaging

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,360
is also different in how they convey.

136
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,640
Some of them is more data driven,

137
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,080
some of that is more dreamlike

138
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,600
and let's go on a journey

139
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,720
of what the future could hold

140
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,760
for the world.

141
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,080
And you have to do that.

142
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,360
That, I think, is the key thing

143
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,960
that a lot of people miss

144
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,760
that investors really look for

145
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,120
is that North Star, that vision.

146
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,240
Ask yourself five years from now

147
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,400
what will your company be

148
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,520
for your industry or beyond your industry.

149
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,560
What are you changing,

150
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,160
what's the seismic shift

151
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,440
that's happening thanks to you?

152
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,760
And that's what you want to look towards.

153
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,640
What you're doing now

154
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,080
may just be the first step in that,

155
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,160
and that's fine.

156
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,880
You got to start somewhere,

157
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,920
but you need to be able

158
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,720
to paint the picture

159
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,400
of the much bigger journey.

160
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,120
100%.

161
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,960
So Donna,

162
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
you start off your life orthodox.

163
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,520
At 16, you know

164
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,200
what you're going to be doing

165
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,040
with your life.

166
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,520
Walk me back to your childhood.

167
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,160
I have to understand

168
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,080
how does one become an expert storyteller

169
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
to the point where

170
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,080
they're working with thousands

171
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,600
of entrepreneurs and executives?

172
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,400
So, yeah. My parents became orthodox.

173
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,320
We moved to Israel when I was 11,

174
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,040
and we became Orthodox

175
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,840
a few years before that,

176
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,680
and I spent many years back and forth

177
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,520
between Israel and the US.

178
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,840
I've always been a hybrid,

179
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,280
which at first as a kid

180
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,680
is very hard to take,

181
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,760
'cause when I moved to Israel,

182
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,760
I was like, Oh, she's so American.

183
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,840
And so, and you try to grow the skin

184
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,640
to be more robust.

185
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,040
And then I moved back

186
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,520
to get my master's at NYU

187
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,280
in drama therapy,

188
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,040
which is what I discovered at 16.

189
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,280
It's like they put together the perfect,

190
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,400
thankfully I knew

191
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,680
that there was a masters at NYU.

192
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,960
I knew that's what I wanted to do,

193
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,680
and everything I did up until then

194
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,600
was geared towards

195
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,920
getting into that program. And then at-

196
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,560
Drama therapy?

197
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,440
Drama therapy,

198
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,760
that's what my masters is in.

199
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,800
What's drama therapy?

200
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,240
It's a combination of psychology

201
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,800
and theatric arts.

202
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,120
My thesis was written about

203
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,720
the internship that I did

204
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,320
at Bellevue Hospital

205
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,800
with homeless, mentally ill adult men.

206
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,520
It was an inpatient program

207
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
that they were out of the hospital ward

208
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,640
and moving into.

209
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,160
So, I did six months there

210
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,280
just as 9/11 happened.

211
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,080
So, I experienced

212
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,960
what it was to be homeless

213
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,200
'cause we were evacuated on 9/11

214
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,800
and I lived ... Financial District.

215
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,920
So, it's one of those really

216
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,760
pivotal times in the world,

217
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,760
and here we are at another one.

218
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,880
So, stories become so powerful,

219
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,680
and my thesis was a lot about

220
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,000
the stories of how these men

221
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,080
were processing and dealing.

222
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,160
So, how did I get

223
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,640
to corporate storytelling

224
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,960
out of that?

225
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,840
I realized that I had always loved acting.

226
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,520
And I knew something in me,

227
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,720
I couldn't be an actress

228
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,800
if I wanted to be able

229
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,880
to put food on the table,

230
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,080
so I needed to find something

231
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,560
to combine it.

232
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,520
That was why drama therapy,

233
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,200
and then I discovered

234
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,880
the drama therapy salary

235
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,040
was about that of a struggling artist.

236
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,960
So, I started thinking,

237
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,040
"What else? What else?"

238
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,920
I enrolled in a post master's program

239
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,600
for training

240
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,880
and organizational development

241
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,840
after I had one of these "aha moments"

242
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,360
that somebody said they had a friend

243
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,160
that traveled the globe giving workshops.

244
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,480
And I was like,

245
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,680
"That's what I want to do with my life!"

246
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,560
So, I found that,

247
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,360
sent my resume

248
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,400
to the first place on Craigslist,

249
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,000
of all places,

250
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,640
that was looking for corporate trainers.

251
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,520
Craigslist, wow.

252
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,640
Yeah. And I was with

253
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,920
Boyer Communications Group,

254
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,160
a wonderful boutique firm

255
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,400
in New York for over 12 years.

256
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,760
Brett Boyer taught me everything I know.

257
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,080
He was like a father and a mentor.

258
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,000
And I learned on the job.

259
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I traveled all around

260
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,120
giving these workshops.

261
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,880
And then transferred my skill set

262
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,320
to startup stories.

263
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,160
Unbelievable. Just unbelievable.

264
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,440
So, going back to startup stories,

265
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,480
walk me through

266
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,120
what a meeting with you would be like.

267
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,360
So, if I'm coming in and I'm saying,

268
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,400
"Donna, I have this big thing

269
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,920
that I have to do. I have to raise capital,

270
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,800
I have to go give a keynote

271
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,400
about my product,

272
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,320
I have a sales pitch

273
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,640
to this crazy company"

274
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,160
What does our engagement look like?

275
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,640
What does it mean

276
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,360
to work with a storyteller?

277
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,280
So, what happens is I send you

278
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,400
a cheat sheet for whatever,

279
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,040
if it's a sales deck, an investor deck,

280
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,360
a five minute pitch for a demo day,

281
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,920
and you organize your data.

282
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,440
It's almost like

283
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,280
I'm giving you a shopping list and saying

284
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,760
Please go to Whole Foods

285
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,760
or some high quality store,

286
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,600
bring me premium ingredients,

287
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,640
and I will cook you

288
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,000
the meal in the session.

289
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,480
So, everything happens in real time.

290
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,960
We have a two hour session,

291
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,800
we dive right in.

292
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,840
And I have a filter in my brain

293
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,240
that's backed by AI,

294
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,480
and ML and deep learning and NLP.

295
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,240
I have no idea what's in there,

296
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,360
but something happens

297
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,400
and out comes the story

298
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,720
and I start writing.

299
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,160
And it's very collaborative

300
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,000
'cause then the founder

301
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,200
sees what I'm writing,

302
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
and I stop and they say,

303
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,520
"Okay, that part's great.

304
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,200
That part we need to tweak a bit."

305
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,560
And then we iterate on the spot,

306
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,400
creating the optimal story

307
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,360
that they feel 150% confident about.

308
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,320
It's important to me

309
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,160
that I'm taking their voice

310
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,840
and elevating it.

311
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,920
People don't tend to write

312
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,400
about themselves in superlatives

313
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,760
and in braggadocios kind of ways,

314
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,120
which it's not a bad thing.

315
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,200
You need to be able

316
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,280
to show that confidence.

317
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,400
Let your numbers speak for yourself.

318
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,920
And so, it's getting into the right flow.

319
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,360
It's almost like

320
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,480
putting a puzzle together,

321
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,760
you have to move pieces around.

322
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,640
And like yesterday

323
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,000
I finished one of the sessions,

324
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,520
and then I was drinking coffee

325
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,160
and I'm like, lightning moment,

326
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
I know how to make it even better.

327
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,400
And I went back

328
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,880
and split one of the slides,

329
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,640
moved something around,

330
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,480
and cracked it all open.

331
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,360
So it's really fun, intense,

332
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,280
I mean ...

333
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,040
but we get things done, and usually

334
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,240
they leave after two hours

335
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,640
with a fully scripted deck.

336
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,560
Two hours. So, you know

337
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,280
people work for weeks

338
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,800
on slide decks and presentations,

339
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,880
iterating, getting feedback

340
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,640
from so many different people.

341
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,160
Sometimes, these are

342
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,200
the make or break moments

343
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,960
for the company, right?

344
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,480
If I'm taking my slide deck,

345
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,400
and I have an opportunity

346
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,880
to pitch in front of a top tier VC,

347
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,760
this is pretty much

348
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,840
my moment of glory, right?

349
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,800
Not just for the startup,

350
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,160
but also as me as a founder

351
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,560
this is a chance to position ourselves.

352
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,480
How do you get this done in two hours?

353
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,840
Because you're not necessarily

354
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,960
an expert in their field.

355
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,020
You don't necessarily know

356
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,440
these people personally.

357
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,560
I don't come from a technical background,

358
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,680
I don't come from a business,

359
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,240
a finance background.

360
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,360
I told you what my masters is in.

361
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,560
But I am able at the same time

362
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,280
to have a conversation between them

363
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,400
and whoever they're pitching to,

364
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,320
whether it's an investor

365
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,720
or potential customer,

366
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,000
think of all of the questions

367
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,040
the other side would have.

368
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,040
All of the objections,

369
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,160
and our goal is to bring those up

370
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,400
and to mount them as we tell the story,

371
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,600
as we go through the message so that

372
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,680
they're not sitting there thinking,

373
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,880
... they're sitting there thinking ...

374
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,720
So, we really want to engage them

375
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,800
and answer their questions,

376
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
which really is what

377
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
storytelling is all about.

378
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,440
It's about engaging the other side

379
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,120
and what's important to them.

380
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,720
So, yeah.

381
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,960
That makes sense.

382
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,240
I don't know what it is,

383
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,440
that's just my superpower

384
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
to be able to chameleon myself in.

385
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,680
And I always say to them,

386
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,960
If I can tell your story, anybody can.

387
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,880
I'm the benchmark

388
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,800
of every man or every woman

389
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,240
that I'm gonna be

390
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,160
the lowest common denominator

391
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,560
you'd be speaking to.

392
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,040
And if I get it, they'll get it,

393
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,360
especially if they're from your field

394
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,680
or they have a deep understanding

395
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,000
of your field.

396
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,360
And what is the feedback loop?

397
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,160
So, you send them off,

398
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,600
they take the slide deck,

399
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,200
do they come back, update?

400
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,400
Sometimes they'll come back,

401
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,080
they'll send it to me for review,

402
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,320
and then sometimes they'll come back.

403
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,440
Like if they did the investor deck,

404
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,040
they'll raise,

405
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,240
and then we'll do the sales deck

406
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,640
or their website.

407
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,480
What's great is

408
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,080
once we've cracked the DNA

409
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,840
of their story in one deliverable,

410
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,920
they're able to then translate it

411
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,360
and weave it into others.

412
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,880
Right.

413
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,440
It's like their basis.

414
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,280
I call it the infrastructural messaging.

415
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,040
It's the things that's

416
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,560
gonna take them forward

417
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,440
5, 10 years.

418
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,880
It's the basis of their language,

419
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,360
which will evolve and change.

420
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,080
I mean, I worked with JFrog

421
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,040
when they were just a tadpole,

422
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,520
and now they're about to go public.

423
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,800
And they hired me after I coached them

424
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,240
... two-minute pitch session,

425
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,360
and nobody could understand

426
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,040
what the heck they were doing.

427
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,120
And they came to me afterwards

428
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
and they're like,

429
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,360
"Yeah, I think we your help"

430
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
So, we worked on their sales desk

431
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
and their pitch deck and they raised

432
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,960
their first four mil after that.

433
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,000
And it's so exciting to see

434
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,520
because they were true visionaries,

435
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,960
they were way ahead of the curve,

436
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,640
and nobody was getting it yet.

437
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,120
It's kind of like a lot of

438
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,160
the blockchain applications are now

439
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,280
and looking at data in blockchain.

440
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,680
Back then it was all big data

441
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,040
and continuous delivery,

442
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,680
nobody got it.

443
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,080
So, it's being able to help them

444
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,480
see into the future and understand

445
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,200
that this is gonna be a big thing.

446
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,960
That's a huge piece,

447
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,520
like we were talking about before, vision.

448
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,000
Of course. So, you've got to see

449
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,560
over the past years

450
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,640
the industry of storytelling.

451
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,160
And this is a very unique perspective,

452
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,920
I think, because as an entrepreneur

453
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,960
or as an executive,

454
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,920
you really get to see one story unfold

455
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,640
over and over

456
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,280
in front of different people

457
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,000
over a life cycle.

458
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,440
You get to

459
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,320
see thousands of different stories

460
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,680
unfold at different stages

461
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,560
across years.

462
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,160
Has the industry changed at all?

463
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,760
Are the expectations different

464
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,720
about storytelling

465
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,950
from, let's say, 10 years ago?

466
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,840
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

467
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,040
I mean, 10 years ago or 11 years ago

468
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,680
is when I pivoted

469
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,920
to working with startups,

470
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,800
and we were at a high trajectory

471
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,200
of a crisis, of a recession, where

472
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,520
how you told your story mattered more.

473
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,000
Here we are once again

474
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,320
at that kind of trajectory

475
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,960
where investors are investing,

476
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,080
but they're gonna invest

477
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,280
in whoever they think is gonna make

478
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,960
the best return for them at this time,

479
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,760
and you need to be able

480
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,840
to tell a good enough story

481
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,720
of why you why now.

482
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,200
I call that the silver bullet slide.

483
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,880
It has to be about why, the urgency,

484
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,840
get them to see

485
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,320
that this is something now.

486
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,080
So, I have a workshop that I give

487
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,480
on finding the villain,

488
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,480
the bad guy in your audience ...

489
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,680
whether it's economic turn down

490
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,400
or security vulnerabilities

491
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,240
or waste in the system.

492
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,160
That was a list I made

493
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,880
in about 2009, 2010.

494
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,040
I've now updated it

495
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,040
to look at the pain points

496
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,760
that have arisen. All of a sudden

497
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,760
overnight we were thrust into

498
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,640
a completely new reality

499
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,000
with completely new needs.

500
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,400
I mean, the fact that in the US

501
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,400
you couldn't get masks

502
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,360
and toilet paper and things

503
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,040
at the beginning is mind boggling.

504
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,360
So, something has to be done

505
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,920
with supply chain.

506
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,480
Kids are learning from home

507
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,520
and they're learning through

508
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,000
a medium like this, which is great,

509
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,520
but it's not very engaging.

510
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,760
I have a seven year old.

511
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,360
She's sitting in front of Zoom all day.

512
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,520
The teachers are doing

513
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,240
the best they can to engage them.

514
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,720
So, that's another part

515
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,400
that I'm gonna see

516
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,480
I see a lot of disruption.

517
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,960
So, smart investors

518
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,120
and smart entrepreneurs

519
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,440
know how to look at

520
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,000
where things are going and pivot.

521
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,280
And I've seen some amazing companies

522
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,520
pivot right away

523
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,640
when this whole thing started

524
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,760
and do extremely well.

525
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,000
Like see what's happening and then,

526
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,680
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

527
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,520
Move fast.

528
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,640
So, covid hits.

529
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,560
You mentioned that you looked back at 2008,

530
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,080
a recession that you went through,

531
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,880
and now you've managed

532
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,320
to make some changes

533
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,800
in order to accelerate your business

534
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,360
in a time when you don't even

535
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,520
get to meet face to face

536
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,760
with those that you're helping

537
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,400
tell their story.

538
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,360
And to me it sounds so,

539
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,600
there's so much humanity

540
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,560
and so much personality in storytelling.

541
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,720
And I'm sure that when you're sitting

542
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,240
in a room with somebody

543
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,040
this energy and this chemistry,

544
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,240
it's part of the process, right,

545
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,440
of understanding each other.

546
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
And yet you managed

547
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,000
to even accelerate your business.

548
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,560
Tell me about that.

549
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,600
Well lucky for me,

550
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,640
I've been doing Zoom meetings like this

551
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,880
for many years.

552
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,280
I was already a happy paying

553
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,000
Zoom customer before covid hit.

554
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,520
So, I'm happy to have contributed

555
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,120
to their big 167% growth

556
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,920
over the past few months,

557
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,680
but I was already there before.

558
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,000
No, I'm not a stakeholder.

559
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,680
But what happened March 14,

560
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,200
starting to feel like

561
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,480
the bleep is hitting the fan,

562
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,560
emails from my girls' schools were closing.

563
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,480
We were living in an apartment complex,

564
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,520
they closed all shared spaces.

565
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,720
Clients canceling meetings

566
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,040
saying they couldn't pay for work

567
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,800
that was already done

568
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,400
like all at once.

569
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,760
And I was totally thrust back to 2008

570
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,640
when that was happening

571
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,880
at the same time.

572
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,680
And I was like,

573
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,000
"Okay, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?"

574
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,920
Of course, the first emotion

575
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,960
naturally is fear

576
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,800
and you can't breathe.

577
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,480
And then I was like,

578
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,960
"Okay, where's my 2008 playbook."

579
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,840
I grabbed it from the attic,

580
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,120
dusted it off, and I was like,

581
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,800
"Okay, what can I learn from there?"

582
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,280
That was the point where I pivoted

583
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,280
to working with startups,

584
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,240
because enterprise was crumbling

585
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
and startups had a need.

586
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,720
And of course,

587
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,200
all the lovely voices of people saying,

588
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,360
"Startups?

589
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,000
Nobody's gonna pay you for that."

590
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,360
...

591
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,400
So I mean, I was actually,

592
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,280
... one of those serendipitous moments

593
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,120
where I was introduced

594
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,840
to a cardiothoracic surgeon

595
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,880
who needed help

596
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,040
with his professional speeches,

597
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,200
but also had two medical devices

598
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,680
that he needed pitches for.

599
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,840
And that was my first foray

600
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,320
into the world.

601
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,480
And I actually went

602
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,640
and presented on his behalf

603
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,360
for a Big Angel conference,

604
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,240
saw the other startups

605
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,760
that were invited pitch,

606
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,360
and my heart just broke and I'm like,

607
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,520
"Someone needs to help them."

608
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,000
That was my moment of ...

609
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,800
I was actually the first person in Israel

610
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,760
to coin the phrase

611
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,120
storytelling for business or for startups.

612
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,920
And, not in the world.

613
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,200
And then, I was like,

614
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,560
"Okay, what do people need now?

615
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,400
What do they need

616
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,360
in the here and now?"

617
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,920
And I thought, okay,

618
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,720
we're all gonna be working from home.

619
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,640
People need remote presentation training,

620
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,760
because people don't know

621
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,680
how to present, they are awful.

622
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,880
So, I took out a presentation,

623
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,440
a workshop that I gave back in 2003

624
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,000
before we even had video conferences.

625
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,840
Reworked it, added a layer of Zoom,

626
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,840
and started marketing it.

627
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,320
The other thing ... I'm like

628
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,240
startups are gonna be

629
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,000
freaking out now.

630
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,440
So, I took one of my workshops

631
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,520
and broadened it and called it

632
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,360
"Fundraising For Uncertain Times"

633
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:39,800
Amazing.

634
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,360
So those two things, pushing it out,

635
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,480
creating visibility,

636
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,480
creating partnerships,

637
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,640
trying everything.

638
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,760
And in Hebrew we have the expression:

639
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,280
throw your bread out on the water.

640
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,400
Yup.

641
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,000
You never know who's gonna nibble.

642
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,560
Right.

643
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,100
And that's just what happened.

644
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,120
People nibbled. Amazing.

645
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,600
Donna, I have to say,

646
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,520
I mean it's amazing to me

647
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,080
how people work so hard

648
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,520
on such amazing technologies

649
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,560
for so long.

650
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,960
And sometimes it boils down

651
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,720
to a few minutes,

652
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,600
it boils down to a two-minute pitch

653
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,640
or a five-minute pitch

654
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,400
or even an hour pitch.

655
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,880
And you're trying to sum up

656
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,120
a work of years

657
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,600
in a 10-minute presentation.

658
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,520
And at the end, it's almost, I think,

659
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,480
an analogy to people go to the gym

660
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,360
three times a week, four times a week

661
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,000
to work on their body so much.

662
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,600
People don't really put too much effort,

663
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,120
most of the time, on their minds

664
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,440
and training their minds,

665
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,960
whether it be better sleep quality,

666
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,040
better food, psychology, whatever.

667
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,360
And I think it's a similar thing here, and

668
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,440
I think that the work that you're doing

669
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,360
is just so incredible

670
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,080
and I can't wait to work with you as well

671
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,080
when I have my own startup

672
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,920
and my own projects.

673
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,040
But before we leave,

674
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
I want to thank you for being

675
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,680
so generous with your time.

676
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,000
I need three words that you would use

677
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,120
to describe yourself.

678
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,160
Okay. So, optimist.

679
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,720
My motto for life is Winston Churchill.

680
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
Of course, I'm an optimist.

681
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,800
I don't see much point

682
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,800
in being anything else.

683
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,800
A get thing doner.

684
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,920
Getting s**t done.

685
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
Getting s**t done.

686
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,520
That's the closest word I can find.

687
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,480
I am on it.

688
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
I love it.

689
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,920
No moss grows under my feet.

690
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,320
If I don't do it on the spot,

691
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,120
I feel like I'll never get it done.

692
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,640
And I'm a really good friend.

693
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,720
I'm a really good friend

694
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,480
and a really good spouse

695
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
and daughter. I mean

696
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,240
I'm very devoted to the people

697
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,440
that I care about in my life.

698
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,120
I love that.

699
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,200
Donna, toda raba.

700
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,360
Thank you very, very much.

701
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,640
This was just wonderful.

702
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,320
Have a great holiday weekend.

703
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,680
Take care.

704
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,500
Bye, Michael.
