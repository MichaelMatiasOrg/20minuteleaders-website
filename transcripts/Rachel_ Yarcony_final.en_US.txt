1 Five years from now, each one of us is going to get a food that is relevant on his personal biomarkers, it might be DNA, it might be physiological data that you derived from smartwatches, wearables, like sleeping quality, HRV, a body battery, etc. Rachel, thank you for joining me. How are you? Wonderful. Thank you so much. Where are you calling from right now? So currently, I'm in Tel Aviv, the best city in the world. But, you know, we are spread over in New York, California, and Tel Aviv. All over the places. Definitely. With Zoom, it's so easy. Definitely. So, you know, right now you're running myAir in the food tech industry. But you have such a vast experience with food tech. Vice president at Teva, but also experience with Strauss and with Nestlé and so many other companies. So, what I was asking was tell me a little bit about your journey into food tech and why that industry. And what is so exciting to you about food technology? Well, actually, 20 years ago when I started my own journey at the food industry, it was working for Nestlé in Brazil. I did some consultancy projects after my MBA in France. And I discovered the world of food and fell in love immediately. But back then, you know, our KPIs were more about taking out all the baddies. You know, we were talking about quality instead of quantity and talking about taking out all the baddies like oil, salt, sugar. And when I worked for Nestlé, for example, I had these KPIs from the snacks. So, I needed to make some healthier snacks. That was actually the first generation of food. The second generation of food was more about functional food. Food that works for me, food that really brings me values and that was the probiotic words. For example, we have Activia, Actimel, the known product is a very good example for probiotics. And we now are very familiar with all the protein bars. Right. RX revolution. Instead of using powders, just eat it and that's it. But that was the second generation of food. The third generation of food is actually a personal food that works for me. And we call it in myAir, food for mood. And the consumers are so smart and they understand that each one of us is different and one size does not fit all. So, each one of us deserve a different and precise solution for his own body. And this is what we are working on at myAir food tech. Food for moods, which based on personalized nutrition. So, I'd love to talk about about myAir a lot. But first, I want to really understand the industry better and some of the earned secrets and insights that you've gained over working at those various companies. So, what can you teach me about the food space in general, whether it's the innovation side of it, the marketing, the product side of it, what insights have you gained over the years dealing with food and consumers as a product? Maybe it's funny, you know, but my main insights about food came when I worked for pharmaceuticals. You know, I was VP at Teva Pharmaceuticals, the leading generic pharma company. And I understood that opioids and drugs are not a good solution. And that we are what we eat. And good health start with what we eat. And, you know, if another part of the world already understood that plants could be the best medicine and you know that our body is a very intelligent creature, and if you give it the right fuel, it can heal itself. You just need to be cautious to understand your body and to give it to the right fuel, which is your food. So, what we understood that plants could be that right fuel because super plants are the first technology of the world. Right. I've been hearing about these super foods for forever. Yeah. So, you know, you say forever because maybe you are very educated. But most of us, you know, started with eating this junk food. This is what I grew on. And now, we can understand that we can be more precise and learn from plants and how they deal with nature. And the very, you know, new trend in super plants is adaptogens. Adaptogens come from the word to adapt to your environment. Adaptogens are the way that plants adapt to their environment and heal themselves. And the most famous of the adaptogen in the world is caffeine. We drink it, we think that it's a nice flavor, but that's not enough. Caffeine actually relates to our cognitive system and affect our focus or [--]. So, what we are doing at myAir, we actually crafted and researched formulations of different adaptogens coming from super plants, and each different formulations created different effect on our mood. Okay. So, tell me a little bit about this industry of super foods, foods for moods. What's been happening over the past years in terms of consumer behavior? Because you mentioned that you had different generations of food tech and innovation ranging from, you know, the simple foods that we're used to eating to then getting a little bit more personalized with super foods, and now basically people can know what foods are good for them. And we have companies like DayTwo 23andMe that are giving us insights into really our genealogy and what foods will have, what effect will have on our body. So, what's happening today in 2020 and what are some interesting trends that you're observing? So, actually what is happening is people understand that they shouldn't take drugs, they should take less drugs. And you know, transmit themselves to healthier food and functional foods that is precise to their own body. So, that category of food actually is leading on a huge trend, which is big data. You know that professor Yuval Noah Harari is talking a lot about the three generations of consumer decision making. Right. They start with religious. So, it was easy for us to take a decision by the priest or the rabbi that helped us to choose and then moved forward to capitalism. So, we thought that we have, you know, all the options. And now, all of our consumer, decision making processes are based on big data. So, AI actually leverages our decision making. And if we think that we choose a book, for example, it's not so true because maybe the book is choosing us. When I read the Audible, Audible read me as well. So, if you compare that to the food industry, this is actually what is going to happen to us. And five years from now, each one of us is going to get a food that is relevant on his personal biomarkers. It might be DNA, it might be physiological data that you derived from smartwatches, wearables, like sleeping quality, HRV, a body battery, etc. And of course, the psychological parameters. Right. So, actually we are combining all that data, we leverage AI in order to take decision about everything. And this is the future of food tech and this is what we are doing at myAir. But we are actually focusing on a very, very big unmet need. And if you will look around you, you will see that most of your colleagues, friends, family probably are suffering from chronic stress. You know that before covid, the World Health Organization declared that stress is the chronic silent killer. It's the epidemic for our era. And then arrived the very small other epidemic. But stress levels just went you know, higher and higher since the covid. And what we understood is that we can empower the millions to control their stress through personalized nutrition. Because stress, chronic stress is something that you should manage as if it was your dietary routine or your sports routine. So, actually, we leverage the next trend of the food industry with a very big unmet need. That makes a lot of sense. So, tell me a little bit about myAir. What is some of the thought process that went into that? Because before myAir, you were acting as vice president and executive at all these fantastic companies and you decided to venture out into a company of your own. And I love understanding that shift in mindset and that journey that you take on you with you. Yeah. So, my journey is, as you mentioned, started from being a corporate girl, for the last 20 years. I had a stressful career as VP marketing at Teva, the leading generic pharma company. And as CEO at this next division at Nestlé, the leading food corporate. And as a business leader and executive manager, and mother and a caregiver to my parents, stress has become a massive burden in my life. And I tried to manage my stress through meditation and mindfulness. But I failed to maintain a stress less routine. Until I understood that there is one thing that we all love to do which is eating, of course. You know that it's really difficult to change behavior when there is a friction. When you try to do something that is not part of your routine. But when you combine it into the regular stuff that you love to do, like eating, it becomes easy. So, myAir is actually a smart food company. We develop a functional plant-based nutrition bars, I can show you in a second, made with super plants based on research. Everything is patented at research based and they're proven to reduce stress. We leverage big data to tailor them to the consumer stress effect. So, imagine that once a month you get these box into your doorstep and in the box you're going to find nutrition bar that are relevant to your own stress. So, let's say, you know, stress has many faces, and each one of us deserve his own solution. So, we conducted a research with Garmin Health and we understood that each one of us has two main stress effects that are relevant to him. So, for me, stress affects me mainly at night, on my sleep and in the morning, on my focus. So, those are the bars that I need to eat. Okay, and how do you identify that? How do you identify the things that you want to improve on? Yes. So, we developed an algorithm with Professor Daniela Kaufer from Berkeley. She's the dean of the biological faculty and a stress researcher within the last 20 years. And we actually leverage big data from physiological markers and psychological markers. Because stress is a condition of mind and body. So, the physiological data, we take from a smartwatch. Do you have a smartwatch like Garmin or Apple Watch, something like that? Yeah. It's all because you came from California. Right? Early adaptor, [--] leader, you're my target audience. Amazing. I'm ready to buy. Yeah. So you can go to our website, go to myAir.ai, do the cognitive assessment. That's the beginning of the journey. It's only the first assessment. And then, we create this engagement relationship that you keep answer, we take the data and we understand what kind of bars makes you need to eat and how you can control your stress. Very, very cool. So, walk me through some of the process that I would go as a consumer if I were to want to take part in myAir. And I would then love to transition also the conversation to some of the future, of what the future holds for us in food tech in general as well. Sure. So, the journey is very easy. I can assume, you know, that like most of us, 75% of the population suffer from chronic stress. And you go to a website, myAir.ai, and you fill up this very short questionnaire, the test yourself part. And after a few minutes you're going to discover what are the main two stress effects that are relevant to you. Everything is research based, patented and based on a profound clinical research that we conducted with the Garmin Health. So, you are going to discover your solution, your personal solution, and then you are going to order and then you are going to get the box and your personal table of usage. We have consumers that need to eat one bar in the morning for focus or energy or calm and one bar in the evening for mass attention or forgetting to sleep or to have a deeper quality of sleep. We have users that didn't need just only one bar or one bar per two days, or something else. So, everybody gain his own personal solution. And then we invite you to connect your wearable in order to gain more insights that are based on physiological data. And the algorithm is actually working all the time and you know, learning never ends. So, the big data is actually keep moving on and keep helping us to get the best personal box of super plants for each consumer. That's so interesting. So, where is this whole thing headed? So, it makes perfect sense to me that things are becoming more personalized and we want both take ownership over what we put into our body. I just met a fascinating startup called Feto, which does personalized capsules for shaker's for workout's for whatever we want. So, there's a lot of really interesting, very really great. But there's a lot of interesting and innovative things happening in the space. And I'm really curious about what is our food experience is going to be like, let's say in five, ten years? What are some of the big, big shifts that you are anticipating in this industry? So first, the biggest chip, I think it's going to be in the area of replacing our drugs with super plants. As long as we will move and keep, you know, growing the trend of natural ingredients, and this is a huge trend, you know, moving to plants, to vegan and move into clean label, understand that all these artificial ingredients are really, really bad for our body. And this is going just to be bigger and bigger and even covid helped us you know, to push that. Another big trend in food industry is e-commerce. You know that in covid, we actually gained a decades in weeks of progress. And e-commerce and food boomed from 11% to 30% in six months which is unheard of. So, the e-commerce is going to help us all in the food industry to gain more personalization. Because all the big food corporates are looking for the best way to meet their consumer and to understand him better. You know that the future of health is digital health, is prevention. Each one of us is going to be connected to his doctor with a device to, you know, send his own private file to the doctor and gain his own personal solution on time, on demand and even with preventing. So, the food is going to help us through that and going to be a more precise and based on your own body physiological needs. And so, as I mentioned before, the third generation of food industry is functional and personalized and plant based. That's very, very cool. And I have to say that I completely agree with what's going on. I think that what's interesting for me is I do a lot of research on food tech and I'm very conscious as well as what I put into my body. And I think that a lot of my generation is also similar in that regard. And obviously we know the integration of all the tools that we're early adaptors of, it makes perfect sense, we're also early adopters of this mindset. And that's besides the fact that I think that supermarkets, especially in Tel Aviv and Palo Alto are filled with super foods and personalized things for us. What are the side effects of all of this? So, obviously, myAirs side effect hopefully is a population that has less chronic stress. What are other side effects that we can presume regarding the innovation in food? So, myAir is, you know, focusing on one huge unmet need, which is chronic stress, but food can help us you know, with dealing with other mood conditions as well. And food for mood industry is something that is now, you know, only starting. But all the big corporates are investigating that area deeply. And I'm sure that in the future, we are going to choose good food and plants as a source of cognitive effects as well, because our body has the right receptors. And if we just open them and touch them so our body can react to that and our cognitive system is built for that. So, we are what we eat is not just a sentence, it's truly strong belief. And I understand as I, you know, how all the big corporates work that the wave is going to be huge. I completely agree. I think that's inspiring. And Rachel, I want to thank you for being so kind with your time, so generous with your time. It's been very, very insightful. And I just love what you're doing with myAir, and I'm honestly going to have to try that for myself because I just love food tech and I love the integration of artificial intelligence, the technology with our everyday things, especially things that we put into our body. So, I'm very excited to check it out for myself. But before we leave, I have to ask you the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. Well, I think it would be with passion to dare and to win. Wow. I love that. Rachel, thank you very, very much. Stay safe. Stay healthy Thank you so much. It's been great meeting you. And I hope, you know, we will have the chance to meet face to face as well. Definitely. Take care.
