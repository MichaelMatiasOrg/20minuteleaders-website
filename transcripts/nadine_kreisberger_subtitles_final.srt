1
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,040
Nadine, thank you so much for joining
on 20 minute leaders

2
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,800
and so nice of you to give me this time

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,640
know you're a very,
very busy, so thank you

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,120
very, very happy to be with you
wonderful

5
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,040
so Nadine, you know, I've
done quite a few of these so far

6
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,680
with really extraordinary people
that I'm inspired by each one

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,920
I don't think they came across such
a non-linear career path as yours

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,480
from working with a leading
politician in Mongolia to Shaman,

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,600
which you're gonna explain to me what that
is it to a classical music in New York

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,800
and, you know, I can't
even wrap my mind around

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,360
can you please just give me a very
somehow

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,640
brief and short about what you've done and
what motivates you in doing these things?

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,080
yes

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,360
so basically,

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,360
there is a Danish philosopher,
Kierkegaard, who said that when you look

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,320
back at your life,
everything makes a lot of sense

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,360
the only thing is you have
to live it forward, you know

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,120
so at least for everything

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,200
quite a paradox
yeah

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,080
so for everything I've lived till now,
I can actually give you the logic

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,960
I can give you two types of logic

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,120
one is very simple

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,320
I've always tried to be authentic

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:42,640
I've always tried to hear what is it to be
me right now and to be aligned with it,

25
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,480
you know,
and so the answers to that question have

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,960
led me to different parts of the world,
to different types of

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,760
professions and experiences and
apprenticeships and so on and so forth

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,160
what does it mean being authentic?

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,760
I need to get to the bottom of that first

30
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,040
yeah,

31
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,880
there are so many ways of looking at it,

32
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,280
but it's kind of a it's an instinct
that you have inside of you that

33
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,200
when you feel like your your
being true to yourself

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,360
a feeling that I'm walking
the path that I ought to walk

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,880
and it's because it feels right to me

36
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,760
and not because someone else has said
that it's great, not because I'm trying

37
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,480
to please someone else,
not because I'm trying to,

38
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,400
you know, go after some addiction of power
or money or any kind of success,

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,960
which are all external things,
bottomless pits, which in any case have

40
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,600
never made anybody happy
for more than a few moments

41
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,120
so I'm going to try to not be
after those external things

42
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,840
but that feeling inside, when you feel,
you know, it's kind of vertical

43
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,720
you feel good
you feel inside

44
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,680
yeah, that feels right
ok

45
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,440
now Nadine
this is perfect because I am

46
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,760
I'm right at the

47
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,560
the age group where I'm

48
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,960
at the intersection of making career
decisions, I'm choosing a major in college

49
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,160
or I'm applying to different units in the
ADF or choosing internships and jobs

50
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,560
and we have these external forces

51
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,160
I feel that I'm I'm

52
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,640
fortunate to be able to go on a path
that and my parents are supporting me

53
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,240
and saying whatever you feel is
right to you go

54
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,440
but I'm seeing so many people around me
that are struggling with this dissonance

55
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,360
how can it even how can you even expect

56
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,200
people at least my age
to be able to go through that

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,200
inner path piece and not
succumb to the other pressures?

58
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,680
yeah, it starts with self-awareness

59
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,400
it starts with inner curiosity

60
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,800
you know,

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
basically, I started my true
true journey maybe let me tell you a

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,120
few words about my journey
and then I can answer your question really

63
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,720
so I grew-up in Paris,

64
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,000
which is such a privilege,

65
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,920
because you get exposed to so much
culture and intellect and richness

66
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,920
and I was a true product of the
french excellence educational system

67
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,120
I went to the equivalent

68
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:04,800
of the Ivy Leagues of high school,
prep school, business school, all of it

69
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,720
but I had something inside of me always
telling me you can't go

70
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,920
into the conventional
past like you're gonna die

71
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,160
it's my own instinct
you know, it's my own instinct of knowing

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,320
yeah
what is not you already

73
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,520
that's a good start, right?
yeah

74
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,480
and one day

75
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,800
one night I didn't sleep

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,640
and it just like I put everything together

77
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,080
and I was like, yeah,
I'm going to New York

78
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,240
I'm going to work in publishing
because I love history

79
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,760
I also studied history

80
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,960
New York is a free place where
you can discover who you are

81
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,880
you can explore
nobody cares

82
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,480
Ok a big shift, right

83
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,280
so that was my first one

84
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,920
and then, of course, then life happens
and it's not exactly what you think

85
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,000
and so that's what your question is like

86
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,320
I always believe,
like, you don't do destiny

87
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,880
you show up, you do your homework,
and destiny does destiny

88
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,440
you know, like you meet certain people
in ways that you could never plan

89
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,720
like you have all those sorts
of things like that

90
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,160
then direct you and I ended up moving
on and developing within a classical music

91
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,840
company,
which was back then the biggest portal

92
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,800
online for classical music
and also a record label

93
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,560
and I was 24 and I
was probably, wait wait wait,

94
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,200
so you got you went you came
to New York to do publishing and

95
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,400
yeah
and then at 24 my age

96
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,880
and then you

97
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,480
came to found the world's most popular
classical music portal online

98
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,800
yeah
ok

99
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,560
that's what I mean
you don't do destiny

100
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,400
you show up, do homework

101
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,680
you work hard

102
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,520
and there are all those things
that you cannot control of encounters

103
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,160
like I met this amazing man who was
also the lawyer for Ifsa Rohan

104
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,560
you know, the fashion designer
and was with them that we did that

105
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,320
and so
and I

106
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,720
went around the world and I was
supposed to so much and I learned so much

107
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,160
but in parallel to that,

108
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,400
I had this thing about the inner
curiosity, like I had to understand myself better

109
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,960
and I started that journey in parallel

110
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,320
in parallel

111
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,560
ok and I so I was very curious,

112
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,480
I was driven by that need and I ended up
meeting a number of teachers, you know

113
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,720
so let's call it wisdom schools
you know, people

114
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,440
we're old souls and teach you a lot
of deep things and philosophies

115
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,120
and spiritual is a terry traditions

116
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:35,200
I also ended up in therapy with someone
who had studied with Carl Jung

117
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,360
oh, wow

118
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,680
one of the biggest psychologists of all
time and was also one of

119
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,840
so I spent many years with him and
what her her mentor was Carl Jung

120
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,760
one of Carl Jung's right hands

121
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,200
that's incredible
yeah

122
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,040
and then at some point she thought

123
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,720
that I should take on her legacy,
I should continue her work

124
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,040
so I was also trained in that
woah

125
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,280
and in parallel to that,
I joined a drumming circle where we were

126
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,760
working with shamans
from around the world

127
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,920
and so you're asking,
what are shamans those

128
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,480
so in every single culture on Earth
yeah

129
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,400
before the operation of monotheistic
religions, for instance,

130
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,440
in each village, you know,
there was always a shaman

131
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:25,800
shaman is a word a Tungus word, which is
a tribe in Northern Eastern Siberia
Ok

132
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,240
so every time is not the words,
so it doesn't matter

133
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,960
but it was like someone who could usually
use drum or other things to go

134
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,520
into trance, to go to different
state of consciousness

135
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,640
ok
to access information useful

136
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,320
for the community, whether
the future or to heal and when they do

137
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,120
that through into an intensive
drumming circle or drumming ritual

138
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,600
well, in almost every tradition,
a drum is involved

139
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,240
but sometimes they take stuff, you know,

140
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,040
like ayahuasca you may
have heard ...

141
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,880
I heard about that yeah

142
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,760
after all

143
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,880
but anyway, so I wasn't for the record

144
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,840
I haven't tried it, but I've heard about it

145
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,080
ok

146
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,000
the point is that with drums

147
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,320
just the sound of drum because
it goes like your heartbeat

148
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,680
it kind of tunes down your left brain
and you can access more your right brain

149
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,280
if you want to put it
in those metaphoric terms

150
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,080
very quickly recap, what is the difference

151
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,600
between left and right, remind me
like a more intellectual,

152
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,440
you tone down the intellectual side
and you can more the creative,

153
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,280
craved, intuitive, you know,
like all those other things

154
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,520
wonderful

155
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,600
and that was so you see ahead it was

156
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,120
amazing to work with those shamans

157
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,240
from all those different
traditions and native Americans,

158
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,360
Siberians,
and all this because

159
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,480
they still have a connection to nature,
to the elements, to the wisdom of life

160
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,600
that we're often
lost in the western world

161
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,880
so it was very enriching

162
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,640
so put all those things together

163
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,160
and all those currents have formed me,
you know, and at some point

164
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,200
wow
after six years in New York,

165
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,520
it felt like I was done
and the guidance came in a shamanic

166
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,680
journey that to become
who I'm meant to become

167
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,440
I have to move to Mongolia

168
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,720
and

169
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,640
I had never thought in my life
that I would do that

170
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,680
and it sounded quite insane

171
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,400
but I had this if I can imagine myself
going to my parents and my girlfriend

172
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,400
and saying, guys, you know,
I've been in Palo Alto for a while

173
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,040
I love the startup world

174
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,520
but to be who I really want to be,
I have to go to Mongolia

175
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,400
yeah, exactly

176
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,040
and a part of me was
saying exactly the same

177
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,320
but then there were so many coincidences

178
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,960
and I it was like just
so insane, you know

179
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,440
and it felt like yeah I have to do this

180
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,640
and I started doing a lot of homework and

181
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,920
I ended up in Mongolia thinking,

182
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,080
I'm going to be trained in shamanism or
something, because that's a place where

183
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,400
those traditions are
still very much there

184
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,960
but two days after my arrival,

185
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:01,400
I met this amazing, amazing human being,
Oyuun, who was back then the leading

186
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,000
female politician of the country who was
in college that had just won parliamentary

187
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,760
elections and gradually I
became her right hand

188
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,760
so I was in government

189
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,240
I was seeing how the government works,

190
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,440
the parliament I was working
in the Mongolian parliament

191
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,280
you were working in the
Mongolian parliament, too

192
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,520
and you met her two days after coming

193
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,360
to Mongolia to to be more
equipped with a shaman ritual

194
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,520
exactly
so, you see, that's what life is

195
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,240
you show up, you do your homework

196
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,560
I had done a ton of homework to know
so many people in Mongolia

197
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,360
but I could have never planned

198
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,920
to end up having the Mongolian soldiers
saluting me every morning and every

199
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,520
evening was when I was entering
the main building of the country

200
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,160
Nadine

201
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,440
you have to come to this
to the experiences as open minded, right

202
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
because I'm sure that in the same token

203
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,480
that you had these experiences,
you could have missed them

204
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,240
if you weren't open to accepting
them as another case

205
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,480
exactly
that's what I'm saying

206
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,680
you show up
yeah do your

207
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,760
homework and destiny does destiny

208
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,280
you know, so you're open

209
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,200
but also you look what feels right
what doesn't feel right

210
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,040

I feel its like dialogue between your

211
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,080
intuitions and things
that flow in your life

212
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,840
you know, I think what he called you

213
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,840
called a synchronicities, you know,
when there are weird coincidences

214
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,560
and you're like, wow, I should really
look in that direction, you know

215
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,280
ok, so Nadine just to make
sure that I'm following the track

216
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,840
let's recap

217
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,080
so Paris businesses like business
and Ivy Leagues and everything great

218
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,720
and then you move
to New York for publishing

219
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
but you actually go to create a musical,

220
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,200
a classic music portal, but then you
fall in love with the shaman rituals

221
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,640
so you go to Mongolia to
study that but you actually

222
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,080
and and somewhere in the process,
there where you study with Carl Jung's

223
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,160
right
right hand person and then

224
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,600
you end up leading with a politician

225
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,000
meeting a female politician

226
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,520
I always loved politics

227
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,080
I always I studied
international affairs also

228
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,840
so, you know, you can't
take things literally

229
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,200
shamanism is about accessing information

230
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:05,080
to transform reality and one way to do it is
through politics and development of policy

231
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,480
and I love it
so

232
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,320
so, you know, from that angle,

233
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,400
she said to me all over Asia to represent
her or Mongolia, which was hilarious

234
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,560
I spent time in Siberia, in Central Asia

235
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,880
we were in North Korea,
all sorts of adventures

236
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,480
what did you say about North Korea? we
were official guests for some celebration

237
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,240
you know, it was like not
not inside North Korea

238
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,920
yeah
inside you went inside North Korea

239
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,760
yeah
but back then, a lot of people were

240
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,320
it was a period when they were opening up

241
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,360
well, you're the first person that I
met that got to be inside North Korea

242
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,280
so officially, I got what I what
I wanted from 20 minute leaders

243
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,760
no

244
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:50,240
but, you know, anyway, it was just like
an education and exposure to a lot of

245
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,600
a lot of things

246
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,560
and at the same time,
it's minus 40 in the winter

247
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,480
It's the coldest capital in the world

248
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,440
and at some point, I felt like, listen,
I can't stay for the rest of my life,

249
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,080
you know, trying to give everything
I have to help this country

250
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,760
It felt like something
had to move, you know

251
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,880
and again, I was like, but where next?
no idea

252
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,680
and then in one of the conferences where

253
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,440
Oyuun had sent me, I met a minister
in the Tibetan government in exile

254
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,320
you know, the government
in exile of the Dalai Lama

255
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,240
and he invited me to India

256
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,560
to a teaching of the Dalai Lama

257
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,960
and it just felt right to it with my next
one way ticket, one suitcase

258
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,480
let me go to India

259
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,040
one suitcase

260
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,320
yes

261
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,360
and then in India, again,

262
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,800
the guidance and from one thing
to another, I ended up in New Delhi,

263
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,960
the capital where I did
a couple of things

264
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,280
I actually developed my therapy coaching
practice

265
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,440
and I ended up
doing amazing, amazing, amazing work

266
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,280
it was fascinating

267
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,720
within the Indian culture,
within the Indian society

268
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
what what type of therapy was this?

269
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,720
well, it's
a combination of union, right

270
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,240
yeah

271
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,080
there is energy and spiritual practices
and business leadership strategy stuff

272
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,200
basically, it's one on one coaching,
mentorship, therapy, that combination

273
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,360
yeah, exactly

274
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,560
and I was working with a lot
of fascinating people in politics

275
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,280
and business, and design
and arts and all of this

276
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,040
and in parallel to that,

277
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,760
I had TV shows on national television like
I was doing a morning show

278
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,640
interviewing Indian personalities
on the meaning of life in New Delhi

279
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,200
yeah
I also had a weekly column was

280
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,040
interviewing every week another
personality on the meaning

281
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,440
of spirituality,
which was amazing and super interesting.

282
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,800
and I met amazing people like that

283
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,760
and I felt I mean, I
felt very much at home in India,

284
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:02,400
I resonated a lot with the the spiritual
you breathe spirituality

285
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,040
you breathe a different understanding
of life, which talks to me a lot

286
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,960
and it was just
an absolutely fascinating time

287
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,240
so, wow

288
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,560
and that's a place where I
thought I would always stay

289
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,080
but somehow life guided me differently

290
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,360
why am I not surprised
yeah

291
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,760
but I am in a different phase now

292
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,560
but I'm just giving you a different
apprenticeships I've had

293
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,680
and so I moved to California in 2012

294
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,720
and I mostly focused on my
coaching counselling work

295
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,880
basically, I, call it a joint journey

296
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,880
because it's not
coaching or therapy does it

297
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,120
I don't resonate with those
words so much I call it a joint

298
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,480
journey because it's
really a journey with another person

299
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,040
you know, it's in

300
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,520
with other person where
the tool box is rich you know it can be

301
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,360
depth psychology

302
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,600
it can be working with dreams to help you
understand what's going on inside of you

303
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,720
a lot of trans-generation
work because it

304
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,240
turns out we carry so much baggage
from the generations before us

305
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,200
and if we don't understand that,
we are controlled by that

306
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,280
and that's not a life well
lived authentically, you know

307
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,080
so trans-generation work
combined with the business stuff or

308
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,960
political stuff or media stuff,
and all of this comes into my work

309
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,520
I work one on one with people and then

310
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,560
with their companies when they own
a company, you know it depends

311
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,360
cases I work with people in Europe,
in the US, in India, wow

312
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,480
in Asia and the rest of Asia,
actually in Israel, a couple of people

313
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,520
so I'm mostly focusing on that right now

314
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,840
and

315
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
it feels wonderful

316
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,440
it's like the confluence
of all the streams of my life

317
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,520
yeah, there were some
Hawaii in there

318
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,400
right
if I recall correctly

319
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,880
yes
I wanted to make it short so I

320
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,000
between New York and Mongolia

321
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,920
all the synchronicities were

322
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,400
leading me to the big island of Hawaii,
which is the which has an active volcano

323
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,280
and where I went, you know,
like totally like a reset button

324
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,200
it was like a reset button
of all my Western life

325
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,960
I spent time next to the lava flows
it was

326
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,760
extremely powerful what I went through

327
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,000
at a very, very deep level, and
then it was like, ok, I was ready to go

328
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
how long were you there for?
less than a year

329
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,360
less than six months even
but it was

330
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,520
really, really powerful

331
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,040
ok, Nadine, this is just insane

332
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,640
I'm so sad that we have
about four minutes left

333
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,560
this is ok
you know what

334
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,360
let's make it easy

335
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,400
I'm coming now to you

336
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,120
and I'm looking for some free advice

337
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,240
and I I'd love to know, you know,

338
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,400
you've gone through so many experiences
and so many authentic experiences

339
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,800
I don't want to know how to be successful

340
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,520
I want to know how to be content

341
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,480
so give me and whoever else
would be interested in this

342
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,680
what are some of your earned
secrets after these experiences?

343
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,400
of of what is it mean to really be content
and be authentic in a very tangible way?

344
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,840
what can people do in the 21st century
when we're guided by all these

345
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,000
technologies and all of these, you know,
races to be to climb the ladder of success

346
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,440
at 22 years old?
How can we deal with that?

347
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,680
first of all, just to ask that question is

348
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,960
already it feels to me like a big chunk
of the work, you know,

349
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,520
just to be aware that if
you just race and race and race,

350
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,800
you know, as they often say,
it's like putting the ladder,

351
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,600
climbing the ladder, and then you
realize it's on the wrong wall

352
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,560
First of all, ask the question to me
one way

353
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,080
one easy way to ask that question
is to imagine you're 99 years old

354
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,600
ok
and I ask you,

355
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,360
what is for you?

356
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,120
was it a life well lived?

357
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,760
and you just imagine
was it a life well lived

358
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,960
and can you just imagine
what would it entail

359
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,640
at the age of ninety nine

360
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,840
for you to tell me, yes,
it was a life well lived

361
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,240
can we trust people my age to
have to think to have that

362
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,720
thought
well, that's my second point,

363
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,240
is that the answer to that will
change over time and that's too fine

364
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
the point is, ask the question

365
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,080
try to ask the question,
but ask it again and again, right

366
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,440
It's not asking one time
and that's it

367
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,800
yeah, you don't
have a definitive answer

368
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,120
no definitive answer
this is my second point

369
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,960
keep asking because it changes third
point and life is a mystery

370
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,000
so third point,

371
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,400
the answer to what is a life well lived

372
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,760

is gonna be very different inside of you

373
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,440
if you ask the one who talks about

374
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,440
everything you want to create
or invent as an entrepreneur

375
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,840
everything that you have like it that you

376
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,560
want to do for the world that could
impact your meaning for society

377
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,400
that's one type of answer

378
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,320
if you have a side in you, that's
like a child and just wants to play

379
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,720
if you only work, it's never going
to be a life well live for that side

380
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,680
so can we ask that side too,
third

381
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,920
if we ask the one we knew that might want

382
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,000
to create a family,
for instance, a life well lived the answer

383
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,840
has nothing to do with a guy
who is the entrepreneur inside of you

384
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,640
right,
or if I talk about a lover inside of you

385
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,560
who wants to have a gorgeous chemical
relationship with your partner

386
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,200
do you think it's gonna be the
same answer

387
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,400
as, again, the entrepreneur
or the child or the father

388
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,720
no
you're just complicating things

389
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,880
Nadine, it's just too hard
and give it

390
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,960
it's not hard at all

391
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,840
the point is, if you understand that
inside you

392
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,840
I'll tell you
and that's my my next point

393
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,600
that's where I'm going

394
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,640
that curiosity that I was telling

395
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,840
you about at the beginning to try
to understand yourself better

396
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,240
you have that curiosity about yourself

397
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,840
now, that's what's going
to lead you to authenticity

398
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,000
it's basically, can you take a flashlight

399
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,280
and go inside yourself,
can you discover those different facets

400
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,280
inside of you because they
have different needs

401
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,840
they have different messages for you

402
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,600
they have different fears

403
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,040
you know, they have different
modes of operating

404
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
I love it,
so can you explore that a little bit

405
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,680
and maybe inside of you does a rebel
who doesn't care about any of that

406
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,480
maybe inside of you there's
also an inner critic who's

407
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,840
also trying telling you are not
good enough not good enough, or whatever

408
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,440
there's a hermit who just
wants to explore in the mountains

409
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,520
I have no idea

410
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,880
but can we take a flashlight,
explore that

411
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,040
because if you do that

412
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,560
you get to know yourself a little bit
more

413
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,160
so, by definition, it's more
authentic, the life you need

414
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,440
I love it
you see what I mean

415
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,120

no, no 100 % interesting

416
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,440
but I'm also aware that it has
to be some sort of balance where,

417
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,160
you know, I wouldn't want
my future 14 year old daughter

418
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,040
to come to me and say, daddy,
now I'm dropping out of

419
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,560
of ninth grade because my inner
self says that I should go and

420
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,520
and to do something else,
right

421
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,960
so, I mean, I do
think there should be some balance where

422
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,360
we have a path
that gives us the tools to be

423
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,840
able to think critically and be
successful in whatever we do

424
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,280
and and you obviously did a lot
of that before

425
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,880
you went on to experience.
do you think that's valid or should we

426
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,080
also entertain for much younger
people who feel that way?

427
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,920
actually, for me, though,

428
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,000
so I've developed a tool I called
a round table of inner characters

429
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,000
because I've found that most people have about
ten or twelve of those characters

430
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,880
all of us
ok

431
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,200
but at the head of the table is
lewis round, meaning it's equal

432
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,480
and I want to make sure I
hear from everyone, ok

433
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,240
The doer, the lover, the caretaker
all of them

434
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,680
yup

435
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,480
me at the head of the table
is what I call the wise one

436
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
ok

437
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,720
the wise one is the one who has a
sense of balance, has a sense of

438
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,040
yeah

439
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,240
it's not about quitting everything
and jumping and taking a one way ticket

440
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,960
and one suitcase and going
to the North Pole

441
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,080
you know, that has its limitations

442
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,640
the wise one is gonna find a balance
between certain drives,

443
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,880
certain intuitions, you know,
certain ideas, certain instincts

444
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
and that's the only one

445
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,040
that can actually synthesize all of it
and do something that is actually not

446
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,880
insane that will help
you walk that path for life

447
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,560
well lived
so much inspiration

448
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,240
I just love this talk so much
thank you for the time

449
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:24,000
I have to put you on the spot once
and I know it's not fair

450
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
but I will

451
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,680
I want you to tell me three words
that you would best describe yourself

452
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,480
I usually I say I am an explorer

453
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,640
so definitely, I'm an explorer

454
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,280
that's that's an easy one

455
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,960
a couple of others I have to tell,
you now?

456
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,040
we can do this later,
but I think that everybody would like it

457
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,080
just having gone through
this all these experiences

458
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,360
I mean I mainly interested

459
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,720
what type of personality leads
people to do what they do?

460
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,120
you know, a lot of entrepreneurs
are telling me they're passionate

461
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,440
A lot of CEOs are telling me

462
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,400
that they're empathetic and they're
sensitive to other people, their leaders

463
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,960
a lot of creative people say
that they're artistic and and etc

464
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,680
are obviously an explorer
what else?

465
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,120
what else how else would you characterize

466
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,760
it or how else would your
colleagues characterize you?

467
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,000
well, since I was little, I was

468
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,360
talking to people much, much older
than me about the meaning of life

469
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,600
a philosopher?
so you can say a philosopher or a priestess or

470
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,360
something like that about the seeker
ritual side, you know, a spiritual side 

471
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,080
wanting to go deep, really deep,
as deep as possible

472
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,480
so it's about the wisdom, you know

473
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,120
so that's a very real art to me.

474
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,440
and then,

475
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,680
yeah, the third one,
I'll tell you next time, huh?

476
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,960
that's that
you know, and I think that

477
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,160
it's also amazing how, you know,
sometimes they get answers very quickly,

478
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,080
as if it's rehearsed
and people know it

479
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,080
sometimes it's very it's
very, very difficult

480
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,880
and I think that shows a part of it,

481
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,040
this inquisitiveness and this not being
willing to settle for a definitive

482
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,040
characteristic, but being
constantly under exploration

483
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,280
and I think having only two out

484
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,880
of the three is a part of the journey
that you're on to continue exploring

485
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,040
and I'm learning from that

486
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,600
because I think we truly, truly,
truly are a mystery in so many ways.

487
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,040
I love it
and it keeps unfolding

488
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,320
I love it
Nadine, thank you so much

489
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,920
I really appreciate it
you're welcome
