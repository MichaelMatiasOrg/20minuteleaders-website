All right. Wonderful. Steven Gerbsman, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. My pleasure. Really, really great to have you. With 51 years of experience in crisis management, as an investor, angel investor as well. And really understanding how to maximize the value of enterprises. I'm so excited to learn with you exactly what is crisis management. And I'd love to spend the next 20 minutes getting to know you better and gaining some insight that hopefully one day as a seasoned entrepreneur, I will have to confront a lot of the lessons that you've already learned. So, let's dig in who are you, Stephen? So, let me give you a little brief background. My career started with the IBM Corporation. I was president of four operating divisions of a company called ITEL Corporation in San Francisco, which is in a computer releasee business. And in the 80s and 90s, I was a hands-on crisis turnaround CEO being dropped in by equity or senior lenders. Around 2018, What does that mean? Wait. Stephen, what does that mean an interim CEO crisis turnaround? Let me turn it around. Companies fail and companies succeed for different reasons. And companies fail for three reasons. Lack of control, preservation, and forecasting of cash. Lack of control, preservation, and forecasting of cash. And a lack of control, preservation, and forecasting of cash. It's all about cash. It's all about cash. You have management issues. You get to market issues. You get that gross margin issues. You can have competition. You can have FDA issues. Doesn't matter. If you have enough cash, you can get through the process. And boards of directors or senior lenders focus on what happens in companies. But let me take it to 90 round the 2000 and I'll talk about, because I think this is a threat here. When the Internet blew up, we observed that there were no hard assets. It was intellectual property. You had software, you had medical device, you had life science. You get mobile, you had fuel cell. Later on, you had solar. So, there was a whole new industry that grew up with your normal M&A process. You really wasn't viable. So, we got involved around 2000 with companies that had anywhere between 10 to 200 million dollars invested. Okay. And these companies, again, something happened, but it all revolved around amount out of cash. They were the senior lender companies or they were venture private equity companies. To the extent that what they needed to do was find a way to go forward. So, if the board or the bank decided not to continue to invest, which is all about cash, what happens then? So, you've got to maximize value in relationship to the market. So, we created a process called the Date-Certain M&A Process. Where we go to market in six weeks, we maximize the value of the intellectual property and assets. We've got 109 deals. 109? 109 deals. And to the extent that we were able to get on to save jobs, save intellectual property, Steven, I wanna just summarize to make sure that I understand this correctly. What you're saying is that you have a company. It has investments of historically of 10 to 200 million. Now, we've reached a point where the investors, current or new, are not interested in continuing along. The company is now in a problem because it's running out of cash. It has assets. It has intellectual property. It has value. It has value. But now you're coming in and you're saying, "I want to help you maximize its value." "I'm gonna come in for six weeks in and out." "And I'm gonna maximize the value of the assets you have." "And I'm gonna try to save as much as I can of the value of your company." Right? I'm going to try to save as much as I can for the value for the stakeholders. For the stakeholders. Stakeholders are equity creditors, senior lenders, investors, all of the above. Are employees’ stakeholders? Yeah. I would call employees stakeholders. And when you go forward part of the objective is it's hard for investment banks to do these type of deals. Because they get into what I call M&A nirvana. They get aggressive warranty issues. You can go on forever. You get letters of intent. And that is in the real world. So, we go to customers, competitors, strategic, VCs for their portfolio companies, senior lenders. We're branded worldwide. We just did a deal in Israel. We've got a couple deals in China, Australia, obviously the US. And the message is the board has made a strategic decision. They wanna go forward and try to monetize and maximize value. And why did the board do this? Basically, they have a fiduciary responsibility to all those stakeholders and creditors. Right. And to the extent, part of the challenge is, there has to be enough money in the company to run a process. To pay us, to pay the employees, to keep things going, etc. What's happened over the years after the debacle in '07 to '09 if you will, is that senior lenders who represent probably about 30% of our deals that they're involved in, made sure that they put covenants in and there was enough cash to maintain the operation to go forward. But basically, the board said, "I wanna decide what we do to go forward." "We're not gonna put any more cash in." "We don't want to do a hard shutdown." "We want to meet our fiduciary responsibilities." So, we're an independent third party that's able to go to the market, find out what's going on, and we basically send out a sales letter. All due diligence is done prior to the bid date. We send out an asset purchase agreement. We require a deposit. Highest bid that conforms to the asset purchase agreement wins. Bids come in to me. So, it's a closed process. We've changed the dynamics of power and control. Where the bank is sitting their investment bank and holding the company off to an LOI or whatever one on one. It's anybody can bid. Highest bid wins, and we go back and handle on price and all that stuff at the end. And the company can either accept or reject the deal. Now the perception of value is always in the eyes of the beholder. And value is the market. The market will determine value. Because it isn't what people pay for it. It's what people, what it costs to get to the next step. So, as I said, we've done 109 deals very credible in that market, et cetera. But let me give you some observations, By the way, so, just to make sure I understand. When you come into the picture, it is understood by all parties that this company is going to be either merged or acquired. Is that correct? Well, it is understood that we're going to do an asset sale. Meaning the company without its liabilities. Meaning that the acquirer can decide which people they want. In all cases, the value of the IP and assets or the company without its liabilities is really related to the quality and availability of the key intellectual capital, which is the people. And it really isn't the CEO, really isn't the CFO, it's the IP technology people. The people who really work in these areas that make sense. The VP R&D, those roles are [--] When you invest in a $200 million, half of our deals have been in the medical device life science area. All right. Basically because they bring the most return and they can have a CE mark, which is approval of Europe. They can be in some form of FDA, etc. But I want to take you to one area that you sort of alluded to. When we talk about why companies fail and why companies succeed and young entrepreneurs. The biggest frustration and challenge for myself and my partners, we're all like CEOs, is that the board of directors doesn't hold the CEO responsible and accountable enough. All right. I'm ready for this now. Yeah. All right. So you have venture capital, you have senior lenders, you have private equity. A lot going on, when things are going well. You're the CEO. You're king of the Hill. If you haven't been through a down cycle, you don't know what to do. CEOs will shut down. They won't communicate. We've been in situations where everybody in the company knows what's going on. But the CEOs concerned about communicating that, which is the worst thing you can do. Of course. It's all about leadership, motivation, morale, communicate, communicate, communicate. You tell people the truth and it will free your soul, but make it a lot easier. So, you don't bullshit anybody. How often do CEOs are not completely open with their board? How many of the cases would you think? Well, it isn't a matter of not being open with the board. It's a matter of either the board not forcing issues sooner than later because they see something's happening and they're working on a leap of faith. Or the CEO doesn't communicate. But is this a common thing? Is this a common phenomenon? I would say, here's what's common. What's common is at least 30 to 40% of companies that we get into, the CEOs have not been experienced enough to know what to do in other situations. They've been through it a couple of times. You know, in cases it's a badge of honor if you have a company doesn't make it because you know what's going on, you do the best you can. But the real issue comes down to when you get in crisis mode. You need to communicate to your employees, to the creditors, to your stakeholders that the senior lender, to your vendors, to the market. Okay. And one of the issues that you find if you are important to these people and you're actually delivering product with intellectual property, it's hard for them to go away. So, you get creditors to support you and they want to see something happen. Right. So, when we use the term, maximize the value of the intellectual property and assets, We're trying to find a home that will take it to the next level. Now, here's the waterfall. The waterfall is when we do a deal, then we get paid, lawyers get paid, and management gets paid. But the real people that come after that are the secured creditors, which is the lender. And then you've got the unsecured creditors, which are the creditors, the payables. Equity rarely gets paid off in these deals. But the real, the issue that you're doing is you're meeting your fiduciary. I use that word a number of times. And, if you're gonna ask me about three words, I'm going to give you the three words right now, Ethics, Integrity and Leadership. Okay. You go through life. You don't sell your soul. You tell people the truth. And you get through it. The hardest thing to do when we get involved with my partners and like with any company and in three days, tell you what's going on. And here's the profile. If we sit down and a CEO doesn't let us talk or we have a meeting with the CFO, the CTO, the CMO, all the key executives, and all that CEO does is tell us what's going on. I know we've got a problem. Because the strong CEO is going to say, "CFO, tell me what's happened." "CTO, step in and tell me what's happened" "CMO, tell me what's happening." And you try to work the problem in an open environment. But again, it's not necessarily, it's experience. I mean, how old are you right now? 24. God bless you. You're the future and you give us hope. Thank you very much. Don't run your company in 27. But unless you've never been through it. And that's what I wanna know, Stephen. So, now it's time for some selfish request because I want some advice from you. I'm going to run a company. I'm very excited for that. I hope I get to a point where my company is big enough and strong enough. And know what? I hope that we're going to have to fight some hurdles because I wanna learn and I wanna experience. What do you what do I need to keep in mind from day zero? I don't want to reach a crisis and then ask you, "Stephen come help me." So, what you need to do from day zero is the following, okay? One, you cannot lead if you haven't done. Go make a sales call. Call a vendor. Go down to the manufacturer plan. Meet the people. Understand how to communicate to employees. Close in order. Talk to the senior lender. Force people into a discipline because it's all about respect. But you don't get respect. until you really know what's going on. The other thing is, I told you the three reasons why companies fail, start with putting in a discipline, a bottoms up, go forward cash flow. Not top down. You see all these great spreadsheets. And I look at them when I come in. Too late. It doesn't mean anything for me. I need to understand what we have is cash in the bank and on a weekly basis, what I'm spending, why and how, and what creditors I can push off or not. Because I need to preserve control and forecast cash. Now, you're a healthy company. You just got 10 million bucks. Okay. You're feeling good. Your best business partner is your chief financial officer. He or she, you hold them responsible and accountable. And you need to understand the numbers. Many, many years ago, when I became a division president of one of the groups at ITEL corporation, the CEO came in and said, this is before we had real spreadsheets. "I want you to run your business model with your hand." So, you know everything that's going on, calling employees cost, production cost, cost of goods sold market. You need to know the numbers. So, it goes back to the fact. If you want to lead, you have to do. And if you don't do, you can't lead. So, understand your business. The other thing is it's all about leadership, motivation and morale and how you communicate to people. You're in the business of, you may wanna be liked, but you need to be respected. And people will respect you if you tell them the truth. If you tell them what's going on. If you set reasonable goals. Okay. The other thing is, is you need to learn how to sell up. Meaning if I'm the VP of finance marketing, I'm going to sell up to you about what's going on. I wanna anticipate what's happening. Right. You need to manage your board because your board may not be managing you because they've got 10 other deals going on. Right. Right. So, the first time you get a glitch, I need help. It takes a strong person to say, "I need help." What do I do? What do you think? Nobody's gonna question your ability. I mean, after the third time you do it, I may fire you. But the first and second time, I'm gonna give you enough rope. Sure. Sure. So, I mean, it sounds to me that it all comes back then to integrity and honesty and being open and allowing myself to hold myself accountable, but also allowing others to hold me accountable. But it sounds like unless you've gone through these crises yourself, it's really, really hard to empathize with them and to really understand. Because I can see in the future, three years down the line, I go to my board meeting and something doesn't work exactly like I think, a board meeting is an hour long. We do it once a month. I'm gonna come in and I have nine other incredible things I wanna say that are just gonna help me get my next round of investments and gonna get me the next high five. It's gonna take a lot of social a lot of personal responsibility to get to see that one thing that's not so nice. Right? Look, I said, it's about ethics, integrity and leadership. Those are the three words you want me to end with. I'm beginning with it. I'm the middle, I'm gonna end with those same words. I love it. It's your responsibility to understand how to sell and communicate. Okay? Now, because you're the young entrepreneur, you're going to screw up a couple of times. You have to. But let me go back to the fact, if you haven't done, you can't lead. So, if you don't know the financial numbers or you don't know your gross margin or you don't know the architecture, resale or the lead time to sell, lead time to install, lead time to close the sale, lead time to get cash. What your AR is 30 days, 45 days. What's going on in payables. What's going down on the manufacturing floor. You're in trouble. All right. So, in good times, everybody's having a ball. Okay? And I've lived through now, '87 to '89, '94 to '95, '01 to '03, '07 to '10. '12 to '14. You know, this is different. 2020. Why is this different? Why is this different? Because it's the magnitude where people are frozen and they don't know what to do. Meaning I have five proposals out there right now. I get calls from banks and equity. And everybody has a leap of faith. Hope that they shouldn't. You have to, I've always learned that we're the last ones in and everybody has that hope. And you just play it out and you bleed some more. This cycle is very emotional. And you sit here, three months ago, my partners and I discussed the travel business, the entertainment business, the market coming back. There's no way. I went out two and a half months later, everybody thought it'd be great. No way it's gonna happen. It's gonna take a lot longer. So, I encouraged people to make all the hard decisions now. And I'll give you a different example. Example is, you have a prohibitive real estate lease. You're a company that's doing revenue. And you have, and this is an actual company, has 50 million bucks in the bank. They're burning 10 million bucks a month. They are gonna downsize, but they have a contingent liability of a real estate lease. We've terminated and restructured about $800 million of these problem real estate leases. $800 million. Wow. What we tell people to do is don't pay the rent. Okay. Call back the landlord and say, "Hey, we need some help here." And to the extent that when we do this stuff we've got to work something out. The landlord is going to say, "No. Pay the rent." "And I'm gonna have my lawyer call you." "I'll give you the fall." And you're going to say, "I'm not gonna pay." And that's going to cause the landlord to do something. Starts spending money on lawyers, creating havoc, etc. And you're gonna sit there and say, "We've got to negotiate." Now where we were in '04 to '06, this is the same timeline. And I'll tell you, the ultimate reason why you do this is that it took 18 months to get before the courts stand. Basically, the worse you are, the more leverage you have. So, you do a contingent liability liquidation analysis. You show how bad it is. And the worse you are, you have more leverage. You're playing poker. You play the insolvency card. All landlord would get in an insolvency is 12 months or 15% of the lease. They may have two to four months of letter accredited deposit. You negotiate. because the problem is they don't wanna wait that long and you get time on your side here Right. And the reason why you've got to do this and I've had a number of companies who should be doing it now is five months from now when you had that leap of faith. And you've got to go on raising on the 20 million, you have this overhang on your balance sheet. And I'm gonna say, "I'm not gonna give you 10 million bucks when you get to 10 to $20 million contingent liability out there. Exactly. So, a little different twist, but it's all in the mental set of how you run your business, how you expect things to happen. And what happens going forward. It sounds like more than anything, you're coming in and you've seen 110 of these deals. You have to come in with such resilience and confidence that, because I mean, I'm assuming also that, the clients that are coming to you, they're not in their happy state. This is not a fun thing to do that they're coming to you to help it when they're losing. Right? So, you're sort of coming in as their savior as sort of like their messiah. Right? Well, I won't say their savior I'm coming in to maximize value. At the time of crisis. When you have problem, we fix it. At the time of crisis. If you call me as a CEO, I take your call, I listen, etc. But the only way you're gonna get to me is the board told you to call me, or the bank told you to call me. All right. And I'm gonna have credibility and say, "Okay. Here's what the plan is." "And we're hired guns. We'll go in." "You got to write a check to us like everybody else." But we're the doctor on call. Interesting analogy. I had, one of the proposals of is About $80 million invested in a cancer development drug, which is looking real good. And they're out of money. So, the one of the board members is a very high-profile surgeon. So, he says to me, "Well Steve, you've got to do this on a contingency. We'll help you out." "You make more in the back end." I said, "No." Look, I didn't create it. We're going to fix it. I'm the doctor on call. If you're going to me and say, "Okay, Steve, we're going to do some cancer surgery." And I'm going to say, "Okay, I only want to do something and pay you if you do a good job or whatever." So, we like the lawyers and the other hired guns are cause of doing business So, our job is to make sure we get the best value. Move on. And what happens in these cases is that the creditors are able to at least go through and hopefully work with the new company. The customers that are there will be able to maintain a flow that's in their system. So, and also, we do. Very very cool. I mean, it's just a whole different world that I had no idea it even existed. And I mean, I'm sure that, you have 109 different stories. You shared a few here. But I like you and the ones you share to have 109 more than we didn't get to hear. Steven, I need three words that best describe you. I already know what they are, but I wanna hear it one more time. Ethics. Integrity. And Leadership. I love it. Steven, thank you for the inspiration. Toda raba and have a wonderful day. Okay. You too buddy. You did well. Thank you.
