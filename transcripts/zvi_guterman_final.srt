1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,320
We are able to change so many things

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,000
that were impossible before,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,520
and it's only the beginning.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,560
That's my view of this world.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,120
And I'm excited every day.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,560
And that's what I love about my

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,505
again, actually what I do.

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,480
Zvi Guterman,

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,600
thank you for being on my show

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,560
20 Minute Leaders.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,000
How are you?

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,200
Very well, thank you.

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,800
Pleasure to be here.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,000
Thank you for taking time

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,640
out of your busy day to be here.

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,680
You're coming from my favorite industry.

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,400
And I'm excited talk about cyber,

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,080
about cloud.

19
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,880
But even more than those two,

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
I'm excited to talk about

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,000
the entrepreneurial journey

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,560
of a serial entrepreneur

23
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,320
that is now 14 years

24
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,400
into the making of CloudShare,

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,520
an incredible company

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,360
in the cloud space

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,320
with so many incredible customers.

28
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,640
But besides cloud share,

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,680
you also have some incredible experience,

30
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,520
like a lecturing and advising groups

31
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,720
like Innovation Endeavors,

32
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,360
and being on the board of companies.

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,280
So, all around,

34
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,080
just an incredible trajectory.

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,560
Zvi, who are you?

36
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,800
How do you get started

37
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,400
with computer science?

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,680
And what is really your passion

39
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,440
with what you're doing?

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,800
So, I started my career actually,

41
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,280
because I love technology.

42
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,760
Like many others, as a teenager,

43
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,960
I was playing with computers

44
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,440
in the early days.

45
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,840
So, I was born in the 70s,

46
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,680
early 70s.

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,252
'73 to be accurate.

48
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:57,640
And as I was growing,

49
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,680
we got the first computers to Israel,

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,360
ZX Spectrum at that time,

51
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,840
Atari, and later the PC.

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,560
And it was amazing.

53
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,280
And it was, again, I remember

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,920
the fact that you can write code

55
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,400
and do something,

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,400
play games and you can start

57
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,440
having this device do things for you.

58
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,895
And I think we were lucky

59
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:22,960
and I'm fortunate

60
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,920
to be able to witness that.

61
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,880
And I say to many people

62
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,720
that we're fortunate

63
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,600
we are in the middle

64
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,520
of a second industrial revolution

65
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,360
where the computer is changing.

66
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:36,360
We, sometimes we say,

67
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,440
software eating the world.

68
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,200
But I think we,

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,080
in the good sense, hopefully,

70
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,783
we are able to change so many things

71
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:45,960
that were impossible before.

72
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,480
And it's only the beginning.

73
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,520
That's my view of this world.

74
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,080
And I'm excited every day.

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,880
And that's what I love

76
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,760
about my, again actually what I do

77
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,000
is that we learn, we try new things,

78
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,080
we change the world a little bit,

79
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,920
and it's wonderful to do that.

80
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,600
Wonderful.

81
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,040
Take me back to your childhood

82
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,600
when you're witnessing this change.

83
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,440
Because I am assuming

84
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,720
that most kids around you

85
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,520
aren't necessarily as excited

86
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,800
or as infatuated with this technology

87
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,320
as you are, correct me if I'm wrong.

88
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,720
But what was that experience really like?

89
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,120
For me, I should add that

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,760
I wasn't good enough in basketball

91
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,200
and soccer.

92
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,440
So, I guess it's always that you compensate.

93
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,560
I love it.

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,400
So, I was very good

95
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,000
with math and computer science then.

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,080
And again, it was clear that

97
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,960
you could do things.

98
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,720
And again, as I said, I wasn't so good,

99
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,240
I enjoyed playing basketball

100
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,560
and I'm relatively tall,

101
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,240
but I wasn't good enough.

102
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,314
I was a swimmer in high school,

103
00:03:58,315 --> 00:04:00,000
semiprofessional.

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,120
And I understood very quickly that

105
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,680
I want to be the best swimmer

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,480
in all the best athletes in any way.

107
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,520
And I was really good in math

108
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,800
and computer science, physics.

109
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,040
And it was the early days

110
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,360
of computer science.

111
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
And it was so exciting.

112
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,040
So, I really loved it.

113
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,080
My mother really wanted me

114
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,680
to go to med school,

115
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,680
and was encouraging and pushing.

116
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,400
And computer science was a new thing.

117
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,720
So, it wasn't very established

118
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,920
and they actually weren't aware

119
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,280
that I'm going to study that.

120
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,840
But I really had the passion

121
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,960
and they supported me.

122
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,640
And then one thing led to the other.

123
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,880
Like I finish my bachelor,

124
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,680
I did my master,

125
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,320
and then I did my PhD.

126
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,080
And it was, I kept finding new things.

127
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,992
And then a friend told me,

128
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:54,920
"Hey, let's start the company together."

129
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,560
And that turned into my

130
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,200
security company.

131
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,200
And I think,

132
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,280
again, in many ways, you know,

133
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,840
I'll say something maybe

134
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,880
for other people

135
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,640
that may be listening or watching this,

136
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,000
I think we we're fortunate

137
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,560
that in a way,

138
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,400
you know, we sometimes,

139
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,320
some of us look super small

140
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,760
to the big heroes.

141
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,000
But I'll say about myself,

142
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,560
I think we, a lot of things

143
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,440
are just timing.

144
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,280
And it's such a wonderful opportunity,

145
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,680
the world is changing

146
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,280
and you are in the right spot.

147
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,840
So, it's not that we are smarter

148
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,200
than other people that,

149
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,880
but in many cases just we were

150
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,680
in the right time

151
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,640
in this wave of innovation.

152
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,520
We understood it

153
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,840
and many of us are using it

154
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,000
and developing interesting applications.

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,040
And that's actually maybe

156
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,960
interconnected to other things

157
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,600
that I know that you are talking

158
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,480
in interesting many people,

159
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,520
that's still the motivation for me.

160
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,200
If you ask me what is like,

161
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,686
where do I want to go next

162
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:00,600
with my company

163
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,160
and other companies

164
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,480
if I'm looking and joining

165
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,320
on the board level or investor,

166
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,960
is finding innovation.

167
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,840
Finding something that is not trivial,

168
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,280
that software can improve.

169
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,800
And we see a lot of innovation

170
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,640
around health, around enterprise IT

171
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,000
that keep improving our work.

172
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,160
And that's what gets me excited.

173
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,760
I love that.

174
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,120
And now, correct me if I'm wrong

175
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,720
but the timeline that

176
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,040
I'm looking at right here

177
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,640
says that you are doing your PhD

178
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,680
from 2004 to 2008,

179
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,440
but you were the CTO of Safend

180
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,000
from 2003 to 2006.

181
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,040
So, you were basically starting

182
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,520
and sold the company

183
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,840
while you were doing your PhD

184
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,360
in the Hebrew University, correct?

185
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:43,800
Yes.

186
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,390
And I won't to recommend it to others.

187
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:49,000
It's not the best path. And we actually,

188
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,320
so, you can do better.

189
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,880
Yeah. It's not the best path

190
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,000
Like, I feel that

191
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,080
I didn't contribute enough to Safend.

192
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,480
And I would encourage

193
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,240
the other people to focus

194
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,670
on one thing and try to do that

195
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:07,760
all hearted.

196
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,800
But yes, I was,

197
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,240
I really enjoyed the academic world.

198
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,040
And I found the research

199
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,480
actually on security in crypto.

200
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,320
And even on that side,

201
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
I really was focusing

202
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,083
on how to bridge

203
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:29,400
the complex meth crypto world

204
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,720
and the real world

205
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,080
and find real solutions

206
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
to these problems.

207
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,920
No no no. Not at all.

208
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,360
Do me a favor, because you know,

209
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,720
when I'm looking at

210
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,000
a lot of the people of my age,

211
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
not necessarily coming out of units

212
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,920
like the 8200 or 81,

213
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,640
but around the world

214
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,920
that are studying computer science.

215
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,840
And if I look at the things

216
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
that they're really excited about

217
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,160
in the companies that early,

218
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,600
that early entrepreneurs,

219
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,880
young entrepreneurs are creating,

220
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,520
they're not usually in the crypto world,

221
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,400
in the cybersecurity world.

222
00:07:59,400 --> 00:07:59,880
They're in like

223
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,520
the more sexier consumer world.

224
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,240
Can you give me

225
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,760
a little bit of insight into

226
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,080
what is so exciting to you

227
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,840
and so appealing to you

228
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,960
about the complex math,

229
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,000
cryptography, cloud based solutions

230
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,440
that you've been working on

231
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
for these decades?

232
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,600
Sure. By the way,

233
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,280
I was asking is your picture disappeared.

234
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,200
Maybe its a Zoom challenges

235
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,360
So, two things.

236
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,400
And I say these are two areas

237
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,160
that maybe I should talk about.

238
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,080
One is actually in my career,

239
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,240
I actually dealt more

240
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,680
with B2B enterprise businesses

241
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,480
that you mentioned about

242
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,480
young founders,

243
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,000
talking about the consumer ideas, etc.

244
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,440
So, on that side,

245
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,840
I usually, when I meet

246
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,520
young entrepreneurs,

247
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,920
I would say two things.

248
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,920
One, even on the financial aspect,

249
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,600
usually a B2B startups

250
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,600
are 10 times more successful

251
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,800
in the end result, more rewarding.

252
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:17,560
And about 100 times less competitive.

253
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,920
Really?

254
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,920
And usually, again,

255
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,200
if you come with a new Twitter,

256
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,440
usually you'll find again

257
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,840
in the numbers the multiplies,

258
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,080
and let's say if I'm wrong,

259
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,000
only 10 times.

260
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,400
So, usually it's natural

261
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,600
that we come more with the consumer idea

262
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
because we are all consumers. Right?

263
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,040
But actually,

264
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,120
what I would encourage someone,

265
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,360
take a step back,

266
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,680
don't focus on your,

267
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,040
how you can improve Twitter a little bit.

268
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,000
But, hey, look at the industry

269
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,240
and go find a CIO

270
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,320
that work for oil and gas

271
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,200
and ask to join him for a day

272
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,040
or maybe for a week.

273
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,400
Do an internship.

274
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,440
And see what kind

275
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,960
of challenges they face.

276
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,760
You'll be amazed

277
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,400
that people are dealing with multi, tens

278
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,920
and hundreds of billions of markets

279
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,520
and problems that are just

280
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,040
far away from you.

281
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,320
Let's talk about today, covid-19.

282
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,360
I have a good friend.

283
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,920
She works for Pfizer

284
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,160
and she shared with me

285
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,360
just the complexity of the FDA system.

286
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,040
It's a software system

287
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,400
that is dealing with the experiments.

288
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,720
And now, and actually,

289
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,840
she talked with me about it

290
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,520
three years ago.

291
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,880
And she kept talking to me

292
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,720
you know, that's a place for innovation.

293
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,960
So, every founder that came to me

294
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,920
I said, "Go, speak with her.

295
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
This is her domain."

296
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,120
You're targeting 20 companies,

297
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,600
but that's an important area.

298
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,680
And now this is it, you came well,

299
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,560
this is so important.

300
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,480
People are dealing with that daily.

301
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,800
But that's one example.

302
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,520
That's my view,

303
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,720
that usually for us,

304
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,000
again, we used to think as consumers,

305
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,080
but definitely it's when we are young.

306
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,880
But actually,

307
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,480
the enterprise market is big, interesting

308
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,080
and usually somewhat easier

309
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,160
and more rewarding.

310
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,120
Again, if you're passionate,

311
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,000
of course, if your are passionate

312
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,600
for something, go with it.

313
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,280
But just one observation, it's interesting.

314
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,400
Back to your question on crypto.

315
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:19,240
What I found about crypto,

316
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,280
which I think is amazing

317
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,520
and unique to that domain,

318
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,920
is that actually crypto

319
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,080
is the junction of crossroads

320
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,400
of many things.

321
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,440
One complex math.

322
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,280
Like complexity and combinatorics

323
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,560
and a lot of really interesting things.

324
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,080
Second, it's something that if you,

325
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,680
I did my PhD in computer science,

326
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,880
you're always in areas

327
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,280
that are semi theoretical.

328
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,840
And then people are doing things

329
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,840
that are, you're not sure how practical are.

330
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,080
Crypto, is one of the most

331
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,440
practical things we deal with.

332
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,480
So, the fact that crypto

333
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,520
has an amazing influence

334
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,200
on Second World War,

335
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,280
I think when you think about the enigma

336
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,400
and into the what we are using now

337
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,120
and the security challenges

338
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,520
that Zoom had and many things.

339
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,680
So, it's super practical,

340
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,640
very interesting on the academic level.

341
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,200
And so many problems are still,

342
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,480
are still open

343
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,960
and have room to walk around.

344
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,280
So, I think for young researchers

345
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,360
and young entrepreneurs,

346
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,800
there's a lot to do.

347
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,640
And we still face

348
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,000
a lot of challenges.

349
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,240
And I'll give you maybe, one example

350
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,360
I think that we witnessed in the last,

351
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,880
we witnessed in the last year is

352
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,240
cyber war games.

353
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,720
Again, something that I was working

354
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,560
in the last year.

355
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,680
It's a new domain that's really growing.

356
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,320
And it's so impressive to see

357
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
a lot of innovation.

358
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,000
So, cyber war games, in short,

359
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,920
you're trying to replicate

360
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,880
and create scenarios

361
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,840
that will train people

362
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,160
how to react in real time

363
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,440
and how to do better.

364
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,640
And it goes from something very simple.

365
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,480
For example, there's a very nice company

366
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,360
that, again, the most dangerous element

367
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,040
in security is us, human being.

368
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,200
Because we do human mistakes.

369
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,440
And the biggest mistake

370
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,520
is people phishing emails

371
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,200
that you press the wrong link

372
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,440
and you start a wire transfer

373
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,000
or you were pull a wire transfer

374
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,680
by mistake and etc.

375
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,080
There is a very nice company

376
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,120
that is just dealing with that element.

377
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,360
And actually, if you are the corporate,

378
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,440
let's say, again,

379
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,960
Coke, and you buy their service,

380
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,600
they start sending phishing emails

381
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,840
to your IPO, maybe more than that,

382
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,800
to your finance, etc.

383
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,760
And they collect the data, compress that,

384
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,280
and they come to you and say,

385
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,080
you know what, here are 10 people,

386
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,400
maybe you should better educate them

387
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,880
because they are unaware.

388
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,760
I love that.

389
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,560
That's amazing.

390
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,120
And it's a wonderful, wonderful solution.

391
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,440
So, simple and nice.

392
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,960
And I love this kind of elegant solutions

393
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,000
then they are wire

394
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,600
and they can charge

395
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,080
$2 per user per month,

396
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,920
whatever the metric is.

397
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,720
And so nice.

398
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,280
And you don't even need,

399
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,680
like, complex crypto for that.

400
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,160
You see a lot of the innovation

401
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,920
these days around multiparty computation.

402
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,880
This is actually one of the most

403
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,520
advanced things in crypto.

404
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,280
A lot of research in recent years around

405
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,320
how we break a secret that,

406
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,080
and how we between

407
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,560
stuff on secret sharing

408
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,480
that we kind of, we break a secret

409
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,240
between five people

410
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,880
that any three of them together

411
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,000
can open the safe,

412
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,520
but one or two together

413
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,960
cannot do anything.

414
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,000
Or how do we take something

415
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,840
very complex and very important

416
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,040
and we distribute it

417
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,240
between different computers

418
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,960
and allow each of them

419
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,520
to do a slow computation.

420
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,880
Well actually, if you break

421
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,840
into one of them,

422
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,600
you will not learn anything

423
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,640
about the secret.

424
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,400
Let's say you calculate

425
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,720
some insurance ratio,

426
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,320
whatever that is classified or whatever,

427
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,760
or has privacy issues.

428
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,000
So, you want if someone breaks

429
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,480
into a computer,

430
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,600
the secrets will not be revealed.

431
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,360
So, there's a lot

432
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,600
of interesting innovation.

433
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,760
It's also very challenging.

434
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,240
And I should say also,

435
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,720
on the other hand,

436
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,400
entrepreneurs should be worried

437
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,560
or should consider at least

438
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,760
not to do a Me Too,

439
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,080
kind of again using Me Too,

440
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,480
but in another context startup.

441
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,400
Because the other challenge

442
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,200
that we see in security,

443
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,520
we see a lot of companies

444
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,840
that are somewhat

445
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,560
with the bigger need for security

446
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,120
doing very similar solutions.

447
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,520
So you see,

448
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,960
like a lot of new firewalled companies.

449
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,640
They don't call themselves,

450
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,120
they do targeted attacks

451
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,000
and they only analyze the yellow packets

452
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,400
that are going outside them.

453
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,720
So, I would encourage entrepreneurs

454
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,320
to be careful from going that way

455
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,680
because that's really risky place.

456
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,000
And going back to

457
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,280
the beginning of the conversation

458
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,040
where you mentioned about innovation.

459
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,320
And that's at the end,

460
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,360
what's most exciting,

461
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,680
what's most appealing,

462
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,120
perhaps to you as a board member

463
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,840
and an investor.

464
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,120
But really, that's also what's really

465
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,960
warms the heart and makes somebody,

466
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,160
I think, truly passionate

467
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,040
and feel innovative.

468
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,720
So, talking about innovation,

469
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,400
I think that's a perfect segue.

470
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,600
We have just a short amount of time

471
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,840
but I'd love to hear a little bit

472
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,840
of a 14 year journey through CloudShare.

473
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,880
First and foremost,

474
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,800
what is it like running a company

475
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,320
for 14 years?

476
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,960
I don't think many entrepreneurs

477
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,200
get to have that privilege.

478
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah. It's like [--],

479
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,560
you should multiply that by something.

480
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,480
Yeah.

481
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,240
It's definitely a long journey.

482
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,640
And I should say, and also again,

483
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,600
for hopefully for entrepreneurs

484
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,440
that listening to that

485
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,480
and thinking about the beginning

486
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,680
of their journey,

487
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,720
one, I did a lot of mistakes.

488
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,080
And people should understand

489
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,040
it's a long journey.

490
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,320
On average, it's 10 years

491
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,480
And you should find out,

492
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,400
first, actually,

493
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,080
if you are in the right room

494
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,600
and I think one of the things

495
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,080
that happened in the last 20 years

496
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,680
change definitely,

497
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,760
that it's easier to be an entrepreneur

498
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,880
and which is great, right.

499
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,720
We see a lot of accelerators

500
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
and a lot of programs

501
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,600
that actually help you stuff

502
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,000
and I'm the last to judge

503
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,960
but the first question

504
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,360
I'm asking entrepreneurs,

505
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,000
just make sure that

506
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,440
you are in the right room,

507
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,600
that you're doing the right thing.

508
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,400
Because it looks glamorous

509
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,200
and you may think

510
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,520
that I'm just celebrating

511
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,520
between cocktail parties

512
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,400
and you see my name

513
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,800
on all sorts of press releases.

514
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,440
But the reality is that

515
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,440
it's really hard work.

516
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,960
And there are a lot of fires

517
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,400
when you manage people.

518
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,120
You need to hire, you to grow.

519
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,160
Sometimes, things are not working.

520
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
And it's a long journey.

521
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,520
And first thing you need to be ready

522
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,920
and love it.

523
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
And again, for myself,

524
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,120
I found out throughout the years

525
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,440
that I'm really excited

526
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,800
about working with people,

527
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,840
setting the strategy,

528
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,360
solving all of these challenges.

529
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,040
14 years is a long period

530
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,560
and definitely, the company

531
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,920
change itself along the way.

532
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,760
We started actually

533
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,800
we called the ourselves IT structure

534
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,840
when we started the company.

535
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,320
And it was all around IT

536
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,920
and the need to configure

537
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,320
virtual machines

538
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,000
where you look 14 years after

539
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,240
we talk about

540
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,720
business acceleration cloud.

541
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,280
We try with our platform

542
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,640
to help people do more business

543
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,920
and allow them to grow their business

544
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
and use the experience

545
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,240
that head on experience

546
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,600
of their software in the cloud.

547
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,040
So, we actually help

548
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,240
training organizations

549
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,720
and serve organization

550
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,120
to provide hands on experience.

551
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,520
And it was a complete journey.

552
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,320
Other things, we raised a lot of money.

553
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,920
Raised over $30 million from VC's.

554
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,200
We almost sold the company

555
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,880
at least once.

556
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,800
We really did due diligence

557
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,880
for a three hundred million dollar deal

558
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,960
that didn't work out.

559
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,120
I didn't do very well

560
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,920
on the board level.

561
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,120
I did many mistakes.

562
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,760
And the board encouraged or reinforced

563
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,200
and brought the very seasoned CEO.

564
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,400
It almost killed the company.

565
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
So, I witnessed a lot of things.

566
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,380
Then we did the management buyout.

567
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:27,000
The last five years we already

568
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:28,999
[--] and going year over year

569
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,080
with nice multiplier.

570
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,400
It's definitely challenging.

571
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,440
I think again, for me,

572
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:34,880
I found out

573
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,320
that that's really exciting as well.

574
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,600
But it has a lot of challenges.

575
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,640
And as you mentioned,

576
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,040
definitely software,

577
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,320
14 years it's like 100 years.

578
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,880
Like the architecture

579
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,560
of the software is so different, etc.

580
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,840
I can't even imagine.

581
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,600
One of the things that

582
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,680
we're going to have to leave

583
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,960
to the next episode

584
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,320
that we'll do one day

585
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,640
is how to remain innovative

586
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,920
in a 14-year period.

587
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,000
And you're mentioning that in software,

588
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
it's like a 100 years.

589
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,600
And I'm looking at, you know,

590
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,320
I am looking at companies

591
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,320
that I got a chance to be involved in.

592
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,040
And, for example,

593
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,600
the Israeli Defense Force,

594
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,200
the softwares that I built

595
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,040
in 2014 and 2015,

596
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,200
I already had to refactor.

597
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,400
And in 2016, we had to kill

598
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,480
and create a new software

599
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,240
because the world has changed already.

600
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,640
So, I can empathize a lot

601
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,000
with this problem.

602
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,160
And we'll have to wait that

603
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,920
for the next episode.

604
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,560
But Zvi, I want to thank you

605
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,960
for being so generous with your time.

606
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,560
Unfortunately,

607
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,040
I called the show 20 Minutes Leaders

608
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,600
I should have called it

609
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,920
30 minute leaders.

610
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,400
But I have to ask you

611
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,320
the most important question,

612
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,480
which is three words

613
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,120
that you would use to describe yourself.

614
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,320
Hopefully, this junction of product,

615
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,240
technology and business

616
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,680
I love that.

617
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,520
Probably that's what I learned,

618
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,840
that I'm really excited about doing.

619
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,760
I started my career with that

620
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,360
on the technology side.

621
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,560
And all the time

622
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,800
I know that's what actually

623
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,560
where I try to accelerate

624
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,240
and excel and drive results.

625
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,480
Zvi, we thank you for sharing with me

626
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,440
your passion, your curiosity.

627
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,280
I gained so much inspiration from it.

628
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:10,960
Thank you very much.

629
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
Toda raba.

630
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,680
And stay safe and stay healthy.

631
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,000
Thank you, Michael. Happy to be here.
