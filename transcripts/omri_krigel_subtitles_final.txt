1 Omri Kriegel, thank you for being on my show. How are you? I'm good. Thank you very much. Thank you for having me. I am so honored to have you. I've heard so much about you from my good friend Mickey, and you've invested in him. And so over the past, pretty long time, I've been hearing about really a wonderful relationship between an investor and a founder, and I've been gaining inspiration as to the type of investors that I will look for and the type of relationships that I will want to have. But Omri, I'd love to start this show, before we get to your investment thesis and how you operate, I'd love to talk a little bit about you because you have an unconventional story of your life journey. And given all the adversities that you've had, you've come to a really wonderful place with I think some pretty remarkable insights. So Omri, why don't you take me all the way back and however much you feel comfortable sharing, I'd love to hear about the different things that happened along the way and some of the insights that you've gained from them. Sure. So again, thank you for having me and honored to be here. Maybe I'll go a little bit about my background so just so you have the full picture about myself and where I'm coming from and what's my background and etc. So, I was born in a tiny place in the south of Israel, actually in the desert, called Arad. This is where I was born and grew up. I think it really was a wonderful place that impacted me significantly mostly around values and morals, and the people I grew up with gave me the drive and push to many of that of, I guess, the values that I'm currently aspiring for. After a great childhood down south in the desert, I went to the Israeli army and I served for, I guess, around seven years in the Israeli Navy SEALs. So, that was a very meaningful time for me. I served there as a combat soldier, later as an officer, as a captain. And I guess this really shaped my mentality around a never give up mentality, hard work, and things that comes with serving in such a unit. And then I went to do my undergrad in IDC which is the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, and I studied biz administration and entrepreneurship in the Zell program. And this gave me some more understanding about business and entrepreneurship in general because I'm not coming from this type of background at all. Both of my parents worked down south in the general works over there. I had the best childhood, but I don't have the business so I didn't have the business or entrepreneurial upbringing, sorry. But Omri, talk to me a little bit about Zell. So Zell I know very, very well. We had both Liat Aaronson on the show, who was the executive director, I don't know if she was the executive director when you were in Zell, but she's a phenomenal person. And so many other Israelis that have been on this show, Alon Halevy and Assaf Wand from Zell. So, why go to the Zell entrepreneurship program? You're in combat in the IDF, you grew up in Arad, how do you end up deciding that you want to be an entrepreneur? So, you want to hear the true story or just? Of course. So I tell you ... The way it was, I was like every Israeli after my military service I went to travel. Some people go to the Far East, I went to South America. I already enrolled to Tel Aviv University to study the law. And while I was in Bariloche in the south of Argentina, between one party to the other, a friend of mine send me an email saying, "Hey" he was studying at the IDC and he said, "Well I think you would like this program. I think it fits you." And I went to the website, it was 2005, 2006 very different than what it is right now. And I don't know, something ticked. Something made me feel that it's right for me. The freedom around it and the understanding you're gonna learn new things and how to start your own business. And I just said, "This is for me." And then I changed my enrollment and went to the IDC. So, this was the thing that made me go to study in the Zell program. Yeah. So, how was your time at the Zell program? You're starting out saying, "Okay, I might be a law student." You end up in an excellent entrepreneurship world. What were some things that really excited you about it? I think it's a combination of the people around you. And so, one is the people around you. Second is the level of the program, the level of the academic program and the fact that you can combine academic world into real life hands on activities. So, I think that this combination was very unique for me. The fact that I can learn and write a business model on a business that I'm trying to build myself, which was a complete failure by the way, I think that it was a great experience for me. Incredible. Okay. So, you finished the IDC, you finish this entrepreneurship program, and let's continue on the journey. So, finished. Then I basically had an opportunity to open a coffee shop in Israel. So, I raised capital for the first business that I did. I raised capital, significant amount of capital for me back then, from external investors, from the US. I brought a couple of local friends that joined as investors as well. And we opened a coffee, a big coffee shop, in one of the biggest entertainment centers in Israel, in the cinema city in Rishon LeZion, whoever knows it. And I remember the night that I signed the contract of this deal, I didn't sleep for a whole night. And I had a girlfriend back then ask me, "Why didn't you sleep? What's going on? It's supposed to be a happy day." I said, "I can't believe I took responsibility for other people's money. And if it's gonna fail." And a lot of, I won't say insecurities, but things that are coming with taking responsibility and stepping up. Right. It sounds very healthy, by the way, those feelings, right? They are healthy. They are healthy. I think that even now, today, when I will talk later about what I do today, but even now, when I do investment, and I manage fund which with other people's money. Or founders, they take money or take investments from ... It comes with a lot of responsibility, and I think it's good to have this sense of, I won't say fear because fear is not healthy, but sense of responsibility. This is something that I think is very important. So I did that. I did it for six months. I didn't even know how to do coffee in the machine. I don't even know, until today, how to make coffee or anything like that. I wasn't at all on the operational side. After six months, I joined a UK based startup, which they were looking for an Israeli country manager which was quite interesting because it's a UK startup, it's two founders, and the first role that they wanted to hire is someone from Israel to be the country manager. So in a way, I was first employee, country manager, but of a company that just started. It was exciting, right, I had a very great experience over there. I worked with the two founders. We're very close until today. Great investor behind them. And yeah, it was my first basically international experience, starting to work for an international company and learning how to operate in the big world. And I think it was a great school for me. And the company did well later, but I think it was a exceptional, exceptional experience. During that time, when I was basically starting the operations in Israel and hired a team and a lot of responsibility, again, I had a very severe injury back then. It was 2011, and I went to a party with friends and I basically, I went with a very good friend of mine, girlfriend of mine, for a night swim after the party. And I jumped in a bad place, into shallow water, and I basically broke my neck, and I was paralyzed for about, I guess, I still am. I'm still injured. And I have a lot. I walk with crutches and using sometimes wheelchair, but I do still suffer from the injury. But I was in hospital for about a year plus, which was quite interesting because I kept managing the company from my bed in the hospital. Really? Yeah. People came to do meetings next to the bed. It was between rehabilitation, to try to sleep, to do other medical activities. I tried to keep sanity and to keep working. It wasn't ideal, but I still tried to keep a level of, a routine in a way. What was the hardest part if you look back at that year and a half? So obviously, there are so many difficulties that come with such an injury, whether it's the paralysis of not being able to go out of the hospital or not being able to be as efficient as you want at work or maybe in the relationship with your friend and your loved one. So, when looking back, what were some, the really difficult things that you feel that I obviously won't be able to really understand through a conversation like this? So, I think the biggest challenges were, first of all, I felt I think that the biggest challenges were to understand that my life have changed completely and to accept it. To accept that was something that wasn't easy. Just imagine yourself. Back then, I was 30 years old, managing a company at a very young age, dating beautiful girls, doing marathons, triathlons, just super active physically, and then suddenly completely paralyzed. Neck down, completely paralyzed. And then being fed, being washed, taking me from the bed to the wheelchair with a crane. It's losing a whole sense of self I guess, or changing the sense of self in a way, was the most challenging thing, I guess. In parallel to that, of course, the feeling of disappointing my family and the worries about my future and how it's gonna look like and disappointing my friends and everyone around me was, I think this was a very big challenge back then. And so, you finish year and a half, you come out of the hospital. Obviously nine years later, you're still dealing with the injury, but you went back to a lot of the original life that you had before then. And so, let's continue then from that point on. I think that after I was one year plus in hospital, then another year in full rehabilitation, but then I said to myself I was very lucky to have solid family around me, great friends, and feeling that I'm gonna overcome it. And I fought really hard to overcome it. And I always dreamt about doing, decided to do an MBA abroad. So, I was from that young child that grew up in the south who then suddenly you're in Herzliya, which is the center of Israel, and Zell program, and then I saw success. And I wanted always to study abroad. And the first thing that I did after I had my recovery was to basically apply for an MBA abroad. And I went to do an MBA in Chicago Business School. So, I did that 2014 to 2016. - Amazing school, yeah. It was a great experience. Suddenly, I'm studying with so many interesting people, global people, feeling that I'm being exposed to new cultures, new ways of making business. So, I really, really enjoyed that period. In parallel to that, I established another Israeli entity for a UK based company. So, I did that for about another two years. Then I went to work abroad in New York for a tech company where I did business development for the company after my MBA. But I guess from 2014-15 I'm looking for investments and I'm doing due diligence and sourcing, screening Israeli early stage companies for high ... individuals, family offices from abroad. And we did a couple of investments. And in 2018, I've established Homeward Ventures, which is a fund that invests in early stages startups in Israel but not only. We invested also in American companies and others, so we're open. We're not necessarily geographically focused. And I really enjoy it. This is what I do since 2018, and it's a great experience, and I learn a lot. I really, really like it. Amazing. Amazing. So, I think it's just inspiring that from an upbringing that is not necessarily the most entrepreneurial environment that you have, you come through the Israeli military, you go to the IDC, you go to the Zell program, you study entrepreneurship more professionally through creating businesses, either failed or successful it doesn't really matter. But you go to business school, and now you're a renowned investor in Israel. But I also want to understand a little bit about some of the key takeaways that you have from either your upbringing, your military service, the adversities that you've had. And I know that there were more than we spoke about here. But they're very significant. And I'm sure they're a very significant part of your identity. And I think this is a very special episode for me because, unlike a lot of other guests here, it's a very special story that You know a lot of people grow up in a very entrepreneurial household or a very technological household, and they grow into this environment. They don't put themselves there; they are placed there. And you inserted yourself into a lot of these arenas, whether it's business school or it's the Zell program or creating a business. So, I'd love to hear a little bit of reflection from you about that upbringing and perhaps what you would tell your younger self or what you would tell other young teens around the world who don't necessarily have the opportunities presented to them like you had? Well, I think that you can find entrepreneurial spirit or kind of like step up mentality in every culture where you ... I remember my grandmother, when I was young, I think that this is something that many old people in Israel used to do, but she used to buy cheese that comes in plastic cups. And after we finished those cream cheese, she used to wash them and she used to put syrup in there for drinking and stuff. So, I think entrepreneurial and thinking out of the box mentality is something that you can observe everywhere. It relates to the environment that you're at, which Israel is a very supportive culture to that, it can come from your surroundings, but a lot of it also should, I think, I don't know should is a hard word, but I think can come from your inner world and personality to have a mentality or to feel that everything is possible. I really believe in that. I really believe in dreaming big. I really believe that everything is possible. Sky is the limit. All these clichés, they are not, in my opinion, anyway, this is how my life proved me so far. I always dreamt about being an Israeli Navy SEAL, but I was a chubby boy. So, I did a diet at the age of 16 and I lost 15 kilos. And ... strong but I decided So, this is something that I did back then. Or going into the Zell program, which I had to improve some grades. Or learning to walk again ... something that I set myself a goal. I said, I'm gonna learn to walk again. I'll be able to walk again Maybe I can't walk as I used to walk, right, but it's lucky that we do this interview while I sit. But still, I think that setting high goals and dream big and target high, I think is someone that everyone can have. And if you do so, I believe that life will show you the way and things can happen, even if you're not coming from the most obvious upbringing possible. I think that's amazing. But at the end, a lot of people face adversity. A lot of people are trying different things and they're getting knocked down and everybody says, "Just get back up. Just do it again." The knocking down that you had, specifically with that injury and literally being paralyzed, not being able to continue doing the marathons and triathlons, not being able to operate as efficiently as you could as you were in the peak of your years, right, that's a dramatic knocking down. What do you tell yourself at that point when you're in the bed in the hospital and you have people coming to you for meetings, and you must feel inside that you're not fulfilling your potential at that point, right? I'm imagining that it's something that is constantly with you. So, how do you go through that year plus what do you tell yourself in your mind? And obviously that's something that a lot of people that are getting knocked down could tell themselves, but for you, it was a much more dramatic scenario. I'll tell you a story. I think maybe it will encapsulate what my thinking around that. Few nights after I was woke up, I was in a coma for a few days and then later I woke up. And a few days after I woke up, I couldn't move anything. I was in bed completely and I had a high fever and it was midnight or maybe one, two a.m. I was sleeping in a bed in the hospital in the intense care, and my mother was just next to me. And I cried. I woke up and I cried. And I didn't think that she will hear me. And she asked me, "Omri, what happened?" And I told her, "Well, Mom, I ruined my life. I ruined your life. I ruined my brother's life. I ruined everyone's life. Life is ruined." And she told me, "Well, as long as we are together and you are here, everything's gonna be okay." And from a mother perspective, to think that, okay she could have lost her son a few hours ago or a few days ago or whatever, and now he's here, then nothing is as bad. So, I think that I always tried, and I still aspire to try, obviously I fail sometimes, but I always try to grab or hold into the positive and good things in life and try to find a path around that. It was very easy for me to be there and say, "Okay, my life is ruined. I'm gonna give up and that's it and it's done." But I decided to choose the other path, to believe in myself, to believe that despite the changes, things will be OK. And by the way, this is something that I say to entrepreneurs many times. Many times you can hit a wall or you need to do changes in your plans as entrepreneurs. Business plan, your personal life, whatever. And I think that changes are not always necessarily bad. I can also see the good things that happened since my injury. And if you ask me today, "Okay Omri. If I throw you back ten years ago, would you change? Would you jump?" I don't know. I have a child today. So many good things happened since. So, I have work that I like, I have a partner, everything is So, I think that focusing on the positive and on the good is the right thing to do in any aspect, in any element in life. Omri, this was inspiring. Thank you. And I'm very excited to continue getting to know you better and hopefully continue maintaining this relationship, both friendship and professionally, because I just love your outlook. And I grew up throughout high school, with Dan Ariely as also as sort of a role model. And I got a chance to work with him later. He too, he went through some very, very difficult adversity at the age of 17. He wanted to be a pilot in the Air Force. He wanted to do different things, and he couldn't physiclly because of an injury. Let's give Dan a brownie point here because I know Dan well. And after I had recovery, Dan was, we had a lot of conversations about injuries, etc. And he really gave me a lot of support - Amazing and he backed a lot of my recovery. That's wonderful. So I get so much inspiration from the two of you. Right before we leave, Omri, I want to thank you again for being so generous with your time. I know that you are traveling right now. And so thank you for taking the time to do this. But I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. And I'm gonna throw in the first one; resilient is the first one. You have two left, I'm sorry. I never did this, but I'm gonna give the first one. I'm gonna go on a phrase. Well better, I'm gonna go on a phrase rather than words. I think it's gonna be never give up. Maybe that's ... But if you want three words, we can go with that as well however you ... No no no. Never give up is wonderful Omri, toda raba. Thank you very, very much. Thank you. Thank you for having me. I look forward to continue getting to know each other. Thank you. Same here. Thank you very much. Bye bye.
