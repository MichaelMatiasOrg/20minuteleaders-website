00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,320
Uli Gal Oz!

2
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,320
Thank you so much for joining me
on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,300
Thank you very much for hosting me.
Pleasure to be here.

4
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,300
First things first,
there is a jungle behind you.

5
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,300
Talk to me about this jungle.

6
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,300
Okay. So, even before the corona,

7
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,300
we had a

8
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,300
I think that we’re not
living in a sustainable world.

9
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,300
And I have looked

10
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,000
I’ve been looking for ways
to grow my own stuff

11
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
in my backyard to have a local,

12
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,700
basically,

13
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:02,700
almost being like an ...
market. So, grow my stuff.

14
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,700
Okay.

15
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,000
I’ve been vegan for a while
and I looked in the market

16
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,700
for different solutions,
and I found this home-based

17
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:20,700
AI-driven farm.
It has a place for 30 plants.

18
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,700
And it’s a subscription model
where you get every month

19
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,700
pods with seeds.
And it has everything there,

20
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,700
irrigation, lighting,
camera that takes

21
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,700
a picture of the plants.
And basically, it's done

22
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,000
There’s an app and it turns
on the lights and tells you,

23
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
“Hey, you need to fill water.
You need to clean this.

24
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,700
Add some food.”
And I’ve been using it now

25
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,300
for about four months.

26
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,700
- Wow.
- And we’re eating every night

27
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,700
from that small farm because

28
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,700
different kinds of lettuces and spices -

29
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,700
Wow!

30
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,700
oregano and dill, and mint,
and all of that.

31
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,700
I love it. I love it.
And just

32
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,700
One of the most important aspects
of it is it gives you

33
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,700
a great virtual background.
So, you don’t even have to do a -

34
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,700
Exactly. Exactly.

35
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,700
Instead of putting a picture
or a virtual background,

36
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
which my computer is too old

37
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
it doesn’t allow

38
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
I would have needed
a green screen behind me.

39
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,700
So, this is the best
background for me, yeah.

40
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
Wonderful. Okay.

41
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,700
Uli, such an
impressive background.

42
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,700
There’s so much to talk about
from your time as an entrepreneur

43
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,000
to business development.
You’ve held multiple CEO positions

44
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,700
and co-founder positions.
But then, you've

45
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,700
handled numerous VP, bizdev,
and head of business positions.

46
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,300
So, I’d love to, you know,

47
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,700
give me a little bit of background
about where you came from

48
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,700
and how you transitioned
from an entrepreneur and CEO

49
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,700
to a sort of the CBO
or VP business development.

50
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,700
Mm-hmm.
So basically, my

51
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,700
I’m an engineer by training.

52
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,700
I went to 8200 in Israel,
to the military.

53
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,700
I’ve been there a few years,
quite a few years.

54
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,700
And got out of there

55
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,700
and basically,
became an entrepreneur.

56
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Started my first company.
It was a technical start-up.

57
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,700
I was CEO, founder/CEO
but also the technology leader.

58
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:24,700
Ran it for seven years until it ran
to the ground in the 2000 -

59
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,700
Wow
- In the 2000 crash.

60
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
Seven years, you’ve worked on it?

61
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes.

62
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,700
Wow. What was that like?
How hard was that?

63
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,700
Extremely hard.
There were like two or three

64
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,000
So, I had two acquisition
opportunities that didn’t happen.

65
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,700
One, because of me,
because of hubris,

66
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:51,000
and the second because of luck.
I had a signed MOU,

67
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
basically, a signed agreement
that got rejected by the board

68
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,700
for some reason in political
stuff not related to me.

69
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:04,700
And two or three near-death
experiences throughout these years.

70
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:10,700
So, it was a really rough road,
but really interesting.

71
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,700
I think this was my MBA, right?

72
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,200
Basically.

73
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,700
[laughs]

74
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,700
I got down from my
pedestal of hubris

75
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,700
and understood after a few years
that it takes a lot of work

76
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,700
and it’s not you
There is,

77
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,000
of course you have to work hard,
but it’s a lot about

78
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,700
you need to be in the right place
in the right time.

79
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,700
And there’s a huge element
of luck in this road.

80
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,700
So basically, the way I see the
world of technology

81
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,000
entrepreneurship is that you
place a bet on something

82
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,700
that would happen in a few years.
It’s not something that is,

83
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,700
everything that is
totally visible right now,

84
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,500
too late for you for a start-up.

85
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,700
You have to make a bet,

86
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,300
and this bet should be
large enough, but

87
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,700
on the other hand,
not too large that everybody’s

88
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,000
chasing it right now, right.

89
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,700
Right.

90
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,700
So we have basically, it has to be
something outside.

91
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,700
And now the world can either go
that route or not go this route,

92
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,700
and this is something that
is totally out of your control.

93
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,300
So, whatever you do,
you still have to work hard,

94
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,300
but you need to

95
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,000
the world needs to go
your way in a way.

96
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,700
And at least,
I would say 70%, 80%.

97
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,700
And you can pivot,
and so on, and so forth.

98
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,700
But still, in order to really

99
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:39,500
to succeed, something in the world
has to be happening in your way.

100
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,000
Right. But then, you continue
to be in the CEO positions

101
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,700
for multiple other companies
- Right, right.

102
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,700
So, right. So I

103
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,700
Of course. Basically,
I’m an entrepreneur in my heart.

104
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,700
So, even
even as a VP, bizdev,

105
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,000
I’m doing new businesses, right.

106
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,700
I’m working on new opportunities.

107
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,700
So, the activity is very similar.
It’s basically creating new

108
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,000
products and new business
opportunities that are

109
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,700
open for companies.
I think the main difference

110
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,000
for me was the fact
that you’re

111
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,700
coming into a more mature
company and you

112
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,700
So, just a little bit of less risk.

113
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,700
Right.

114
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:27,700
But again, I’ve been CEO before.
Like five years ago, I was CEO.

115
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,700
Four and a half years ago.
So, it’s not

116
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,000
I’m not ruling out going back
to doing that.

117
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,700
It’s just a matter of

118
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,700
It’s opportunities,
what comes your way.

119
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,700
And you get attached to something,
you hop into that

120
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,700
into the role.

121
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,700
Right.

122
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,700
So, I’ve been
After that, I went to

123
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,300
after my first company,
I actually said,

124
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,000
“Okay. Now I want to join
to be a CEO of a company

125
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,700
not a founder.”

126
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,700
And so, I joined a company
early-stage as CEO.

127
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,700
And then, I ran it for five years.
Again, grew it from zero, from

128
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,000
to millions of dollars, again.

129
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,700
And then, at some point,
it was sold.

130
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,700
It wasn’t huge success,
but it was sold to an OEM.

131
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,700
And then, I went to another
CEO of another company

132
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,700
in the vision,
in the image analysis space.

133
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:29,700
Was CEO, got an acquisition offer
that was finally rejected

134
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,700
by the board.
So, I decided to move on.

135
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:36,700
And then, I got a call from Tango.
So, basically it’s all

136
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,700
In the high tech space, again

137
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,700
because in the early stage
it’s a high stakes,

138
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,700
fast-moving market,
usually in three years,

139
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,700
you know
three, four years, you know,

140
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,700
if this is going the right way
or you understand

141
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,700
where the world is going.
You don’t plan for 20 years.

142
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,700
If you plan your start-up for
20 years from now,

143
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,700
you won’t survive anyway.

144
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,700
So, it’s something that

145
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,700
should happen
like two, three years.

146
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,700
If it doesn’t move
in that direction, you know.

147
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,700
I mean, you know, we’re saying
two, three years but

148
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,700
it doesn’t sound like a lot,
but it is a lot. I mean,

149
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,700
it’s a lot of days.

150
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,700
We’re talking about a thousand
days where you’re basically

151
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,700
you’re scrambling to find
product-market fit to even realize

152
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,000
if this is something worth
pursuing. That takes a lot of grit,

153
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,900
a lot of resilience.

154
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,700
I agree.

155
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,700
And again, and at some point
you realize what’s going on.

156
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,700
In my last CEO position,
it was SleepRate,

157
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,700
which was a sleep
improvement service -

158
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,700
I need that.
- ...consumer health.

159
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,700
Really interesting stuff.
There was a huge issue that

160
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,700
consumers don’t really want to
treat their health, their sleep.

161
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,700
They’re all complaining about it,
but they don’t really treat it,

162
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,700
and especially, they can get
a pill for a dollar,

163
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
and they knock themselves out.

164
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,700
It’s much better than
go through a plan

165
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,700
that gives you more holistic -

166
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,700
Yup. Yup.
- It doesn't matter.

167
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,700
So, you fight this fight
and at some point,

168
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,700
you realize that does it work,
doesn’t work.

169
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
And what are the

170
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,700
What is the set of dice that
you have in your hands to play and

171
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,700
you know -
- Of course.

172
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,700
So, I think this is

173
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,700
So, for me, again, CEO is,

174
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,700
in the early stages,
CEO is a product manager

175
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,300
and a sales guy,
and an engineering manager,

176
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,700
basically because you have to
make very drastic decisions

177
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,700
about a lot of things.
- Of course.

178
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,700
Now, as the company
moves forward and grows,

179
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
the CEO position becomes
more of an operational

180
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,700
Right.

181
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,700
More finances,
more organizational structure,

182
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,700
more cultural.
All the time,

183
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,700
it’s about culture.,
but again early stage culture,

184
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,700
the command of early stage
has to transition

185
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,700
as the company grows into
a more organized, structured

186
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,700
and it’s a different
type of management style.

187
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,700
So, as the companies
become more mature,

188
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,700
for somebody
who’s an entrepreneur,

189
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,700
in his heart
if you join this kind of a company,

190
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,700
you need to be in a position
that you can create.

191
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,700
It’s very creative,
very dynamic environment.

192
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,700
Of course.

193
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,700
And that’s what I’m looking for.
So I don’t know if,

194
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:29,700
this is my road map
between CEO and VP/BD.

195
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,700
Very, very similar roles, actually.

196
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,700
Interesting.
I didn’t realize that

197
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
they were so similar,
but I have to say

198
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,700
that your passion for
the two roles

199
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,700
and their junction just exudes
through the screen.

200
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,700
So, I love it and I’m getting
so much inspiration from this.

201
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Tell me a little bit
about the different VP, BD roles

202
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,700
that you’ve held
and what sort of earned secrets

203
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,700
have you gained over these years
both at Tango, Magisto,

204
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
now Moovit.
- Yeah.

205
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,700
Incredible, incredible companies.

206
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,300
Right.

207
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:05,700
So, I think that the companies
who are consumer-oriented,

208
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,700
very, very consumer-oriented,
have totally different

209
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:14,000
BD requirements
than companies

210
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,700
that are B2B companies.

211
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And also, by definition,

212
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,700
BD compared to consumer growth,

213
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,700
if you have an arm
of consumer growth

214
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:33,000
that means internet, playing
with conversion funnels,

215
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
and playing with growth hacking.
If this is the company’s

216
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,700
growth strategy,
then BD becomes

217
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,000
who are the right partners
to add to that that will

218
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,700
increase growth or
it’s not revenue usually.

219
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,700
It’s more like how do you grow
faster. How do you grow better?

220
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,300
Right.

221
00:18:53,300 --> 00:19:01,300
Because the end goal
is consumer growth.

222
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:08,300
And I notice that
in those situations,

223
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:15,300
there is a very strong gap
between the speed of BD

224
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,700
and the speed of growth.

225
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,000
Okay.

226
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,700
BD by definition
is a slower process.

227
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,000
The partners are usually large,
because otherwise

228
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,700
they cannot move the needle, right?
So, you look for partners

229
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,700
that can move
the needle for you.

230
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:36,700
And they usually move slowly
You know Verizon, Samsung

231
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,700
Those kinds of guys, they are

232
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,700
even though for them,
half a year is quick.

233
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
Right.

234
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,700
And now when you try to do business
development with these guys,

235
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,700
you have now to compare it
to the pivoting approach

236
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,700
of an early-stage startup so -

237
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,700
Exactly.

238
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,700
Early-stage startups pivot
so by the time you finish a deal,

239
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,700
sometimes, it’s just totally
irrelevant because the company

240
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,700
took a spin to a different area.
So, there is a race condition

241
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,700
between the business development
flow, which is a little bit slower

242
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,300
with big partners,
and the path of the company. So -

243
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,700
So, how do you manage
that dissonance because you're

244
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,700
coming into these companies,
as large as they may be,

245
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,700
they’re still start-ups sort of right?

246
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,200
Right.

247
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,300
You’re coming in and you’re working
on these incredible, incredible ideas.

248
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,300
Very creative,
but very transformative

249
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,300
with these huge companies.
And by the time that you get this

250
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,300
approved and you get everything off
the ground, the CEO tells you,

251
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,000
“Eh, Uli, we actually
are doing something else.”

252
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,700
Right. So, I think this is

253
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,700
So, it's frustrating.

254
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
Yeah.

255
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,700
It’s part of the role here.

256
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,700
In general, I look at BD
for a start-up

257
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,700
is a very disruptive process

258
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,700
because the product managers
are working on the app on the,

259
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
again consumer phase, right.

260
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,700
Working on the app,

261
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,700
they have a road map.
You know, features, adding

262
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,700
new features, building,
stuff like that,

263
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,700
supporting the digital growth.

264
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,700
And suddenly, somebody
comes to them and say,

265
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,700
“We need to do a demo to Samsung"
Okay, so now, you have to

266
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,300
they need to divert resources.
They need

267
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,700
And then, "When is it coming?"
"I don’t know.

268
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,700
Maybe in six months.
And actually, I’m going to give

269
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,000
you 10 of those,
and one of them

270
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,700
would happen because nine,
you know, they don’t happen."

271
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,300
Yeah.

272
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,700
So, basically
it’s a disruptive process,

273
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,700
but it’s very important
because you understand

274
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:32,700
how the market
So, there is a significant learning

275
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,700
from those experiences
because you understand

276
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,700
what they are looking for,
how they see the market

277
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,700
and it helps the product team,
the engineering,

278
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,000
management team of the company
to really take a look and see,

279
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,700
"Okay, this is how the world
looks at this problem."

280
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,700
As a start-up,
we’re really focused on driving

281
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,700
something that we believe in.
In reality, not necessarily

282
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,700
lives ...
There is a distortion by definition, right?

283
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,700
There’s a distortion in the vision.

284
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,300
Or the vision

285
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,700
is disruptive to the world.

286
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,700
And so but you don’t see
the world in many cases

287
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,700
because you’re so closed view.

288
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,700
And so, I think
So one of the roles is

289
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,700
the BD brings in
perspectives that are not

290
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,700
existent otherwise.

291
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,700
Totally.
- And you know

292
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,700
sometimes,
it does help even though

293
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,700
So, not every time there is
a 90% pivot, right?

294
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,700
Or sometimes,
it’s like a 10% pivot.

295
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,700
And then, it helps.

296
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,000
I mean it’s all, it grows.
It helps the maturation

297
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
of the business.

298
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,700
So, what would you say
are some of the top traits

299
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,300
that a good VP of business
development need to have

300
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,000
in order to be successful
both at young companies

301
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,300
but also-late stage?

302
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,900
So, I would say for
for technology companies.

303
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,700
Yeah.

304
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,300
I think there is a need to have

305
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:59,000
it’s a mix of technology
understanding.

306
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,700
You have to understand
technology because there’s a

307
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,700
If you’re not a technologist
and you come to do business,

308
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:08,700
it’s very hard because you need to
close gaps between what you have

309
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,700
in the technology

310
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,300
and what they look for.

311
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,700
There is a
So, this gap is a technology gap in some cases

312
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,000
that you need understand.
- Sure.

313
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,700
Otherwise, you'll just sell

314
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,700
some ...
something that is not realistic.

315
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,700
So, you have to have
technology understanding.

316
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
If you

317
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,700
Second is that you need to be
to understand business models.

318
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,200
Right.

319
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,900
There is a
There are so many

320
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,000
I mean, the world now is so
complicated in terms of different

321
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
ways to make money,
and to get success.

322
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So, there is a,
there is that part of the

323
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,900
understanding so

324
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,900
And the last one is really
creativity and flexibility.

325
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,300
Basically you have
to be a listener, right,

326
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,700
because you need to understand
what is the partner looking for

327
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,700
and what you have.
And this is something

328
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,700
that sometimes is subtle.
Sometimes, they don’t really

329
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,700
understand exactly what it means.
So, you have to make

330
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,700
this translation of what you have
to what they need.

331
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,700
And this is a
It has a lot of

332
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,700
Usually, it’s very creative,

333
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,700
very,

334
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,700
listening, you have
to be listening

335
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,700
very, very hard to what problem
they are trying to solve.

336
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,700
Right.

337
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,700
And then there is the internal sales,
which is huge challenge as well.

338
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,700
You have to sell,
not only to the partner,

339
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,700
you have to come in
and convince

340
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,700
the internal group whether
that it makes sense to actually go

341
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,300
after this opportunity because,
again, it’s disruptive to

342
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:47,700
the normal flow of business.
So, it’s a tough position,

343
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,700
but I think it’s very dynamic,
very people-oriented.

344
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:57,700
So, it combines technology,
business, market and insights,

345
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,700
product.

346
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,300
It’s actually encompassing
a lot of disciplines.

347
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,300
So, very fun.

348
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,700
Right. So you know,
one of the key questions

349
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,700
that I come across when I think
of business development is,

350
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,700
looking at myself
as a young entrepreneur,

351
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,700
I’m gonna start my own venture.
How do I know when I need to start

352
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,300
having somebody else on the team
that has this entrepreneurial

353
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:24,000
mindset and corporate understanding
to know when to do this

354
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
business development?
So, at what point do I say,

355
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,700
“Okay, the company is now
on a certain mission,

356
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,700
and I need this external factor
or this X factor within my company

357
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,700
to go and to think about these
new corporate developments?"

358
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,700
I think that the real

359
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,700
So, I would say two scenarios.

360
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,700
One, you have

361
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:51,700
you've hit product market fit.
And now, you’re into growth

362
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,700
and into driving stuff.

363
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,700
That’s a good time
to make this addition.

364
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
because then,

365
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,700
You need to grow. You need to
You need to have partners to push.

366
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,300
You also understand what kind of
partners you’re looking

367
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,700
in many cases

368
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,700
as opposed to young

369
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,300
Before that, you’re just running
around to try to understand what

370
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,700
is the product
that you are selling.

371
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:21,000
In some cases,
when you bring somebody like that

372
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,500
too early, and could happen,
then basically, if you are very

373
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,700
strong in your vision,
then it would be a distraction.

374
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,700
It wouldn’t work.

375
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,700
Right.

376
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,700
If you are open and you say,
"Okay, let’s take this kind of a

377
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:41,700
talent as one of the ways to test
the market and to reach

378
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,000
for that market fit"
If this is what you’re looking for,

379
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,700
then you can do it really early.
But it really depends

380
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:54,700
on how you’re
Basically what your preference is

381
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,700
in terms of do you want
to run the business

382
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,700
you know exactly what you want.
It’s more of a CEO trait.

383
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,300
You know, if the CEO says,
“I know. I have a vision.

384
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,700
I know where I’m going.
Don’t disrupt me.

385
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,700
Don’t give me other
Too much noise.

386
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,300
I need to be focused.”
At that point,

387
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,700
don’t bring anybody else because
it will be disruptive.

388
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,700
It will be annoying
and noisy by definition.

389
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,700
The minute

390
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,000
either, you know

391
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
again, so
I think I gave you

392
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
A hundred percent.

393
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,700
It sounds complicated.
It sounds like it’s an art

394
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,700
and that there’s no right answer.
It sounds like you have every

395
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,700
to each his own.

396
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,000
And even

397
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,700
once you employ a certain strategy,
you don’t know what the other

398
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,300
outcome would have been.
But it takes a lot of understanding

399
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,700
and a lot of open-mindedness
to go along that route.

400
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,300
And definitely,
the one takeaway that I’m taking

401
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,300
from this is this idea that you
have to find a balance

402
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,300
at the end about everything.
You have to be focused

403
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,000
on your mission.
You have to be open-minded to

404
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,700
different developments because
it’s not just about your growth,

405
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,700
but it’s about the missed
opportunities that you might have

406
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,700
in the market. If you’re a disruptor
in the market and you have others

407
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,700
that are around the
same time as you.

408
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,700
There’s only

409
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,000
there’s a cake and you want a good

410
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
slice of that cake
with the best partners.

411
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,700
So, Uli, thank you
for all that inspiration.

412
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,000
I have one last question
because 20 minutes are almost up,

413
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and I can’t believe it
every single time.

414
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,700
What are three words
that you would use

415
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,700
to describe yourself?

416
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:27,700
I would say creative, honest

417
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,700
Creative, honest -

418
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,700
and energetic.

419
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,700
I love it.
It sounds like

420
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,700
that’s pretty much
what you need

421
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,700
to be good a vice president
of business development.

422
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,700
Uli, best of luck in Moovit.
I love following everything

423
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,000
that you’re doing.
It’s so impressive

424
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,700
and so inspiring.
Thank you for your time.

425
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,700
Thank you!

426
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,700
Take care.
