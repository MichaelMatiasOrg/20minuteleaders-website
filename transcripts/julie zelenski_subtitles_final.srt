1
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,200
Wonderful.

2
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,880
Okay.

3
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,520
Julie Zelenski, thank you so much

4
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,200
for being on my show.

5
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
How are you?

6
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,280
Good, thank you.

7
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,680
It seems just like a few months ago

8
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,800
we were back in the lab

9
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,200
working in CS107e.

10
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,600
Don't remind me.

11
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,440
Those were the good old days.

12
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,560
That was a great quarter.

13
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,640
How was it online this past quarter?

14
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,480
Well, I think for CS professors,

15
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,240
it was maybe,

16
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,280
we had one of the easier jobs

17
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,080
'cause we already do

18
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,040
a lot of our delivery

19
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
remote.

20
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,480
We do have a lot of students watching via video

21
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,960
and time shifted and stuff.

22
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,240
So, and so much of our expertise

23
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,440
is in building tools

24
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,880
and online circumstances it turns out.

25
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,440
So we were able to adapt.

26
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,640
We had an office hour cue.

27
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,880
Let's say that we ran

28
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,240
off of the Web.

29
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,520
Your average Latin professor, I bet

30
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,160
did not find it as easy a transition

31
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,240
to move from their traditional

32
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,560
in classroom way of doing stuff

33
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,800
to this or like the sciences, right,

34
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,240
where you have

35
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,240
all kinds of physical atributes.

36
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,920
So, I think we did a pretty good job

37
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,680
in terms of transition.

38
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,000
Our class was twice as big

39
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,080
as we expected it to be

40
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,880
which I think indicated the students also

41
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,720
... with their ... in terms of

42
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,240
where can I make progress

43
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,000
and work on my degree

44
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,640
in this time of turmoil.

45
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,400
And so we had a lot of people showing up

46
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,120
in CS I think

47
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,120
'cause it felt like a safe place

48
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,400
to make some good progress.

49
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,720
I'm very curious to see

50
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,040
what the trends are going to look like

51
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,680
now that it's transitioning online

52
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,720
and what people's choices

53
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,320
are going to make.

54
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,480
But nothing will ever be able to replace

55
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,560
the incredible mentorship

56
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,360
that you and Pat provided

57
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,200
at least me and my cohort.

58
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,400
Coming into the breadboard

59
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,720
and physically showing us how the wires

60
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't think it we'll ever be able

61
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,640
to replace that

62
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,800
no matter how great

63
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,360
we'll make virtual be.

64
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,240
But Julie, I want to go back

65
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,120
about your journey.

66
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,560
One of the most popular

67
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,680
computer science professors

68
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,880
within Stanford.

69
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,160
A renowned teacher.

70
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,360
You love teaching, and at the same time,

71
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,160
you love code.

72
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,440
Back at Next, and then Apple.

73
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,000
Experience with Steve Jobs.

74
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,760
And I want to capture everything

75
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,240
in this talk,

76
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,120
and it's going to be impossible

77
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,230
but we're going to start.

78
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,600
Julie, who are you?

79
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,800
Take me through your journey.

80
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,720
How do you come to be

81
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,200
one of the top teachers and lecturers

82
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,720
at Stanford after an incredible career?

83
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,000
It's a master plan.

84
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,760
I've known since day one.

85
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,680
No. I came to Stanford myself

86
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,640
as an undergrad

87
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,600
from a rural public

88
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,960
California high school.

89
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,960
I think without a lot of exposure

90
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,040
to computers or the field,

91
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,920
or any of it

92
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,400
I was a math undergrad, in fact,

93
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,040
all the way through.

94
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,360
And, I picked up

95
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,440
a little computer science late.

96
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,360
Thought it was really neat,

97
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,560
but it wasn't yet obvious to me

98
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,200
how this was going to lead.

99
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,800
It was just one step after another.

100
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,160
You take one class, you kinda like it.

101
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,720
You take another one.

102
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,520
You think it's a fluke.

103
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
I do pretty well in

104
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,240
that. I liked it a lot,

105
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,600
but I'm sure it gets a lot harder.

106
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,320
But you keep making the progress.

107
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,840
I ended up at Next.

108
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,080
Next was just getting started

109
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,560
when I was an undergrad.

110
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,360
And so, at that point

111
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,400
they were still in the education only market.

112
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,200
So, there was a lot of attention

113
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,360
at the university level.

114
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,280
And so I worked with

115
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,440
an actual Next employee

116
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,280
who would come to Stanford

117
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,200
to teach this class, right,

118
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,640
on how the Next was programmed

119
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,400
which I thought was super interesting

120
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,040
and it just totally caught my fancy.

121
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,060
Like the

122
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,200
... at that point

123
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,640
was relatively new.

124
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,520
And when you saw the way it enabled

125
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,200
certain kinds of problems to get solved like that,

126
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,800
it's so freaking cool.

127
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,040
Ok Julie, I want to talk about that.

128
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,040
Why is it so freaking cool

129
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,920
when the software is written well?

130
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,600
Yeah. 'cause, I mean, like,

131
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,920
when you start to write code,

132
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,480
you realize there are parts of it

133
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,600
that are kind of tedious, right.

134
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,480
Like, oh, you're running

135
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,880
the same kind of code again and again.

136
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,440
The idea that figuring out ways

137
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,960
to capture that idiom,

138
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,760
that commonality and unify it,

139
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,800
and debug it, and put it in a library,

140
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,040
and reuse it again,

141
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,520
is just such a huge leverage point

142
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,890
for which you can then go on to build

143
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,160
and solve more interesting problems.

144
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,040
So, running a link list.

145
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,760
Sure. Everybody needs to learn this

146
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,040
as part of their etude

147
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,960
of computer science,

148
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,920
but in the end,

149
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,840
what you really want to be doing

150
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,800
is solving these problems.

151
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,080
And you're like,

152
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,560
Oh, I want to be looking at this data

153
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,000
and teasing out these trends

154
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and figuring out what to do with this.

155
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,800
Or, it's like,

156
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,760
Okay, I don't need to solve

157
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,360
these problems anymore

158
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:08,920
about a hash table

159
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,520
Well, a hash table

160
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,360
it's super awesome and it's wonderful.

161
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,280
But somebody needs to build

162
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,560
a really awesome sorting routine,

163
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,840
a really awesome hash table,

164
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,400
a really awesome graphics ...

165
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,160
a 3D rendering engine.

166
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,160
And then, we all get to build

167
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,720
on top of that.

168
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,400
Like starting on the 10th floor

169
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,440
of our 20 story building

170
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,680
or the 99th floor of our skyscraper.

171
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,720
And so, the idea of figuring out ways,

172
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,680
our tools, and our libraries,

173
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,480
and our systems, can promote reuse, right?

174
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,200
And so we talk about it

175
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,520
early in the sequence.

176
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,240
We're always talking

177
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,560
about the design, and the structure.

178
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,760
I was able to say, Julie, you have

179
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,160
an incredible responsibility

180
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,640
not just as a computer science

181
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,960
faculty member within Stanford,

182
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,040
but you actually teach often

183
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,800
the huge introductory classes as well

184
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,640
like the ... in computer science.

185
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,120
And this is really an introduction

186
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,320
for a lot of students into the breadth

187
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,680
of the complexity behind problem solving

188
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
for computer science.

189
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,760
What is that like

190
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,880
to have the responsibility

191
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,280
of having 400 students in an auditorium?

192
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,840
And Julie, one of the first inventors

193
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,760
and instructors they meet?

194
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,120
I mean, computer science is so awesome

195
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,760
because of the fact

196
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,280
that even in that first class

197
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,840
or the second class, right,

198
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,160
you're really in the meat of it.

199
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
There isn't this really long

200
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,560
prerequisite chain where you have

201
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,080
to spend a lot of time, sort of

202
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,240
I think, on the background material

203
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,280
before you can get going

204
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,080
and do something interesting.

205
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,400
It's like from day one,

206
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,280
in our CS106A courses,

207
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,360
we're solving little problems. It's like,

208
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,760
Okay. Maybe it's Carol the robot and

209
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,240
it's kind of a little bit of a simplified world,

210
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,800
but you're thinking logically.

211
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,080
You're thinking about repetition,

212
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,720
and if-else logic,

213
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,920
and how you break things down

214
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,120
into ... units.

215
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,160
And it's like, every step along the way

216
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,240
is an opportunity to learn

217
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,840
a little bit more

218
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,840
of good engineering practice.

219
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,960
And so I fell like at the end

220
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,000
of those first two quarters,

221
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,440
you have learned a lot

222
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,080
that's actually very practical

223
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,840
and can immediately you can turn around

224
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,880
and start writing stuff

225
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,800
and building stuff,

226
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,600
and doing stuff with it.

227
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,360
People are going off to work

228
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,360
to do internships at Google and Facebook

229
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,480
after taking these course.

230
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,160
It's just it's so accessible to everyone.

231
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,960
And that's so extraordinary, right?

232
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,840
I mean, I'm not a chemist,

233
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,880
or a biologist, or a physicist,

234
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,480
but I feel like they're these really long chains

235
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,560
before you're able to do something

236
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,080
with, let's say, chemistry,

237
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,920
that where you're really kind of

238
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,760
putting in your practice, right

239
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,680
And CS, it's like such a neat steep ramp

240
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,000
from "I know nothing"

241
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,240
to "I can actually do

242
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,600
some pretty neat things"

243
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,480
in such a short period of time.

244
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,080
That's really an awesome place to be.

245
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,600
So then what is sort of your idea or your vision

246
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,480
and also Stanford's in terms of

247
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,360
how do you get somebody

248
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,320
who comes in and says,

249
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,880
"I want to learn computer science

250
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,360
within this incredible institution, Stanford.

251
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,760
How can you best prepare me

252
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,120
over the next four years

253
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
to be the greatest thinker,

254
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,760
problem solver that I can be?"

255
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,880
Because there's a very clear mindset

256
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,080
into this logical sequence that we take

257
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,040
and I'm in it right now and I'm loving it.

258
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,880
I'm so impressed

259
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,680
by how well thought out it is.

260
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,280
Talk to me a little bit about that.

261
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,720
It's totally a team effort, right

262
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,240
I mean, I think, we have a very strong

263
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,120
curriculum design committee

264
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,920
that is in place for the long haul right

265
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,560
And we're constantly looking

266
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,600
at our offerings and there is

267
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,720
One thing that's a little bit different

268
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,360
about Stanford

269
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,240
relative to other R1 institution is that

270
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,200
we do have what we call an Ed Group,

271
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,240
the ED Affairs Group,

272
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,520
and there are like 10 of us.

273
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,560
And that we are teaching only faculty.

274
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,360
And so, the intro sequence CS106,

275
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,680
and 109 and 107, 108, ones like that,

276
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,400
are taught by this group of lecturers

277
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,040
and teaching faculty,

278
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,440
and that means that we give 100%

279
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,160
of our heart and soul to making sure

280
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,760
that that intro sequence

281
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,160
I didn't even know that. That's amazing.

282
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,360
Yeah.

283
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,600
And so, and then as you transition out of intro

284
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,920
and into the upper division.

285
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,240
So you start to hit compilers,

286
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,080
and machine learning,

287
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,360
and graphics and stuff like that.

288
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,520
And so, you'll encounter

289
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,680
the traditional research faculty.

290
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,440
So, someone like Pat.

291
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,600
Pat, and most of us are also people

292
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,920
who are very interested and care

293
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,640
about teaching a lot,

294
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,000
but they're also have an extremely rich

295
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,120
and amazing career as a researcher

296
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,720
which necessarily means

297
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,400
that their attention is going to be split

298
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,680
a little bit more, right,

299
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
and they have more attention

300
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,360
placed on mentoring grad students

301
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:20,920
and whatnot.

302
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,880
So, us being there, right, to make sure

303
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,880
that, for example, we do a ton of teacher mentoring,

304
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,440
we do a bunch of TA training,

305
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,560
we bring our undergraduates

306
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,200
in to work with us in the intro sequence

307
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,760
which gives us a pipeline of people

308
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,640
to step up to be graduate TAs.

309
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,960
Julie, how do you improve? How do you improve on this process?

310
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,680
Because you teach a class of 400 students.

311
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,920
You've just taught it for 10 weeks

312
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,880
and now you have a one week break

313
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,240
and you're about to teach it again.

314
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,840
And as any good computer scientist,

315
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,720
you want to improve and learn

316
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,040
for the next generation.

317
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,160
So, how do you go about doing that?

318
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,000
Well everything I work on,

319
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,160
you can ask anybody who's gone behind me

320
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,920
will tell you, that in the directory

321
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,000
where the files, like the code

322
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,720
or the write up, or the rubric,

323
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,160
or any of the material software,

324
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,200
there's a file on there whose name

325
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,920
is called "For Next Time"

326
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,640
It's in all capitals

327
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,560
It's always named the same thing.

328
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,320
But I put it right there

329
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,480
like it's right by the lecture,

330
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,120
it's right by the section,

331
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,880
it's right by the lab.

332
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,000
And it reminds me of,

333
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,120
as we were doing it,

334
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,240
what was happening.

335
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,480
Was there something that students

336
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,400
got tripped up on it?

337
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,200
Was there something the TAs

338
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,520
told me about it?

339
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,600
Was there something I just felt

340
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,280
coming out of the lecture?

341
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,000
Or if I got a chance

342
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,240
to review the lecture itself, like,

343
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,560
Oh, you know what

344
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,920
that just wasn't that clear

345
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,000
or I need a different example.

346
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,280
And I make those myself.

347
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,040
And I leave 'em right there

348
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,480
'cause it's the one place I'll remember it.

349
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,880
If I put it anywhere else, right,

350
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,040
it's not going to be where I am.

351
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,800
So, at the point when

352
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm preparing that lecture up

353
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,600
and start with the last time I had it,

354
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,360
I'll be like, "Oh. Look, what I wrote down"

355
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,320
This example fell flat,

356
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,520
or this needs to be fixed.

357
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,800
We need to fix this explanation whatever.

358
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,440
So, they're littered throughout

359
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,080
everything I work on.

360
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,280
So, it has to be there.

361
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,600
You're right. I mean everything

362
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,360
is so in the moment for teaching.

363
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,320
It's a thousand little to do items

364
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,520
of this week's lecture,

365
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,720
this week's assignment,

366
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,000
this week's lab, that exam, right.

367
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,120
So, that you need a system

368
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,200
to keep each of them.

369
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,360
And then I'd say bigger things.

370
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,400
Like if you're thinking really about

371
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,960
restructuring an entire class,

372
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,640
or really doing something like that

373
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,280
is generally going to be something

374
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,800
that we work on more as a team, right.

375
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,640
Like if there's a much bigger

376
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,320
let's all get together,

377
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,160
let's all brainstorm,

378
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,240
let's all think about whether

379
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
Like we recently switched our 106A course,

380
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,800
which has been a JAVA for 10 years,

381
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,120
to Python.

382
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,240
And that was a huge effort

383
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,200
of a lot of people

384
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,640
to survey what other schools are doing.

385
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,520
To look at tools that are out there.

386
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,600
Look at ways it would change

387
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,200
our pedagogy.

388
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,120
Look at the way it's going to affect

389
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,080
other parts of our curriculum.

390
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,840
How long have you been teaching

391
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,880
these monumental classes

392
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,680
within Stanford?

393
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,520
So, I've been here since 1992.

394
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,360
Wow. So, what changed since then?

395
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,400
So you've seen quite a few students go by.
- Yeah

396
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,880
... different than other?

397
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,400
In some ways it feels like

398
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,680
nothing's changed

399
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,200
'cause the core of it,

400
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,040
it's still as beautiful

401
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,000
and as pristine

402
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,840
and heartfelt as it ever was.

403
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,320
Which is, I mean I would say,

404
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:20,840
one of the things

405
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,640
that's really important about Stanford

406
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,760
is that our intro class

407
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,360
is our intro for everyone.

408
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,920
That we don't have a majors entry point

409
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,440
and a non-majors entry point,

410
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,880
and an advanced student thing like that.

411
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,120
It's like,

412
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,480
Oh there is 106A which is designed

413
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,880
to be called the big tent.

414
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,240
It brings in everybody.

415
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,280
We want everyone to give a chance to it

416
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,240
and be taught in the way we want.

417
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
Like to build a foundation

418
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,440
for all computer scientists.

419
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,200
So, some of these are classes

420
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
like physics for poets,

421
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,240
or something like that, where it's like,

422
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,640
Oh, you're really not going on,

423
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,240
so we're gonna give you

424
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,520
a different "light" version.

425
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,560
And we really don't want to do that.

426
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,040
We don't want you to have to select

427
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,240
before you've had a chance

428
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,040
to really try it.

429
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,880
And so we want to give you

430
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,120
the same grounding we give everyone.

431
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
We really try hard to get people

432
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,300
to start in the intro sequence

433
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,400
even if they have the background

434
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,680
to sometimes jump ahead.

435
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,120
We often think that we can do

436
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,760
such a good job with setting

437
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,960
the right foundation for you

438
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,480
that we want you to give it a try.

439
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,160
That don't be in a hurry to jump ahead

440
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,400
'cause even in the simple exercises

441
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,680
where we can just imbue you

442
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,320
with really good habits that we want you

443
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,880
to carry forward.

444
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,480
So, that's been the same.

445
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,520
So what I want to say

446
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,600
what did we change?

447
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,080
I would say, we've changed the language.

448
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,000
We've changed the tools, right.

449
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,560
Our enrollments have gone crazy large.

450
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,560
But in the essence of it,

451
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,760
I still think we're doing the same thing

452
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,120
we've always wanted to do all along,

453
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,000
which is show you how empowering

454
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,320
and awesome it is to be able to control

455
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,880
this computer and then give you

456
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,320
this really good grounding

457
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,760
in the fundamental sort of tools and technique

458
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,120
and mindset that makes you

459
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,020
be an excellent engineer.

460
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,000
That's so cool.

461
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,960
Julie, what's missing from CS education

462
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,640
at Stanford or anywhere in the world?

463
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,240
Where are we at now?

464
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,360
And what big milestones do you hope

465
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,960
to for us to get to

466
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,840
in let's say, five years?

467
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,400
I think we need to keep looking

468
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,240
at the service part of the equation.

469
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,800
That I think we serve our majors

470
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,120
extraordinarily well.

471
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,280
I think we have a great curriculum

472
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,560
with a lot of flexibility

473
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,760
and in the undergraduate

474
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,400
the master's curriculum, the PhD,

475
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,960
all of that is really really good.

476
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,920
I think we need to keep working at ways

477
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,960
to give computing power to people

478
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,320
who aren't computer scientists

479
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,480
in a way that makes sense for them.

480
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,600
And so, so as I said,

481
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,920
we have this one sequence

482
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,760
and it's for everyone.

483
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,600
And that's great.

484
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,720
And I do think up to a point,

485
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,720
we can definitely keep everybody together,

486
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,560
but there are places where

487
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,200
there's jumping off points where I think

488
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,960
we need to, for example, there are a lot of people

489
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,680
who want to get data science type skills,

490
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,920
machine learning type skills,

491
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,720
but aren't going to make computer science

492
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,080
their number one focus.

493
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,440
And so, maybe they're a biologist

494
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,640
or sociologist, right, or a historian.

495
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,160
And so I think figuring out ways

496
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,880
that we can be sure to coordinate

497
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,200
and support giving those skills to people.

498
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,520
Like the way the writing center,

499
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,280
for example, might be like,

500
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,080
everyone needs to learn

501
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,600
how to write persuasively and attentively.

502
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,480
And so, figuring out how we can be

503
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,360
computer science support

504
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,640
as a service learning for all people.

505
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,920
I'd say, another big area for us

506
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,680
is to dig more deeply

507
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,840
into the ethical implications

508
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,600
of the work we do.

509
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,960
That I think, we've had a little bit

510
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,120
of like, Hey, we're technology.

511
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,080
We're neutral.

512
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,880
We're just teaching you

513
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,400
how algorithms work

514
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,360
and how to evaluate them

515
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,240
for performance

516
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,720
or for robustness or correctness,

517
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,640
but there's really growing awareness

518
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,520
that there are absolutely

519
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,480
certain opportunities for us

520
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,960
to be reflecting on the bias

521
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,360
in the data sets we use

522
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,320
and in the problems

523
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,280
we're trying to solve,

524
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,640
and in the implications of our work

525
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,880
in a broader social context

526
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,000
which I think we need to figure out

527
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,400
how to make that happen up and down

528
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,120
across the curriculum.

529
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,680
I think we've traditionally had an idea

530
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,160
if there's a class or two

531
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,000
that's about ethics or social implications,

532
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,680
and I think we just need

533
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,240
to weave that through our discipline

534
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,160
all the way through

535
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,080
to be sure we're making responsible

536
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,480
ethical choices at every step.

537
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,040
Incredible.

538
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,680
Julie, take me back now to Next

539
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,360
and then Apple.

540
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,880
You're out of Stanford.

541
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,000
You're entering this tech scene.

542
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,280
You get to work with Steve Jobs.

543
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,920
What is this like?

544
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,720
... I get to be with somebody

545
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,840
from the roots of it.

546
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,040
This is incredible.

547
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,280
Yeah. I think it's like,

548
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,120
when I look back at it now,

549
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,920
it seems more amazing that at the time.

550
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,480
I didn't know any better.

551
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,920
It was basically my first job

552
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,480
out of school.

553
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,480
So I thought it was completely normal

554
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,240
that you have a superstar.

555
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,600
Like for the longest time

556
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,880
I had this dingy car,

557
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,280
this Datsun B210

558
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,640
that was an old junker of a car.

559
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,400
And I used to park a little bit far away

560
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:49,880
from the building

561
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,480
because I thought my car was ugly

562
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,640
and rundown and I was

563
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,520
still just paying off my student loans.

564
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,160
And so, I parked it kinda away

565
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,000
around the corner from the building

566
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,200
kinda a little bit out of shame.

567
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,360
But it was interesting how there was often

568
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,440
a black Porsche that would also be

569
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,360
in this same spot

570
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,840
I picked. It happened to be the first one

571
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,040
around the corner from the building.

572
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,960
And it was a black Porsche

573
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,600
with no license plates, which at the time

574
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,080
I didn't know these stories yet

575
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,800
about how Steve was apparently just

576
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,760
couldn't be bothered

577
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,800
to get a license plate for his car.

578
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,840
And so, depending on who got there first,

579
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
either I would have the spot

580
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,160
or the black Porsche would have the spot.

581
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,620
I didn't realize it was Steve's car

582
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,040
until one day I come out,

583
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,480
and he's parked in the next spot over

584
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,600
and he's standing by his car

585
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,480
talking to somebody.

586
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
And I'm coming out to my car.

587
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,080
And he scolds me for parking in his spot.

588
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,200
And I'm terrified.

589
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,120
I've been there, I don't know,

590
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:37,920
not that long

591
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,960
like a few months or something.

592
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,360
But I'm like, I think

593
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,960
I'm about to get fired over

594
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,560
But he was kidding. He didn't care.

595
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,280
It was just funny that everybody else

596
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,160
apparently all knew this.

597
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,720
Don't park in Steve's spot, right.

598
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,160
But I'm like, Oh, okay whatever.

599
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,760
I'm just trying to hide

600
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,200
my ugly car over here.

601
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,480
But anyway, so then

602
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,730
I stopped parking ...

603
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,080
Unbelievable. How many people were at Next

604
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,280
when you joined over there?

605
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,120
So, we were probably close

606
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,600
to 200 people at that point.

607
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,200
I think we've had maybe four or five hundred

608
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,640
at our biggest when were doing

609
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,440
both hardware and software.

610
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,400
But, we did cut our hardware business

611
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,480
and scaled back into softwares.

612
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,080
So the time we got acquired,

613
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,480
we probably were back down

614
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,280
to 200 again.

615
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,800
So, we were pretty small

616
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,040
that whole time, I would say.

617
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,160
What are some

618
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,800
of the most important lessons you learned

619
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,720
from that time that then you took

620
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,200
with you as you then transitioned

621
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,320
back to education?

622
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,240
Yeah. I loved working at Next,

623
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,640
but the strongest memory, of course,

624
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,200
was just the people.

625
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,120
The people who were hired there

626
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
and their passion for what we were doing

627
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,760
was just really infectious, right.

628
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,120
And maybe the biggest lesson

629
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,040
I took away from Next was

630
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,440
I had to go back to grad school

631
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,560
because I was working with

632
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,120
So, at that point,

633
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,600
I had an undergrad degree in math.

634
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,560
My training in CS was pretty thin.

635
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,440
I was learning a lot on the job.

636
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,360
I was working at an engineering capacity,

637
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,720
but I was definitely a junior person.

638
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,840
And there were all these people around me

639
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,080
who just had a wealth of knowledge

640
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,400
and experience and practice

641
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,240
that I was super envious of.

642
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,000
And I can remember,

643
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,440
people would casually toss off,

644
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,120
toss off terms or tools or,

645
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,600
Oh, well when I was at Sun

646
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,760
we did this kind of stuff.

647
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,480
And I just wanted,

648
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,040
I was hungry for that same kind of experience,

649
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,720
the same kind of underpinning

650
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,880
of what they knew that helped them

651
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,440
to make great decisions going forward.

652
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,600
And so, it was great to work with them

653
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,120
and learn from them,

654
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,560
but I also knew I needed to go back

655
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,520
to the source myself

656
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,800
and strengthen up my own background.

657
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,720
Were you ... that at the time

658
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,680
you were working with some

659
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,880
of the greatest pioneers of -

660
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,920
Yeah. It seemed normal to me

661
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,960
but that was 'cause

662
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,560
I had never had a real job before.

663
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,160
I mean I was in high school.

664
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,640
I worked in a player piano place.

665
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,480
The idea that I thought

666
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,720
it was super normal to have this

667
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,800
just incredibly high powered,

668
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,320
really dedicated,

669
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,720
really talented group of people

670
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,280
that just solved problems

671
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,920
and batted ideas around.

672
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,560
I can still remember the way it felt like,

673
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,400
since we were so small,

674
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,200
you could make decisions about things.

675
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,760
And it's like you keep looking

676
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,440
for some, like

677
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,720
do we have to get some approval?

678
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,040
I can remember going to ...

679
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,200
who was the head

680
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,680
of the workspace development at the time.

681
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,480
And there was this decision

682
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,000
we needed to make

683
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,360
about how something was going to happen.

684
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,920
So I go to him,

685
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,600
he's relatively new too, right.

686
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,640
So we have this conversation

687
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,680
about what our options are.

688
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,920
We bat some ideas around and then

689
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,160
he says,

690
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,000
"Okay, I think we should do this."

691
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,280
And I'm like, "Well, okay

692
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,400
but that's just you and me.

693
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,560
We're like just two foot soldiers here.

694
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,040
Don't we need to go get somebody else?"

695
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,520
You're looking for your mom.

696
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,200
I don't know what you like.

697
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,240
You'd think we have to have some.

698
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,200
And he's like, "No. No. That's what we do.

699
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,880
This is what we were hired to do,

700
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,800
is make these decisions

701
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,680
and make this stuff happen."

702
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,160
And you're like,

703
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,800
"Oh, I guess we just get to do that."

704
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,880
And that happened again and again.

705
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,560
Just lots of cool things to do

706
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,360
and smart people to work with.

707
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,640
And so, from it I said

708
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,640
I had to go back to grad school

709
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,400
'cause I wanna be able to go

710
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,560
deep on some of this stuff

711
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,760
and school's going to be a good place

712
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,480
for me to do that.

713
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,320
I mean I think there are other people

714
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,240
who learn different ways.

715
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,400
It wasn't the only way maybe to catch up

716
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,640
to that level of expertise.

717
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,120
But for me,

718
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,080
it was I had been a good student

719
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,280
and I think the school worked

720
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,160
for my mindset

721
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,080
and my level of obedience maybe

722
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,800
or something like that.

723
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,000
That is so cool.

724
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,400
Julie, as I go on my journey

725
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,160
and a lot of my friends

726
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,240
going on their journey

727
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,160
into computer science

728
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,160
we're at Stanford in general,

729
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,600
what is the one piece of advice

730
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,080
you would give a young student

731
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,640
as we're about to go and absorb

732
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,040
so many classes

733
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,560
from so many incredible instructors?

734
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,680
What are some things

735
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,840
that I can keep in mind

736
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,640
as I go through this journey

737
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,970
and maintain perspective?

738
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:42,680
Wow.

739
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,040
I would, there's so many great things

740
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,440
about Stanford, right.

741
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,720
And so many great experiences.

742
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,520
And the one thing I would say is just

743
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,800
be mindful of picking and choosing.

744
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,120
Realizing that saying "yes" to something

745
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,320
often means having to say "no"

746
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,600
to something else and thinking about,

747
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,720
as you look at things,

748
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,600
there's going to be lots of things

749
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,160
that sound really awesome

750
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,440
and are really awesome,

751
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,440
but if they're not right for you,

752
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,560
they're going to eat away

753
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,040
from getting a lot of things

754
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,760
that really matter for you.

755
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,280
So sometimes it's easy to get people

756
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,880
get, I think, a little bit sidelined.

757
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,640
Somebody else is doing this

758
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,680
and that sounds really cool.

759
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,800
Or this seems kind of interesting.

760
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,200
Or I want to take all these classes.

761
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,080
I want to have a double major.

762
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,760
I want to do all this stuff.

763
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,720
And ...

764
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,440
by spreading yourself too thin,

765
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,920
you miss some of the discernment of saying

766
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,280
what are the things

767
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
I really want to be sure

768
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,480
I get from Stanford

769
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,320
and I want to make sure

770
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,480
I don't miss out on,

771
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,280
and that really are going to fuel me

772
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,040
for the future.

773
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,680
And then recognize that,

774
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,200
as I say yes to those things,

775
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,680
I want to say yes wholeheartedly

776
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,880
and enthusiastically

777
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,480
and that's gonna give me the strength

778
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,320
to also say no to things

779
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,080
that would otherwise cut into that.

780
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,280
I love it.

781
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,320
I see a lot of students who just seem like

782
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,160
they're just really spread very very thin.

783
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,930
And I feel like that

784
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:04,560
they get very over-committed.

785
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,920
And then they're dealing with, I think,

786
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,440
a lot of stress and a lot of

787
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,460
I think suboptimal results for that.

788
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,920
I mean, I think that one of the things

789
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,720
that I came in

790
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,880
and was completely blown away

791
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,400
was by the number of opportunities,

792
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,800
and everywhere you turn,

793
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,400
somebody is doing something so cool.

794
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,240
And coming in,

795
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,600
it's like in a playground.

796
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,280
You just want to go on ...

797
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,800
get all the different fruits.

798
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,680
And I think that

799
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,720
one of the hard lessons

800
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,440
that I had to learn,

801
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,480
as well as my friends,

802
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,160
is understanding that,

803
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,480
Okay, well if we really want

804
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,000
to enjoy this time

805
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,800
and make it work for us,

806
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,040
we need to also be able

807
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,880
to devote ourselves

808
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,240
to the projects we commit to.

809
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,400
And it's not gonna do service

810
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,040
to anybody if we just go

811
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,360
and do ... and do five clubs.

812
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,600
So I completely, I take this with me.

813
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,800
You already have that advice

814
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,200
it turns out. I have to give you a different

815
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:54,920
piece of advice next time, right.

816
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,680
'cause that is a great thing

817
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,080
to have already figured out.

818
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,480
I'm gonna come back for many more advises

819
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,000
along the way.

820
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,160
But Julie, I have to know three words

821
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,920
that you would use to describe yourself.

822
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,040
Okay. I'm going to give you curious

823
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,800
'cause I think that's driven a lot

824
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,760
of what got me everywhere I wanted to be

825
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,880
was just wanting to know,

826
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,440
wanting to see it through.

827
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,600
And then it comes with a heavy dose

828
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,440
of stubborn

829
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,360
'cause I think that

830
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,480
stubbornness and curiosity,

831
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,920
I think, drive all the debugging

832
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,360
in the world, right.

833
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,400
it turns out

834
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,760
I'm gonna figure this out,

835
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,720
and I'm going to know why,

836
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,880
and I'm going to get there.

837
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,200
And then I think what makes me a teacher,

838
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,840
I think, is enthusiasm.
- I love it.

839
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,680
The least I can say, I think,

840
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,960
almost definitively why I'm a teacher

841
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,760
is any time I learn something,

842
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,760
the first thing I'm thinking about

843
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,520
is who am I going to tell that to?

844
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,440
Like I read something in a paper,

845
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,800
or see it online, or go to a talk,

846
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,640
and then I'm like, who else wants to hear

847
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,040
this really cool thing that I learned?

848
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,560
So I think that if you see yourself

849
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,240
as this conduit for information

850
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,520
to come in and flow out,

851
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,440
then teaching maybe the career

852
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,560
you want to look at.

853
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,320
I love it.

854
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,600
Okay, Julie, thank you very very much,

855
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,800
this was inspiring.

856
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,960
I learned so much and I can't wait

857
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,680
to share this with the world.

858
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,200
Thank you for taking the time to do this.

859
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,000
Thank you, Michael. Good to see you.

860
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,360
And thank you for an amazing quarter

861
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,560
of 107e and I can't wait to take more class with you.

862
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,720
It was really inspiring. Really.

863
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,160
Yeah. Yeah.

864
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,800
... that's a whole topic

865
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,200
we could go on for a long time about it

866
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,920
like how phenomenal it is to work

867
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,040
with the people at Stanford.

868
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,120
So, Pat Hanrahan, our co-instructor.

869
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,800
who tas the Turing Award winner.

870
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,080
I just never thought I would spend

871
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,000
my career in the company

872
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,560
of such luminaries nonstop, right. 

873
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,400
So, it has been really a great ride.

874
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,240
It was also a very humbling experience

875
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,080
all of a sudden to be exposed to that.

876
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,720
Julie, thank you very very much.

877
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,800
Have a great rest of the day.

878
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,520
And stay safe and stay healthy.

879
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,240
Thank you. You too.

880
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:43,760
Bye bye.
