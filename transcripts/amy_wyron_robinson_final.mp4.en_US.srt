1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,919
Basically, it was like,

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:01,919
get out of your heads,

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,479
start doing things and make it happen

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,500
and it feels great.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,159
Amy Wyron Robinson,

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,720
how are you?

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,959
Doing great, thanks.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,640
How's it going?

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,160
Wonderful.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,760
Thank you so much

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,560
for being on my show.

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,640
I'm very excited to talk to you

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,000
about mobility, transportation.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,320
You were the VP Global at Gett taxi,

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,360
Israeli-based Unicorn

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,440
that is a hugely popular

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,920
ride sharing service.

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,520
But before that,

19
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:50,919
you were also very involved

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,799
with Waze and Moovit.

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,080
Now, most recently,

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,560
the chief operations officer of Nemodata.

23
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,560
But your journey is a little bit weird.

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,600
It wasn't obvious

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,080
that you're going to end up

26
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,520
being the CEO of a growing startup

27
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,800
or the VP at a unicorn.

28
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,840
You actually started back

29
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,720
in Duke in politics.

30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,320
So, talk to me a little bit about that.

31
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,120
And I'd love to tie in,

32
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,840
your fun fact of being,

33
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,960
being a certified yoga instructor.

34
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:18,840
Yes.

35
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,800
So, lots of different elements

36
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,160
and all going together.

37
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,080
So, first of all,

38
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,400
thank you for having me.

39
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,760
It's really a pleasure to be here

40
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,200
and share a little bit about my journey.

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,560
So, you're right.

42
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,560
I started back

43
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,280
studying politics and economics

44
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,320
back at Duke many, many years ago.

45
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,320
And I thought

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,520
that I wanted to be a diplomat.

47
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,200
That was my kind of first career.

48
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,320
I grew up in Washington, DC.

49
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,600
And then at some point I realized

50
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,720
that being a diplomat

51
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,200
meant working for the government,

52
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,280
which wasn't suited so well

53
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,000
to my personality.

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,280
And I decide to look for other

55
00:01:57,281 --> 00:02:00,960
opportunities or ways to go abroad,

56
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,240
and kind of reached out

57
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240
to some people at Duke,

58
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,880
ended up working in Latin America

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,680
for about four years.

60
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,320
How did you get to Latin America?

61
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,240
It's not the most obvious path

62
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:16,479
from Israel to Duke to Latin America.

63
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:16,799
Yeah.

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,080
So, I went there

65
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,800
initially to study abroad.

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,920
I had the choice between

67
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,520
Spain or Bolivia,

68
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,480
and I chose Bolivia,

69
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,760
kind of the less traveled path.

70
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,520
And after spending some time there,

71
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,760
I got connected with some alumni

72
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,600
from my university

73
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,440
just to ask them,

74
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,240
I was really curious,

75
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,120
-what are you doing here?

76
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,400
-how are you doing it?

77
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,920
And so, from those conversations,

78
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,000
it ended up turning into a role for me.

79
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,400
And it grew from there.

80
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,959
So, after a couple of years,

81
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,600
I decided that I wanted to continue

82
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,360
growing in my career,

83
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,440
and do my MBA.

84
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,440
But there was some really,

85
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,920
there was a dissonance between

86
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,160
going from Latin America

87
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,040
back to the US to do an MBA there.

88
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,800
So, enter Israel.

89
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,440
During that time

90
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,200
I visited Israel for the first time.

91
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,480
And startup nation,

92
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,720
everything's exciting

93
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,440
that's going on here.

94
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,560
So, I decided to come to Israel

95
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
to do my MBA

96
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,280
10 years ago.

97
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,600
And you could say the rest is history.

98
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,160
The rest is history.

99
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,920
Yeah.

100
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,680
So, that history

101
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,960
is still very, very long

102
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,280
because you've been

103
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:25,359
an MBA consultant for Waze,

104
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,759
and then you worked for Moovit

105
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,599
and Gett Taxi,

106
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,280
Why Mobility?

107
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:31,639
What is it about mobility

108
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,200
that really got you excited?

109
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,879
So, during my MBA,

110
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,880
we had a project where we

111
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:41,559
reached out to an Israeli startup

112
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,679
and basically had to pitch ourselves

113
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,919
to do a project during our studies.

114
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,200
So, my teammates and I

115
00:03:48,201 --> 00:03:51,199
pitched ourselves to Waze.

116
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,999
We wrote an email to Uri Levine.

117
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,800
"Hi Uri,

118
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,919
we would love to work

119
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,839
for you, with you on any project

120
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,639
that you need."

121
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,999
And to our delight,

122
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,960
he replied, "Sure."

123
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:09,239
As simple as that.

124
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,840
Just kind of,

125
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,359
shooting for what you want

126
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,679
and sometimes you surprise yourself.

127
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,639
So anyway, Uri became an amazing mentor.

128
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,559
And I think it's really through him,

129
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,079
that first of all,

130
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,959
that I fell in love with startups

131
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,279
and decided to stay in Israel,

132
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,479
not only do my MBA here.

133
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,760
And also he taught me the difference

134
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,400
between managing and building.

135
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:35,239
And when you go to your MBA,

136
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,519
a lot of it is about managing.

137
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,880
How do you manage you pin

138
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,520
how you manage, how you control,

139
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,880
versus building something new.

140
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,440
Yeah, so I think in startups,

141
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,680
especially in the world,

142
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,920
again, you ask about mobility,

143
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,500
-why do I like it?

144
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,080
-why am I into it?

145
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,120
Because it's changing.

146
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,000
Because it's growing.

147
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,960
It's not managing

148
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,080
something that exists,

149
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,000
it's building something

150
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,280
that you are imagining for the future.

151
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,960
And taking all of the micro steps now

152
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,040
to make this macro vision a reality,

153
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,880
this is something I think

154
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,560
that he really encouraged us to do.

155
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
He basically was like,

156
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,520
get out of your heads,

157
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,440
start doing things,

158
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,080
and make it happen.

159
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,680
And it feels great.

160
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
So, yeah.

161
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,280
So, this is how I got into startups,

162
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,000
into mobility and through Uri

163
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,120
I met the founders Moovit.

164
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,360
So, even within mobility

165
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,960
what's been your sweet spot?

166
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,200
What has been the area

167
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,240
that you've been really focusing on?

168
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
So, I would say

169
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,520
there is kind of two aspects

170
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,160
to what really gets me excited.

171
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,400
One is, like you mentioned,

172
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,040
building from scratch to scale.

173
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:44,999
So, having this kind of

174
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,239
zoom in, zoom out approach,

175
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,320
what's the macro vision,

176
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,280
what's our North Star,

177
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:51,399
where are we aiming for,

178
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,999
and then kind of reverse engineering

179
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,439
all of the little steps

180
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,839
that need to be executed on

181
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,440
to get there.

182
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,760
So, it's not enough to have

183
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,520
only the vision,

184
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,920
you have to be able to execute on it

185
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,600
and you have to be able

186
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,840
to engage people around it.

187
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,360
So, I'd say it's kind of building

188
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,800
from scratch to scale

189
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,000
is something that,

190
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
if I think of the moments

191
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,600
that were most exciting or most,

192
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:13,559
when I was in my state of flow,

193
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,719
it's these moments.

194
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,199
And I think the other piece of it

195
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,559
is partnerships.

196
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,079
So, a lot of my career

197
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,880
has focused on

198
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,599
partnering with others

199
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,839
to create value,

200
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,919
both within the organization,

201
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,880
other organizations.

202
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,040
And kind of trying to figure out

203
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,320
how we can get there together

204
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,960
because we're not going

205
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,440
to get there alone.

206
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:35,839
Right.

207
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,600
But still, it comes to me that,

208
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,720
the things that you were mentioning,

209
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,120
the zoom in, zoom out scale partnerships,

210
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
that is something

211
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,960
that is pretty common

212
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,760
to across the board

213
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,160
when you're looking at the tech sector.

214
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,040
No matter really what industry you're in,

215
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,280
you're going to be dependent on,

216
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,240
and reliant on the partnerships,

217
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,080
and on great scale and growth

218
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,480
on any size of businesses.

219
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,160
So, still, why mobility?

220
00:06:58,161 --> 00:06:59,599
Why helping people get

221
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,760
from point A to point B?

222
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,240
Because I can imagine

223
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,880
you now going to Slack

224
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,800
or Twitter or Google and saying,

225
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
we can do the same thing there.

226
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,840
I think there's something

227
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,000
really special about mobility.

228
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,280
I love it, obviously.

229
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,520
There's something about the fact

230
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,799
that it affects your daily life.

231
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,600
Someone mentioned that a good app

232
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,760
should be like a toothbrush,

233
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,000
you use it twice a day.

234
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,039
And so, I think mobility is something

235
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,119
that really affects our lives

236
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,120
and affects the quality of our lives.

237
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,680
When it comes to your commute,

238
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,160
how much time you're spending,

239
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,920
getting where you're going.

240
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,720
These days, these covid days,

241
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,240
it's a bit different,

242
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,000
-how is it changing,

243
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,640
-how is it evolving.

244
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,480
But I think that we're seeing

245
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,520
these dramatic dramatic shifts

246
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,480
in something that affects

247
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,880
people's daily lives

248
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,040
in a really significant way.

249
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,400
I mean, hours and hours of every day

250
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
are spent moving around.

251
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,760
And so, I really get excited

252
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,800
about things that can really impact.

253
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,640
So, having seen a lot of the different

254
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,840
innovations that have been going on

255
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,640
over the past few years in the space,

256
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,600
where are we heading?

257
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,640
Because it feels to me

258
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:12,399
as more of a bystander that

259
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,799
we have these great tech companies

260
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,680
that are developing

261
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,760
these great technologies

262
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,680
to link drivers and riders,

263
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,760
even link riders and riders.

264
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,080
But we've reached some milestone where,

265
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,520
it's easy for me to get a taxi

266
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,480
no matter what,

267
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,720
but I haven't seen really

268
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,760
major advancements

269
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,000
in the past two, three years.

270
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,400
Are there big advancements

271
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,400
to look forward to in the mobility space?

272
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:36,840
Sure.

273
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,560
So, I think there's kind of two areas

274
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,240
that are exciting to me around mobility.

275
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,760
One is, you mentioned there's lots

276
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,040
of different private companies

277
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
working individually.

278
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,200
And I'll go back to my public policy

279
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
and also my partnerships

280
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,200
kind of vision to say

281
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,040
there's an ecosystem that is yet

282
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,120
to be created,

283
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,280
where these systems

284
00:08:58,281 --> 00:09:01,519
are working together and where it's not,

285
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,960
there's a place for the city

286
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,000
to be involved there

287
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and kind of what's for the public good.

288
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,320
Right.

289
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,360
Not only individual companies

290
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,280
with individual riders,

291
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,040
but starting to look

292
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,039
at the city as a whole.

293
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,840
There's this whole concept

294
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,120
of the 15 minute city that

295
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,240
I think is really interesting

296
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,080
and really exciting.

297
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,720
What is the concept of 15 minute city?

298
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,080
I don't know that.

299
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,080
You can get anywhere in 15 minutes.

300
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,640
That's what makes a good city

301
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,280
according to this theory.

302
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,360
It means having

303
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,960
certain goods and services close to you

304
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,360
and it means

305
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,760
having accessible transportation

306
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,600
to get where you need to go.

307
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,320
I think it would be great

308
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:37,200
to get anywhere in 15 minutes.

309
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,639
I think this is one area

310
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,319
that we're going to see

311
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,960
more developments

312
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,200
that actually help people

313
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,040
in their lives.

314
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,720
And I think the second area is around,

315
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,480
and this is something

316
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:48,319
that's really exciting to me,

317
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,160
thinking about Nemodata,

318
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,760
is this area of artificial intelligence.

319
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,640
So, starting to see not only

320
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,400
how we have the operation side

321
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,800
of these mobility services

322
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,680
that are doing a good job today

323
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,680
of offering rides

324
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,720
or offering scooters

325
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,760
or whatever the case may be,

326
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,480
but then starting to have this

327
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,080
artificial intelligence is actually

328
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,360
optimizing things on a level beyond.

329
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,080
So, I think that's something

330
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,840
that's really exciting.

331
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,600
And there's a lot to be explored there.

332
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,960
Even before we talk about

333
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,840
what Nemodata actually does,

334
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,800
what is the problem

335
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
that you're describing here,

336
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,120
that you're saying on one hand,

337
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,440
we have the operations

338
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,080
and we're getting pretty good at them

339
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,920
and matching

340
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,520
and doing all the logistical stuff,

341
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,160
what is that layer that we're missing?

342
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,640
What do you think?

343
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,520
Yeah. Yeah.

344
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,320
So, I think that, and again,

345
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,200
it can be from everything,

346
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,400
from scooters to logistics,

347
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,200
but there's so much data

348
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,600
that's being generated,

349
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,560
so much data.

350
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,920
And I'm not talking about,

351
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,400
Michael wakes up here and goes here.

352
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,600
I'm not talking about this unique data.

353
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm talking about aggregated,

354
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,080
kind of on a macro level.

355
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,280
There's so much data being generated

356
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,200
and it's almost like a tsunami

357
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,400
that then, you know, it takes

358
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,680
I think the next phase is to say,

359
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,760
okay, what data do we actually need

360
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,680
and how can we use it

361
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,360
to actually bring insights

362
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,200
that improve things.

363
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,400
I think when it comes

364
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,320
to artificial intelligence,

365
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,400
this is where artificial intelligence

366
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,920
can help us see through the noise

367
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,240
or cut through the noise

368
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,520
and come up with really smart,

369
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,320
actionable things to do

370
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
to actually take improvements.

371
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,520
It becomes beyond just

372
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,880
moving from point A to point B

373
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,320
as an individual and it becomes,

374
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,400
how do we optimize the whole system.

375
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,720
Right.

376
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,520
Kind of macro.

377
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,760
So, Nemodata is trying

378
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,399
to work on that problem.

379
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,599
But how do you do that?

380
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,799
How do you approach this new market

381
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,719
with this new understanding

382
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,760
that a bunch of this data also,

383
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,520
I mean, you're coming from

384
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,640
a world of partnerships,

385
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,920
you need to acquire the data

386
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,640
from these partners?

387
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:49,072
Sure. Sure.

388
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,440
So, Nemo is looking

389
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,320
at preventive maintenance.

390
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,480
So, preventing breakdowns for fleets

391
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,960
and before they actually happen.

392
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,680
So, we see a tremendous opportunity

393
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,760
both in terms of commercial vehicles,

394
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,160
like Class A trucks that break down.

395
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,320
They break down a lot

396
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,720
and it costs a lot

397
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,080
both in the expense of fixing it

398
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,800
and also the revenue that's being missed

399
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,760
when those trucks aren't working.

400
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,080
We see shifts to electric vehicles,

401
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,400
we see shifts to autonomous vehicles.

402
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,160
So, all these really interesting things

403
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,880
that are happening with fleets.

404
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,200
And then somebody's got to prevent them

405
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,000
from actually breaking down,

406
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,560
and make sure that those fleets

407
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,400
are actually running

408
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,920
and that they're on the road.

409
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:34,639
I don't know about you,

410
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,560
I wouldn't want to be

411
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
on an autonomous vehicle

412
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,320
that just stops working.

413
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,480
And there's no driver to tell me.

414
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,360
No, no.

415
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,080
There's no driver to

416
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,440
keep an eye on things.

417
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,960
It really needs to be

418
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,080
through artificial intelligence.

419
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,720
And also with electric vehicles,

420
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,880
nobody's run these vehicles

421
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,920
constantly 24 hours a day.

422
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,720
Commercial vehicles

423
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,400
have all kinds of stresses on them

424
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,760
that we don't know yet.

425
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,720
So, there's a huge place

426
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,040
for artificial intelligence to help us

427
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,880
take all the sensors,

428
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,240
pull the data in, compute it,

429
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,080
and come up with some

430
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,400
actionable insights there.

431
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,640
I think what you're saying is fascinating

432
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
because I've never even thought of this.

433
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,840
When I think of, you know,

434
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,400
moving to autonomous vehicles.

435
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,520
It's the eminent future

436
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,840
that is hopefully not too far away.

437
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,760
I'm thinking of myself being in a car,

438
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,120
and I'm not even worried

439
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,680
that the car will do an accident

440
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,080
because I trust the autonomous vehicle

441
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,960
more than I trust myself.

442
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,440
And I'm a pretty good driver

443
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,880
and I still trust the autonomous vehicle

444
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,840
much more than I trust myself.

445
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,360
But obviously, any machinery,

446
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,320
anything that is moving,

447
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,240
has moving pieces,

448
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:40,119
let alone electricity running through it,

449
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,959
is going to break down at some point.

450
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,319
So, even if that autonomous vehicle

451
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,839
breaks down once every five years.

452
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,279
Right?

453
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,399
That's still a scary thought.

454
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,560
And I would want something

455
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,200
to be able to tell me,

456
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,720
to tell the company operating it,

457
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,520
"By the way,

458
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,000
we think in the next few weeks,

459
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,320
you might want to check

460
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,880
on a few things here."

461
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,640
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

462
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,960
There's definitely a place

463
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,440
for artificial intelligence

464
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
to do the things

465
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,960
in the background that we,

466
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,360
as consumers or drivers take for granted.

467
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,480
From your perspective,

468
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,400
the vehicle should show up

469
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,280
and it should work.

470
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,200
And everything that has to do

471
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,120
with preventing issues

472
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,000
should be happening all around.

473
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,920
100%.

474
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,680
I'm guessing that until

475
00:14:20,681 --> 00:14:22,319
these solutions come to place,

476
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,760
the obvious solution

477
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,040
is going to have to be regular checkups,

478
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,680
regular maintenances.

479
00:14:27,681 --> 00:14:29,919
I believe that when I spoke to Gal,

480
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,840
from Nemodata, he shared with me

481
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,120
these astonishing facts

482
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,040
about truck breakdowns

483
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,960
across the United States.

484
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,040
And how much money

485
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,840
is being wasted

486
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,560
in daily, monthly, annually,

487
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,960
on truck breakdowns

488
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,680
that could be prevented

489
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,960
if you would just have those sensors

490
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,680
that are predicting

491
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,400
when it's going to happen.

492
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah. Yeah.

493
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,360
There's definitely major applications

494
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,720
for this today.

495
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,400
So, the figures we've seen are that

496
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,320
there's 85 billion dollars

497
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,520
wasted every year--

498
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:02,920
Unbelievable.

499
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,200
--just to use on truck breakdowns

500
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,880
that could be prevented,

501
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,560
both in, again,

502
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,400
those direct costs

503
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
and in lost revenue

504
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,560
from the vehicle not working.

505
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,120
Actually those same vehicles

506
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,200
are responsible for 5%

507
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,640
of the US greenhouse gas emissions,

508
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,560
which is an insane amount.

509
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,440
But it doesn't have to be that way.

510
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:26,399
You can also reduce the emissions

511
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,319
by keeping a vehicle in top form,

512
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,639
by changing the parts on time,

513
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,479
by making sure that the tires

514
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,759
have the right air pressure.

515
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,440
This kind of stuff

516
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,840
affects vehicle in crazy way.

517
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,760
100%.

518
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,440
Amy,

519
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,320
it's fascinating to talk about mobility,

520
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
but even more than that,

521
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,320
I love hearing your insights

522
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,880
along the way.

523
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,400
So, having gone through these experiences

524
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,320
and now I feel that I've gained

525
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,560
a little bit more insight

526
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,960
into the mobility space

527
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,440
and some of the thinking process

528
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,560
that you go through,

529
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:57,119
throughout the years.

530
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,120
But what are some things that

531
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,360
if you were to look back,

532
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,760
you were to tell your younger self,

533
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,240
even whether it's a point in Duke,

534
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,840
or at an MBA with Waze, or Moovit,

535
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,880
what things would you tell yourself?

536
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,200
Yeah. So, I think I've had definitely

537
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,600
a journey with myself

538
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,840
over the last 10 to15 years

539
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,080
of kind of coming into my own,

540
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,840
coming into myself as a leader.

541
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,360
I think that I,

542
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,960
I'm not usually the

543
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,400
oldest person in the room

544
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:34,479
and sometimes the only woman in the room.

545
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,239
I'm definitely not

546
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,480
the loudest one in the room.

547
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,880
And so, it took me a while

548
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,760
to start to understand that those

549
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,600
what makes me different

550
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,440
is actually my superpowers.

551
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,320
And that it's not weaknesses.

552
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,640
And to own that, I mean,

553
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,480
I think I remember so, so clearly

554
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,920
during my MBA,

555
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,200
I studied with Israelis.

556
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,400
When I was in this group of Israeli guys

557
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,520
who'd been in the military,

558
00:16:59,521 --> 00:17:03,559
they have their kind of leadership style.

559
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,559
And I remember the teacher

560
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,879
gave us this assignment.

561
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,200
We had like 15 minutes to work on it.

562
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,960
And so, I read the assignment

563
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,800
and I said to everyone,

564
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,920
"Okay, what do you think?

565
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,640
What do you think?

566
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,520
And what's your input?"

567
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,400
And tried to kind of, keep us on time,

568
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,960
build consensus.

569
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,440
And we got to the end of the 15 minutes.

570
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,040
And then the teacher says,

571
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,080
"Okay. So, who's the leader to present?"

572
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,440
And I turn to the group and I said,

573
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,080
"Who's the leader?"

574
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
And they said to me,

575
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,600
"You're the leader."

576
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,600
And something went off in my mind.

577
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,479
Yeah, I'm the leader.

578
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,079
I'm not just the helper

579
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,400
or the facilitator,

580
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,600
or the supporter.

581
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,960
By engaging everyone,

582
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,520
by getting that consensus

583
00:17:48,521 --> 00:17:50,479
and bringing everyone in,

584
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,079
I'm the leader.

585
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,639
And so, I went home that day and said,

586
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,040
"I'm the leader."

587
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,000
Amazing.

588
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,519
It was a journey for me

589
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,559
to understand my style

590
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,800
and learn how to use it

591
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
and learn how to use it as a superpower.

592
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,760
And what I love about the story is that,

593
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,320
while you're explaining

594
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,720
the environment that where you were

595
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,200
bring together the consensus,

596
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,400
you didn't even mention

597
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,760
if you even said your opinion.

598
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,120
And I think that's one

599
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,680
of the remarkable aspects of leadership.

600
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,000
It doesn't even necessarily to have

601
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,520
the person who speaks the loudest

602
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,960
or is the first to say their opinion,

603
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,280
but the person who is also able

604
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,680
to get the consensus

605
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,440
and hear everybody, and then,

606
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,320
adapt even their own views

607
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,880
after hearing everybody

608
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,680
and putting it all together.

609
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,240
I think that's just wonderful.

610
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,319
Amy, I can't believe 20 minutes

611
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,359
are almost up.

612
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,760
I really enjoyed this episode.

613
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,520
Thank you for being on the show.

614
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,960
Best of luck with Nemodata

615
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,000
and what you're doing there.

616
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,880
I think it's just phenomenal.

617
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,200
And I'm very hopeful

618
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,760
that by the time

619
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,400
that autonomous vehicles will be here,

620
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,320
when I'll be in the vehicle,

621
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,160
I'll know that it's being powered

622
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,720
by the preventive analysis of Nemodata.

623
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,960
But before we leave, Amy,

624
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,200
I need to ask you for three words

625
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,680
that you would use to describe yourself.

626
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:04,960
Sure.

627
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,240
So, I think calm,

628
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,000
calm under pressure.

629
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:10,760
That's definitely one.

630
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,520
Collaborative.

631
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,840
I love working with people,

632
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,760
bringing people together

633
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,680
and getting there,

634
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,960
getting where we're going together.

635
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,760
And curious.

636
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
I love learning new things.

637
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,760
And I try to approach

638
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,640
even the hardest, hardest things

639
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,640
with curiosity,

640
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,520
with kind of a question of

641
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,240
what is it going to feel like

642
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,800
when we do this amazing thing.

643
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,120
I'm sure it's pretty exciting

644
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:40,199
moving from a big company like Gett,

645
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,559
all of a sudden, to a small

646
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,519
early stage startup

647
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,119
that is just getting started properly

648
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,439
and being in that court team.

649
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,159
I'm sure it's incredible.

650
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,519
Never boring.

651
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,279
Never boring.

652
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,439
Amy, thank you very much.

653
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,319
Toda raba.

654
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,959
Best of luck - to Gal.

655
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,639
And I can't wait to see

656
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,519
powered by Nemodata

657
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,400
in all the vehicles.

658
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,200
Yeah. Yeah. Think of us. Bye.
