Okay. Shachar Peled, thank you so much for being on my show. How are you? Happy to be here. Wonderful. As you can see in the Galilee right now, so, no complaints. I love it. Covid-19 is horrible. It's horrific. And it's disturbing so many lives. But I have to say that I am thankful that I get to have people like you on the show. People that are so incredibly busy in the day to day. And your response to my request saying, "Well, I'm in quarantine, so we might as well." "Because I have some time now." So, I want to thank you, first of all, for being so generous with your time. Shachar, I have so much to learn over these next 20 minutes. So, I'm really going to go fast and I'm going to cram you with questions. Because there's just so many things that I want to learn. Yes. I'm used to being on the other side. So, I'm ready for your questions. I love it. Okay. So, you're a journalist by profession now. You said multimedia journalist. So, you cover agnostically all different industries. You studied at Columbia University after serving in the elite intelligence units in Israel. Been with CNN, European Correspondent now for Channel 13. But you're also part of the launch team for i24news, right? That's all true. Yes. Amazing. Okay. So, I got that right. But Shachar, now it's your turn. Walk me back through your journey. How do you transition from being a researcher in the intelligence units to being a journalist? Right. So, it was actually a very, it felt very natural the transition. If you think about it, being in intelligence is all about working with sources and writing reports. And working with a tight knit group of people. And what I actually realized I wanted to do is continue that story in order to shed light on various issues, but on a wider basis. So, journalism was a very very natural shift from what I was doing in the military and in the prime minister's office. And I found myself I was debating at 22 as most of us do in Israel. Debating what my path in life will be. And I realized that storytelling and doing it to wide audiences. And unearthing stories that I've never heard about. And have this this wow element to them. But that more than 10 people can read them because they're not top secret. It was what I was meant to do. And I started pursuing that route. So, right after my studies, I worked for Channel two News which was the largest, and still is the largest commercial news channel in Israel. From there, I had the amazing opportunity to be part of this media startup, i24news. The first ever international, multi-language channel in Israel. I personally grew up, my upbringing was in London. So, I had good English. And this channel was looking for English native English speakers, French speakers and Arabic speakers. So, I could get this opportunity to become an [--] correspondent, which I did for about three years. And from then shifted on to life in New York. As you mentioned, my master's in Columbia Journalism School. Which was a ride in its own right. A career in CNN, both New York and in London. Wow. And now I'm usually based in Europe. Right now, quarantined in Israel. But this shift has been a roller coaster and a wonderful ride. Shachar, I want to learn a little bit more about your take on this idea that you're unearthing stories within the IDF and the prime minister's office. You mentioned these are stories that are read by 10 people. And now you're shifting to unearthing stories that are going to be watched by dozens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands. So, talk to me about that shift. And I want to hear a little bit about your take on the responsibility that you hold on unearthing these stories. Because like we just talked before we started, I'm looking at the work that you're doing and I'm saying, "Okay. Well, I'm watching you cover this story." You covered the story of Eritreans in Israel, right? With the protest back then. And I watched that story and it was phenomenal. And then I kept thinking to myself, like, wow, these were amazing five minutes. I learned so much. But there must be another thousand minutes that I didn't hear about, right? And you hold the responsibility of choosing which five minutes to show. So, talk to me a little bit about that responsibility. Right. So, I'll take take you to get quick glimpse of behind the scenes of what's happening really when you do either a print or digital story, and definitely in broadcast. There are hours and hours of footage usually. The more the merrier. You want to try and make a deep dive into anything, any story you encounter. And one of the reasons I became a journalist was to, every day learn new things. And one day be in the kitchen with the chef who's doing these creative things, and the other day being in a [--] zone and uncovering things that happen, that are  breaking news. And the shift from cultural to politics to technology to social issues is so wide and so vast. That I found it fascinating and I still do until this very day. And so, I love doing this deep dive into stories. But you also have a limited amount of time, a limited amount of paper. Digital, not so much. But today you still have to limit the amount of words that you publish. Especially for my generation. The scrolling generation. These are not one minute bites. It's hard to catch our attention. And it's almost there's a conflict of interest that's saying, I want to capture the attention with the clickbait. On the other end, I want to be responsible and say truthful information, right? That's very true. And what you want to do is keep the essence of the story. So, if I'm covering a protest of migrants and asylum seekers or if I'm doing a story about this one specific artist, I'm always looking at what the message it is that I'd like to convey. What the other person, what the story that they're telling is. And I've been very grateful and thankful that I was able to tell some stories that actually create change. And that's what I would like to do personally, as a journalist. There's this I guess, stigma of journalists being objective. There's always this, you can't put your feelings into things. It's no longer the case. When I studied journalism and I personally work that way, I always find that there's something that I want to tell. And there's something that needs to be changed. And I want to be the one to help change that. And especially working for CNN that was prominent when we tell a story that then, as you said, hundreds and thousands of people can see we created change. One of the stories I did that I'm most proud of is highlighting Holocaust survivors that live in poverty in the US. It's a very well-known well covered issue in Israel, [--] being treated. But in the United States of America, the empire of capitalism, if you're poor you're poor and you need to lift yourself up. But when we're talking about Holocaust survivors, most of them over 80, 85 years old. This was surprising to me that they have no structure and no of some kind of institution that is taking care of them from the state, from the federal level. And after doing this story, we've received multiple and multiple calls from individuals, from organizations, from nonprofits who said, "I want to lend a hand." "I want to help." "Can you connect me to these individuals." "I want to do something about this." So, that's just one example of how you, and I spent hours and hours with these people. But the essence was to tell their very specific story in order to get them help or telling other stories awareness, or tell another story that would create some initiative. These are all things that I'm very passionate about. And how do you even uncover these stories? So, growing up as an Israeli in Tel Aviv and now in the Bay Area, I have family that perished in the Holocaust. And I'm very versed in the history of it. But I never even stopped to think that, yes, in the US also we have Holocaust survivors that don't have the structure in this capitalist society that Israel provides, or is aiming to provide currently to Holocaust survivors. How do you go about unearthing these stories and really understanding their value? Because, I mean, part of the idea here is that you are unearthing things that are not mainstream, right? Right. And I was actually very fortunate to be the outsider when I was working in the CNN newsroom in New York specifically. I was the only Israeli, actually, I was the only foreigner. Everyone there was American and our specific department was about 50, 60 people. And that actually allowed me to be the one that brings in these alternative stories. Things that others didn't look at. And it was actually an amazing time. I was at the height of the Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump campaigns. And there was a lot of focus on xenophobia, on the other, on immigrants, on asylum seekers. And in addition to that being a fascinating topic for me, I also found myself thinking is that were different from the regular mindset. And because CNN allowed me this amazing opportunity to just, here's a camera, go out and explore Boise, Idaho, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and all these places I've never heard of. And suddenly I had this opportunity to cover the campaigns there and how people were reacting. There was this whole issue with North Korea, obviously. And then we started interviewing North Korean asylum seekers in the US, which was fascinating. And it was only, because I think I was the outsider that I was looking for these outsider stories. So, that was a great opportunity. That's just incredible. And I mean, are there specific things that you're particularly excited about as you go about, is it the filming of it, the interviewing, the research in the computer, or is it the post-production helping the editors put the story together? Which part of it are you most excited? Oh, that's like choosing between mom and dad. Well, especially in the past couple of years when I've been really just a one woman band, I've been the correspondent, the photographer, the researcher, the producer, it's unfortunately unfortunately only me. So, I'll give you an example. We were in Paris when the Notre Dame was caught on fire and obviously it was a historic and devastating moment. And at that point, obviously, it's just me by chance. I was with my tripod and camera with me and what I needed to do at that moment work in news and I'm on air all the time, I had to do this combination of filming myself, reaching out and asking people and the police, women and men that were there, what was going on. Interviewing, being in touch with the control room. These are all things that the producer, the camera person does, the researcher does and the reporter usually do. Thankfully, my husband was there to help me carry around the tripod here and there. But most of these things I do it by myself and I love it. There's a lot of adrenaline. But I also will admit it's a big challenge. Sometimes, I'm so exhausted by the end of the day that I'm asking myself, "Why do I do this?" But then the following day comes and there's another story to cover. To me, it sounds like you're ready to transition from this to running the control room for a NASA launch. Because it doesn't sound too different at this point. By all means, just give me the control panel, I'll take care of everything. How long does it take from the moment that you understand that there is some potential for something? Yeah. There might be something in Arkansas that we might want to cover. This is interesting to the moment where it actually gets aired to millions of viewers on CNN, and then you get the message across. How long does that process take it? It really depends. So, if you're talking about CNN, again, it's a huge, well oiled machine. They have the resources to just say even we're not sure there's a story there. But here our plane tickets, or a train ride, or a car, or the accommodation that you need, to just there's a story there. There was one murder mystery I did. Driving for like five days through it was Connecticut, Massachusetts, I think a few states there on the northeastern part of the US just to try and chase a story and see if there's this bulk and anything that we can actually create content from. So, it really depends. And this was from one day to the next. Just Shachar, are you ready on Tuesday to take the car and just go on a road trip around these states to see if there's a story. Others it might take time. If we have time to plan ahead and see in advance if we can do one story or another, then we do the planning. Most of the time, it's so different from one day to the next. Now, with Channel 13, as you know, in Israel, everything's last minute. And we can sometimes decide from one hour to the next that I'm on this flight to Germany to cover a story or whatever I need to be across Europe. It sounds exhausting and exhilarating at the same time. Absolutely yes. Yeah. That's true. That's just incredible. And now, looking down at how you operate in different places. And I'm really curious to hear your take on the transition of journalism to the different generations. And I'm even looking at my nieces who are now a few days old, three years and six years old, and the way that they're consuming information, not necessarily news, but any information is drastically different than the way that I'm even consuming it. And so, I'd love to hear a little bit about your take on how journalism is changing and adapting to the younger generations. And I believe you asked this question to the person who ran the BBC News. Right? And I'm especially curious to hear your answer. Well, you did your research. I have a talk with a journalist, I had to prepare a little bit. Right. Very true. I'm very impressed. So, you know the phrase from pixels Ratatouille, "everyone can be a chef" or "everyone can be a cook." These days, I feel like everyone can be a journalist. You need the basic tools and obviously some experience. But with the platforms that exist today to reach everyone and anyone at any time, it's also the danger. And we can spend hours talking about misinformation and disinformation. But it's also an amazing opportunity to spread stories and reach so many people so very quickly. And I look at myself today. I consume news mostly from social media. And I'm not talking only about Facebook or old places where you can add a lot of text and explain the story. Instagram today, Twitter, even TikTok these days, you can learn so much from these platforms in terms of just even getting a new initiative or inspiration from seeing someone doing things and saying, "Hey, that's new." I've never heard or seen anyone do that thing before or ask those questions before. And want to do a story from that or get information from that. And I think anyone who's serious today in news has presence in all of these platforms. Because that's where we get the news. And this is a way to spread news as well. So, without a doubt, social media, TV still exists as as does radio. I can't say that much about print. But everything that has to do with social media today and the platforms know it. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google, all the big digital giants that they know that that's where people consume the news and their information. And that's what they do. They are now putting more more focus on how to use all this information and become a truthful, justifiable news platform. Right. So, I agree. I mean, we can talk for hours about the dangers of misinformation and fake news that come with the democratization of dissemination of information. But what I'm especially curious is, do you believe that 10 years or 15 years from now, we will need reporters to be in front of the Notre Dame in case something happens? Or is it enough that we'll have people holding whatever device they'll use if it won't be already in our glasses and talk while they're watching it? Is there still room for infield journalism in 10, 15 years? If I become a journalist simply by the virtue of me having a phone. I actually thought that you were about to ask me [--] and for that, I have a very quick answer. But for what you are asking, because your question is more interesting. So, just start with the robots. Well, with robots, what we can see today is that, even with the basic levels of AI that we have today, it's not giving us stories. When I go to YouTube and even if you make it better and the aggregation of information will be better, then you won't get the levels of depth and investigation that you want, from what a currently AI can do. And I don't see that improving in 10 years. We can talk about 50. But to answer your question, I think that, yes, anyone can become a journalist. But you have to have the, I think still, it's all about trust. So, you have to have the backing and the the support of some system that people trust. So, you can be an individual and start reporting. And if what you are unveiling is found to be truthful, interesting, knew all the basics and the fundamentals of news, of course, you can become a journalist. Because it's all about practice and experience of how to ask the right questions and how to address. You need that. But very much so in journalism, it's on job training. And I'm saying that someone who has the master's in journalism. Most of what I do right today is not from school. It's from being in the field. And I think, yes, an individual can do that. But it's obviously helpful when you have The New York Times or The New York Herald, The Washington, as not only a support system, but as a way of others to trust you. So, I think in 10 years, that would still be the case. Shachar, this was inspiring. And I learned so much over these past 20 minutes. I want to thank you again for being so generous with your time. Before we finish, I have to ask you the most important question. Three words that you would use to describe yourself. Right. So, I thought very hard on that question because it's very very difficult. So, I guess the first, which is a new word for me, would be mother. Since I have a six month old sunshine. So, and it's not only mother, it's if I cheat a bit, it's being a family person. A family woman. Because it's my dear dear husband, my partner and my son who are now definitely defining myself in my life. The second word would be storyteller. And I don't need to elaborate on that. I think we've done that for 20 minutes now. And the third, what was the third? I think it's difficult because it's trying to describe myself. But it could be, I don't want to cheat, It could be anything from being, You can cheat a little bit. Okay. Thank you. So, anything from being multidisciplinary to just being honest. An honest person. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's a bit bad. But I guess that describes me best. Shachar, toda raba. Thank you very very much. This is inspiring. Enjoy the quarantine. I see that throughout the filming of this episode, it got dark over there. Oh, it did. right. But thank you very very much. And I look forward to continue seeing the stories that you unfold. Thank you so much. It was wonderful. Bye.
