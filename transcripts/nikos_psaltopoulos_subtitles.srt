1
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,320
Nikos Psaltopoulos, Thank you so much

2
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,120
for joining me all the way from Australia.

3
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,970
How are you doing?

4
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,480
Hey, Michael, really good.

5
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,840
It's really good to see you.

6
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,960
Really good to see you.

7
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
Really good to see you too.

8
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,360
How have you been doing this covid?

9
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,480
And you're originally from Greece

10
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,720
now, you're in Australia.

11
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,400
What's happening with you?

12
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,600
It's a bit mixed up, I know.

13
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,440
But we can get there.

14
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,360
So, I started off from here actually.

15
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,280
I'm Melbourne born and raised.

16
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,960
And I moved across to Greece

17
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,520
about three or four years ago now

18
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,960
to do some work with MarineTraffic.

19
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,480
And I came here back to Australia

20
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,880
in Feb.

21
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,240
But I've been locked in

22
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,120
with the lock down ever since.

23
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,520
So, I'm not going anywhere in a hurry.

24
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,560
And look, I'm happy to be back here.

25
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,600
It's a great country,

26
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,120
as you can appreciate.

27
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,160
And I just work remotely.

28
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,840
So, we're making it work.

29
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,800
I love it. I love it.

30
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,380
Okay. Great.

31
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,040
So, over these next 20 minutes,

32
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,960
I'm really excited to talk

33
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
about a variety of things

34
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,920
that we've already started discussing

35
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,560
before we started sharing this episode,

36
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
about this idea

37
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,920
of dealing through adversity,

38
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,400
leading through crisis.

39
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Particularly, also, what you're doing

40
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
with marine traffic.

41
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,400
So, Nikos, I'd love for you

42
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,040
to tell me a little bit

43
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,240
about where you started.

44
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,680
Where your journey took you.

45
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,120
And then we'll transition

46
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,480
off to the entrepreneurial stuff.

47
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,440
Done. Done.

48
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,760
So, I started off doing media.

49
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,280
I'm a journalist by trade.

50
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,000
And I always wanted to be a journo.

51
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,240
And I worked in the media at a time when,

52
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,920
believe it or not,

53
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,440
the Internet was just amazing.

54
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,400
So, we were starting to see back then,

55
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,120
the impact that the Internet

56
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,800
would have on our economy.

57
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,560
Let's pick up exactly where we left off.

58
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,000
So, take me back through your journey

59
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,040
and then we'll transition

60
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,400
to MarineTraffic.

61
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,720
Sure. Always

62
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,640
I've got to say,

63
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,000
it was poetic watching you

64
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,440
walk into the sunset over the bridge there

65
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,200
as you went off towards the alarm.

66
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,920
It was amazing.

67
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,480
It was a beautiful moment.

68
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,960
Okay. So, I started off in the media.

69
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,640
And I work in the media

70
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,600
for about five years.

71
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,000
And it was an amazing experience.

72
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,800
Because I got to cover lots of stories

73
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,920
and really interact with people

74
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,200
from all walks of life.

75
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,360
But it was at a time when,

76
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,080
believe it or not,

77
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,640
the Internet was just starting

78
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,120
to have on media.

79
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,280
It was in the late '90s.

80
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,720
And you could see the landscape

81
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,720
changing very very quickly.

82
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,680
So, I want to do something different.

83
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,600
And one thing I learned very early on

84
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,360
is our ability to be relevant

85
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,000
depends on our ability

86
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,280
to disrupt ourselves.

87
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,000
So, the more often

88
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
we can disrupt our own trajectory,

89
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,760
that ensures greater relevance

90
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,720
in the world and the space

91
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,840
that we find ourselves in.

92
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,960
So, when I wrapped up with media,

93
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,080
I fell into pharmaceuticals.

94
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,960
And I spent 15 years

95
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,780
in the world of Pharma

96
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,320
working for an American

97
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,720
multinational company based in Chicago.

98
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,000
And they were absolutely brilliant.

99
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,240
So, I worked in leadership in pharma

100
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,080
and really understanding

101
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
how to build a business,

102
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,520
how to engage with customers,

103
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,920
strategy, marketing,

104
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,640
all the great things

105
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,960
that they get to learn

106
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,760
from a multinational group

107
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,400
like a huge pharma company.

108
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,640
In the last five years

109
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,880
of my time in pharma,

110
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,440
what I could see, though,

111
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,920
was big corporate business

112
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,600
and the way that it was structured

113
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,400
versus this ecosystem

114
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,800
that was emerging around the world.

115
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,760
This ecosystem that was very

116
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,560
innovative and disruptive.

117
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,480
And I had a really good energy about it.

118
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,520
And almost like an attitude of

119
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,720
anything is possible.

120
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,080
Just watch us and we'll make it happen.

121
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,880
And I was really really attracted to that.

122
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Because what I found was

123
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,040
working for a big company

124
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,040
as good as it was in the initial stages,

125
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,640
that it was slow to move.

126
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,360
And we weren't actually responding,

127
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,560
but we were reacting to change.

128
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,160
And that was a real problem,

129
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,240
as we know now.

130
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,600
So, what I did

131
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,200
in within the last five years,

132
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,320
I discovered co-working

133
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,200
when I was in New York.

134
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,600
I went into one of the original

135
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,840
WeWork spaces in downtown New York.

136
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
There's a story there.

137
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,460
And I thought,

138
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,800
"Great, I could do this in Australia."

139
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,600
So, I launched a couple of

140
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,160
co-working spaces in Australia.

141
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,880
Here in Melbourne.

142
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,720
Yeah. There were very in demand.

143
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,200
So, it was designed to be

144
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,480
quite collaborative.

145
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,760
But what it did as we manage these spaces,

146
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,080
and these spaces grew.

147
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,960
It exposed me to this

148
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,640
it was almost like I was falling

149
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,280
into this black hole of wonderland

150
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,920
of all these startups and tech

151
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,960
and bloggers and vloggers,

152
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,880
and you name it.

153
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,200
People earning income and making a living

154
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,320
in a very different way

155
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,840
to what I had been trained

156
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,920
or accustomed to doing.

157
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,520
And, you know, Michael,

158
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,560
it really excited me and it enthused me.

159
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,240
So, I did that for the last five years.

160
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,440
And obviously that got me

161
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,040
into all these startup events.

162
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,760
I became an ambassador

163
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
for the startup, Grind.

164
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,560
And continue throwing myself

165
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,840
into the startup community.

166
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,680
Understanding how it worked

167
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,680
and the opportunity

168
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,800
that existed in the world

169
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,240
that was changing super super fast.

170
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,160
And all I knew was that

171
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,400
I didn't want to miss out.

172
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,880
I wanted to be part of the change.

173
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,080
I wanted to be part of the world.

174
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,560
I didn't want to be irrelevant.

175
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,400
And not being irrelevant meant,

176
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,280
constantly getting out of my comfort zone

177
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,760
to learn new things and challenge myself

178
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,920
and feel uncomfortable

179
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,720
more so often than not.

180
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Wow. Okay.

181
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,080
So, you're starting off

182
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,520
all the way in media.

183
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,840
You're finding yourself

184
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,720
in pharmaceuticals,

185
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,360
in a big company realizing that

186
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,000
there's all these great changes

187
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,360
and a big company might be

188
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,920
maybe slow to move.

189
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,120
And you've transition all of a sudden

190
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,320
to co-working spaces

191
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,880
and starting co-working spaces

192
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,120
in Australia.

193
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,240
And you're getting exposed

194
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
to all these startups.

195
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,000
So far, correct?

196
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,240
So far, [--]

197
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,560
Startup grind, and now you realize,

198
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,200
okay, your passion lies

199
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,000
in seeing these changes unfold,

200
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,200
dealing through these adversities

201
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,800
and discovering new realms.

202
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,040
How do you find yourself then

203
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,880
in marine technology in MarineTraffic?

204
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,800
Yeah, it's crazy.

205
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,320
It's been an amazing ride.

206
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,400
So, I did brief stint

207
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,520
with the health tech startup

208
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,840
here in Melbourne.

209
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,920
And whilst I was doing that,

210
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,960
I was given the chance to do

211
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,400
head of sales innovation role

212
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,200
for a fashion brand,

213
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,440
which I've never done before.

214
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,320
And it was an amazing experience.

215
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,120
But when I left that,

216
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,960
I started my own consultancy.

217
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,800
I really wanted

218
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,480
to do something for myself.

219
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,480
And whilst travelling, being lucky enough

220
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,480
to travel around the world.

221
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,160
Remember these things called aeroplanes

222
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,240
that we can't get into anymore?

223
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,000
I used to basically live and work.

224
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,400
I got to meet the CEO of MarineTraffic.

225
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,720
To be honest, the time I didn't know

226
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,560
a lot about the company.

227
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,120
I had a really good friend of mine

228
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,280
he works in the organization.

229
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,400
And he did say to me this,

230
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,280
"You guys need to get together."

231
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,920
"Because I could see so many commonalities

232
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,600
between the two of you."

233
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,680
And we did get together.

234
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,400
And we had an amazing conversation.

235
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,480
And that conversation spurred some work

236
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,800
that I did for MarineTraffic

237
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,680
as an independent consultant.

238
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,120
And then that resulted with the role

239
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,280
that I'm currently doing now.

240
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,720
And I'm just so super humbled

241
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
to be able to support

242
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,160
an ever growing team

243
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,840
in maritime technology.

244
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,320
And the fact that it's a startup

245
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,400
that emanated from Greece.

246
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,760
At a time when Greece

247
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,680
was in financial turmoil.

248
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,720
I think that in itself

249
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,320
is an amazing story.

250
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,040
Wow. Okay.

251
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,720
So, I hear a lot

252
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,360
about non-linear trajectories

253
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,200
and non-linear paths to career.

254
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,320
I don't know if I've heard

255
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,160
as many that come close

256
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,560
to what you're describing here.

257
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,600
Now, talk to me a little bit

258
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,120
about maritime technology,

259
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,200
marine technology.

260
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,360
And Greece during the economic crisis.

261
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm assuming that you're talking about

262
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,720
looking at 2008 onwards.

263
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,640
And what's happening

264
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,720
with marine technology?

265
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,080
And why are you excited about that now?

266
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,280
So, super excited.

267
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,480
It's an amazing space

268
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,240
like when you consider that 80 to 85%

269
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,520
of all the goods around us

270
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,760
have been transported to us

271
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,560
by a shipping.

272
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,760
Then you quickly understand

273
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,440
the level of depth that shipping has

274
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,320
and the important role that it plays

275
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,920
in our lives.

276
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,960
So, that was one thing.

277
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,240
The technology itself.

278
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,920
Then I learned about the story

279
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,360
of MarineTraffic.

280
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,600
And it started off as a passion project

281
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,240
by our founder, Dimitris Lekkas.

282
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,360
And he's a professor

283
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,600
at Aegean University.

284
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,480
And what he did was

285
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,360
he created the global community,

286
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,480
a global community

287
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,000
of shipping enthusiast.

288
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,280
And what he did, he sent out AIs

289
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,840
transport this around the world

290
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,680
where people place them

291
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,720
in strategic positions.

292
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,760
And then we picked up data.

293
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,680
And that data now became the platform

294
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,640
that is known as MarineTraffic.

295
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,400
Providing different layers of information

296
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,320
to people from all walks of life

297
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,640
every single day.

298
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,920
And critical information.

299
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,960
As we saw the other night

300
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,480
with the explosion in Beirut, in Lebanon.

301
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,720
It was MarineTraffic data

302
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,400
that was able to actually piece together

303
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,840
the journey of the ship

304
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,200
that had the components

305
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,520
that caused the explosion.

306
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,480
So, shipping technology

307
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,400
touches on many different parts.

308
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,840
It's the retrospective data that we have.

309
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,200
But it's also the data

310
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,440
that can improve efficiency

311
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,840
in shipping full stop.

312
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,560
And that's really really exciting.

313
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,520
So, are these cases mainly focused

314
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,320
on efficiency and optimization?

315
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,840
Or more about security and knowledge?

316
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,960
Where does the big value lie

317
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,040
in having this data?

318
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,440
All of the above.

319
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,480
All of the above.

320
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,920
Because it's different strokes

321
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,520
for different folks.

322
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,440
And different companies and businesses

323
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,000
have very different needs.

324
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,920
So, we've got to understand that

325
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,200
when it comes to shipping,

326
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,240
it's an industry that for many many years

327
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,680
was actually untouched by technology.

328
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,840
So, the progress that we had seen

329
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,720
in other spaces

330
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,240
didn't exist in this space.

331
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,400
So, all of a sudden,

332
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,200
you've had this massive investment

333
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,640
in shipping technology

334
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,960
that has really changed the way

335
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,880
shipping is and will be forever.

336
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,840
And that's really exciting

337
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,520
to be able to be part of that.

338
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,320
Now, when you're saying

339
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,160
shipping technology,

340
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,520
I'm assuming it's not necessarily

341
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,800
that the ships are changing,

342
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,360
but it's about

343
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,080
how do we monitor these ships.

344
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,800
How do we optimize the space

345
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,640
that we store on these ships.

346
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,760
And how do we decide

347
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,080
which ship takes where,

348
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,520
and what journey they do, right?

349
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,320
Michael, it's a bit of both as well.

350
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,720
Because not only do we have

351
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,640
shipping intelligence

352
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,360
that actually gives us

353
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,440
different layers of data

354
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,120
as to how shipping operates

355
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,240
around the world.

356
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,200
But we're also at the day and age now,

357
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,840
where we're looking at

358
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,800
autonomous shipping.

359
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,160
Shipping without anyone

360
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,880
just basically carrying cargo

361
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,800
around the world.

362
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,840
So, exciting times

363
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,520
that we're living through.

364
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,000
Wait. Are there literally ships

365
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,200
with autonomous ships

366
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,840
that have nobody on them right now?

367
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,240
Yes. So, in testing, yeah.

368
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,400
Absolutely. Absolutely.

369
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,160
It just dawned on me

370
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,480
that this term shipping,

371
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,080
we use it interchangeably now

372
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,560
with any good that is being transferred

373
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,480
from one place to another.

374
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,960
Or we want to ship a product.

375
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,400
But I guess it stems from the fact that

376
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,080
everything is done by ships, right?

377
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,920
You're saying 80 or 85% of the things

378
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,480
are actually done by ships.

379
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,400
So, it's now making a lot of sense.

380
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,560
So, it sounds like

381
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,720
we are in this exciting time

382
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,400
where maritime technology

383
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,840
is becoming more and more relevant

384
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,840
and more startups are going into it.

385
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,440
It sounds to me pretty obvious

386
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,080
that if 80 or 85% of goods

387
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,320
are transferred through ships,

388
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,360
this should have been

389
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,560
one of the first industries

390
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,320
to be able to utilize big data.

391
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,080
But it sounds like

392
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,120
that wasn't necessarily the case.

393
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,720
There weren't many entrepreneurs

394
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,320
going into that field in the first place.

395
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,640
And that's a really good point.

396
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,640
I think maybe there was an eagerness

397
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,760
for entrepreneurs to break in.

398
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,520
But like any industry,

399
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,600
when an industry set in its ways,

400
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,240
it's really hot and it's working,

401
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,480
and it's working for the people

402
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,200
and the key players in that industry,

403
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,840
it's really hard

404
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,360
to really drive the change.

405
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,560
But at some point

406
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,320
something starts to break.

407
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,600
And when it starts to break,

408
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,680
and it's not working as efficiently

409
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,400
as it once did,

410
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,240
that's the catalyst for change.

411
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,440
So, it is probably almost like

412
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,000
a perfect storm at once we know

413
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,640
it was a product market fit

414
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,000
where something wasn't working

415
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,920
and it became apparent.

416
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,800
Then all of a sudden,

417
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
the need for technology in this case

418
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,320
became more real, more relevant.

419
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,120
Wow. Okay.

420
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,160
So, now talk to me a little bit

421
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,480
about dealing with adversity

422
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,120
and dealing with difficulties,

423
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,960
especially through covid.

424
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,840
We mentioned this before,

425
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,600
but I'd love to hear a little bit

426
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,360
about your take

427
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,400
in your leadership journey there.

428
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,920
Okay. It's been an amazing journey

429
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,360
for everyone in the last few months.

430
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,920
And who knows what happens next.

431
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,480
And up until now, though,

432
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,520
as an organization, as a team,

433
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,360
I've got to say,

434
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,680
I'm really proud of the way

435
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,240
we and our team have managed through this

436
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,200
over the last few months.

437
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,280
It's been incredible.

438
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,240
One thing that we did was

439
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,720
it was quite prophetic, actually,

440
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,200
in January, every January,

441
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,000
we have our kickoff summits.

442
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,200
So, we fly in our team

443
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,120
from all over the world

444
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,280
into the heart of Athens

445
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,760
and we have a kick start

446
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,000
to the strategy, marketing,

447
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,200
and time for us to bond and get together.

448
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,800
Wow.

449
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,920
During the last day of this team meeting

450
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,680
that we run, we had a pandemic.

451
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,160
We had H1N1 breakout.

452
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,040
So, about 10 of that team members

453
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,800
got sick during this process.

454
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,240
So, what we then did was in January now,

455
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,400
we have to lock down our offices

456
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,160
to revert obviously the spread.

457
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,920
Now, that was basically a practice run

458
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,040
for what was to come only

459
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,920
like a month and a half later.

460
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,040
And because we were following

461
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,200
the situation from Wuhan,

462
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,560
we're keeping a very close eye

463
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,760
on the situation.

464
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,280
When we could see things

465
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,440
at the tipping point,

466
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,440
just before they took over,

467
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,320
We called it.

468
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,920
We called it.

469
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,520
So, we actually shut our offices down

470
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,320
very very quickly.

471
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,600
We communicated with our team very openly.

472
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,520
And we sent everyone home

473
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,440
as the dispersed team

474
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,720
to work from wherever that leads

475
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,160
anywhere in the world.

476
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,880
And I think taking action early on

477
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
and being on top of it

478
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,560
was really really important.

479
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,720
Particularly because

480
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,680
it's such an unknown, scary situation.

481
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,000
The next thing we did, Michael,

482
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,320
was we called fortnightly meetings.

483
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,040
Which we still do.

484
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,920
We called it routine check ins.

485
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,600
And it's a chance to just get together.

486
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,200
And at times it may not be

487
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,240
anything new to say,

488
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,360
but the fact that we're together

489
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,600
and see each other on screen

490
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,000
and we have a bit of a laugh,

491
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,840
a bit of banter

492
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,000
is really really important.

493
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,400
Because they're the water cooler

494
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,160
conversations that we can no longer

495
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,520
physically have together.

496
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,800
And it's not until

497
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,440
you connect with the team

498
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,560
the way you do remotely,

499
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,120
that you really understand and feel

500
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,000
how much the people that you work with

501
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,280
really mean to you.

502
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,880
And what massive role they play

503
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,920
in each of our lives.

504
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,840
So, having a meetings fortnightly

505
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,520
with the global team

506
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,960
was really really important.

507
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,800
Very quickly as well,

508
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,720
we also from the crisis management team.

509
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,280
And the crisis management team,

510
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,600
which I'm part of as well,

511
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,240
was all about

512
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,520
assessing the situation on a weekly basis.

513
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,960
What are the hotspots.

514
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,720
What are we doing.

515
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,520
What are scenarios

516
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,080
that we should be exploring.

517
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,880
In the scenario planning,

518
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,000
it was really really important

519
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,920
that we kept it very simple.

520
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,760
Because this can play out

521
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,040
in so many different ways.

522
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,080
You get super confusing.

523
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,280
So, we only ever focused

524
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,720
on one, two or three scenarios, max.

525
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,680
And we're usually pretty much

526
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,960
in the right area.

527
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,960
But fundamentally,

528
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,240
apart from all the logistical stuff,

529
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,400
the most important thing

530
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,080
that we were doing

531
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,520
was maintaining human connection.

532
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,240
Maintaining connection through dialogue.

533
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,240
Through conversation.

534
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,600
Through Slack.

535
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,080
Through phone calls

536
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,760
that we have with that team.

537
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,560
Or through Google Hangouts discussions.

538
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,640
And that one on ones.

539
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,960
And maintaining that

540
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,710
even to this day and beyond.

541
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,960
It's something we will continue to do.

542
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,000
It's really really important.

543
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,160
Because people work with people.

544
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,720
People connect with people.

545
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,720
And we as humans give each other

546
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,160
greater purpose and focus.

547
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,960
So, ensuring that people

548
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,240
are feeling safe and secure.

549
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,120
[--]

550
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,920
Huge priorities for us.

551
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,320
But maintaining this,

552
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,000
being able to look at people

553
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,360
and see how they're feeling

554
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,320
and ask them questions

555
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,760
beyond the questions and all that

556
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,360
was super important

557
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,080
and has been a saving grace.

558
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,240
It hasn't been easy.

559
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
It hasn't been easy.

560
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Because even leaders

561
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,760
have their moments as well.

562
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,880
And I read somewhere recently that

563
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,320
the role of leader in the crisis

564
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,400
is to absorb fear and exude hope.

565
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,160
And I really really believe that.

566
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,600
At times, though, even the leader,

567
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,240
can be a little bit shaken.

568
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,840
And I think it's really important

569
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,720
for everyone to hear that

570
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,600
and understand that.

571
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,160
Because at times,

572
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,960
and I'm guilty of that too,

573
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,640
we may put unrealistic expectations

574
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,640
on our leaders

575
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,040
and what our leaders should be doing next,

576
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,960
and what they should know,

577
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,520
and what we expect of them.

578
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,720
And if this situation teaches us anything,

579
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,640
it should teach us a shift in mindset.

580
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,240
A mindset that is more humanistic,

581
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,680
more centralized on heartset

582
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,000
and mindset and connection,

583
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
rather than ego and me.

584
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,880
More about we than me.

585
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,800
I love it. That's just incredible.

586
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,240
By the way, how did the team react

587
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,920
when already a month before

588
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,640
the rest of the world,

589
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,800
you're shutting down?

590
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,000
Essentially, you're doing something

591
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,200
that even in March,

592
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,800
I remember that when I left

593
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,000
Stanford campus in mid-March

594
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,600
and we said,

595
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,480
"Okay. We're coming back in a week or two

596
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,680
after spring break."

597
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,520
And then they said,

598
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,240
"No. You're not."

599
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,600
We were like,

600
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,080
"Wow. This is this is crazy."

601
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,000
"We can't even believe it."

602
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,920
I can only imagine the reaction

603
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,600
that people might have had

604
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,760
back in February or January,

605
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,040
when you're making these decisions.

606
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,680
When the world is still not talking

607
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,440
about covid-19, right?

608
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,680
Well, and maybe I misled you.

609
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,720
So, what we did was

610
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,920
we shut down in January

611
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,440
on the back about our own pandemic

612
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,240
of H1N1 infection within our company.

613
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,480
So, we shut down for about

614
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,240
a week and a half,

615
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,840
but then we really opened.

616
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,240
So, when we monitor the situation

617
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,480
and we could see things

618
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,720
moving very very quickly,

619
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,240
we were able to quickly shut down again

620
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,680
for the second time.

621
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,220
This time because of covid.

622
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,120
Not because of H1N1.

623
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,120
Okay. So, you had that experience

624
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,720
and you were able then

625
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,320
to adapt quickly.

626
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,080
And the team members

627
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,040
already knew the protocol.

628
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,000
So, it was a little bit less

629
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,040
of a shock factor

630
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,720
than perhaps for others.

631
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,080
Moving forward, I mean,

632
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,640
what do you see happening

633
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,840
both with your organization,

634
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,840
but overall in the world

635
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,460
of technology and tech

636
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,120
as you're experiencing it?

637
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,760
Obviously you're in the forefront

638
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,600
as a leader.

639
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,520
Leading a team through this crisis.

640
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,920
You obviously have to prepare now

641
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,800
for years to come,

642
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,640
both in terms of work from home,

643
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,520
but also in terms of

644
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,840
running a company in this new mindset.

645
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,280
So, how are you even approaching this?

646
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,960
Look, that's a really good question.

647
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,680
And it's a very interesting situation

648
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,320
that we all face.

649
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,000
And it's interesting because, Michael,

650
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,120
like we've been accustomed

651
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,800
to instant gratification.

652
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,680
There's a problem. Let's fix it.

653
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,000
We're back to normal.

654
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,280
And I know people

655
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,800
don't want to hear the term,

656
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,040
but we're entering the unknown.

657
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,060
and that's the new normal.

658
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,960
The new normal is to totally expect

659
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,160
the unexpected.

660
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,160
And I think about generations before us

661
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,440
who've gone through real hardship,

662
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,720
through wars, through famine,

663
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,840
through difficult life changing events.

664
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,600
And what those events

665
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,080
taught them at the time

666
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,400
was resilience.

667
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,880
And the power to be able

668
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,200
to have a sense of perspective

669
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,080
and move on step by step.

670
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,360
Our generation right here, right now,

671
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,680
we want instant gratification.

672
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,720
Okay, covid. Let's get over it.

673
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,280
Let's move on.

674
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,080
Let's get back to how we were.

675
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,040
Firstly, I think

676
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,280
that's a waste of a crisis.

677
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,080
A total waste of the crisis.

678
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,280
If we're yearning to go back

679
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,240
to what we were,

680
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,920
I could think of nothing worse.

681
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,480
Like, we've learned something.

682
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,720
We've gained something.

683
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,000
So, let's redesign it.

684
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,640
Let's rethink it.

685
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,800
Let's move on to something

686
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,680
that could be better than what it was.

687
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,880
But it's human nature

688
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,080
to feel safe and secure.

689
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,280
To gravitate to what makes us

690
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,400
feel safe and secure.

691
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,640
And that is the past.

692
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,280
But in this case, we need to let it go.

693
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,400
Because, as you said,

694
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,880
and I totally agree with you,

695
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,040
what we're experiencing

696
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,360
is not going to last for a few months.

697
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,280
It will last for a number of years

698
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,280
if we're lucky, if we're lucky.

699
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,720
So, what do I think will happen?

700
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,760
When you consider the mumps,

701
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,800
And a funny thing, that mumps,

702
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,240
it took them four years

703
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,600
to develop the vaccine

704
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,760
for it to go to market.

705
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,080
And that was the whole world

706
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,800
working together

707
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,840
to actually develop a vaccine.

708
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,920
Now, that was in the '60s.

709
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
Admittedly, we've moved on

710
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,680
in leaps and bounds

711
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,200
in terms of tech and science and pharma

712
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,800
since then, I get it.

713
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,680
But we still need to go

714
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,440
through four phases of trials,

715
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,760
which includes human testing

716
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,240
at the end of it

717
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,040
before we even have a vaccine.

718
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,720
So, let's not wait

719
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,880
for that silver bullet to come.

720
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,480
Instead, let's redesign our own pathway.

721
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,640
So, companies like Google and Uber,

722
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,960
as we know, have already announced

723
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,360
a work remote plan

724
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,040
at least until June, July 2021.

725
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,880
So, firstly, I think it's really important

726
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,080
to be able to give your team, a company,

727
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,240
a bit of a timeline.

728
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,400
A bit of an understanding that,

729
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,160
"Hey, this isn't going to be

730
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,040
quickly fixed."

731
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
"That we're going to need time."

732
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,680
"And in that time,

733
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,760
all we can ask is a constant flow

734
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,200
of open and honest,

735
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,760
transparent communication."

736
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,000
People feel unsafe.

737
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,240
People lose their balance

738
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,040
when the communication stops.

739
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,560
And even if there's nothing new to say,

740
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,880
like I said earlier,

741
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,320
there's nothing new to say,

742
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,760
maintaining that communication

743
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,440
is really important.

744
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,080
So, for us, we have a plan

745
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,000
over the next few months.

746
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,080
And what we're doing,

747
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,320
we're monitoring the situation

748
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,560
that I mentioned earlier.

749
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,400
And in September, we're getting together

750
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,760
a crisis management team,

751
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,040
and we'll assess the situation at the time

752
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,920
to make a decision

753
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,400
as to what we need to do

754
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,080
between September and December.

755
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,920
Having said that, our summit for 2021,

756
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,680
is in January again,

757
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,000
and it'll probably be virtual.

758
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,280
So, we're planning a virtual summit

759
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,360
and we're excited to be doing that.

760
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,320
But you know what?

761
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,000
There's opportunity in that.

762
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,840
Because we've reached out

763
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,800
to some amazing global speakers

764
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,680
that ordinarily,

765
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,040
we would not have access to.

766
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,160
So there's always new opportunity.

767
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,440
Now, the other thing

768
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,320
that I just want to mention

769
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,400
is the mental health challenge

770
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,760
that we all face

771
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,320
during this time of quarantine

772
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,000
and isolation,

773
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,960
feeling the way that we're feeling.

774
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,000
One of the things that we did

775
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,160
very early on this year

776
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,960
is we employ a full time psychologist

777
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
in our team.

778
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,160
Really?

779
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,760
Yeah. And she's an MT coach.

780
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,720
And every single one of our team members

781
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,040
has unlimited access to our MT coach

782
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,400
whenever he or she need to have a chat.

783
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,480
Whether it's personal,

784
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,200
or professional.

785
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,480
She's there. We're there to help together

786
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,120
with our people operations.

787
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,480
That's just remarkable.

788
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,080
I just, I'm so inspired

789
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,040
by your take on it.

790
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,120
And the excitement that you're bringing

791
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,800
to the table with this change and saying,

792
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,920
"Yes, we have this issue

793
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,760
that we don't know what's happening."

794
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
"It's really problematic."

795
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,280
"But we're extremely excited about

796
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,400
the different opportunities

797
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,800
that it present and we're always looking

798
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,840
at the upside of it."

799
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,520
So, I think that's just

800
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,400
a remarkable way to go.

801
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,960
And I can only imagine

802
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,320
that everybody who works with you

803
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,000
in this company,

804
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,760
can only feel the same excitement

805
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,200
for dealing with this adversity

806
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,760
and dealing with the challenges.

807
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,960
And the fact that I agree

808
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,840
that knowing the timeline

809
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,240
and having these expectations.

810
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,520
And already planning

811
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,920
a virtual summit for next year,

812
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,800
I'm sure that it gives

813
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,920
some sort of confidence

814
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,000
to the team that saying,

815
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,280
"Well, we know some things."

816
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,080
"We don't know a lot of things."

817
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,040
"But our leadership is guiding us

818
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,120
towards some reality

819
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,680
that we can be confident."

820
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,120
And I think that's wonderful.

821
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,000
Nikos, before we leave,

822
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,560
I have to ask you

823
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,600
for my favorite question.

824
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,880
Three words that you would use

825
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,720
to describe yourself.

826
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,240
Sure, Done. All right.

827
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,880
Okay. I think first and foremost,

828
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,520
empathetic.

829
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,600
I feel joy, I feel pain.

830
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,800
I feel what you're feeling.

831
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,120
And that gives me

832
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,600
a real heightened sense of experience.

833
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,360
And I love that

834
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,920
because it really aides with connection.

835
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,560
So, definitely empathetic.

836
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,200
I'm super super curious.

837
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,400
I always want to learn and throw myself

838
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,000
into the most challenging situations.

839
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,320
People who know me very well go like,

840
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,000
"You're crazy. You're crazy."

841
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
"How can you do that?"

842
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
But I do it.

843
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,560
I do it because I'm curious.

844
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,760
And I think that also leads

845
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,400
into being adventurous.

846
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,960
I love adventure.

847
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,920
I love throwing myself into a plane

848
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,960
and going to countries

849
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,200
that I've never been to before.

850
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,160
Not knowing a single soul

851
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,160
and then walking away

852
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,480
with amazing best mates with me for life.

853
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,360
So, I think those three words

854
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,800
to describe me.

855
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,400
Nikos, thank you very very much.

856
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,280
This was inspiring.

857
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,840
I enjoyed it so so much.

858
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,960
Best of luck with everything.

859
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,520
And I look forward

860
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,400
to continue watching the company grow

861
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:51,960
and watching

862
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,520
your non-linear career proceed.

863
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,840
Because it just it's remarkable.

864
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,360
Thank you very much.

865
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,080
Thank you, Michael.

866
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,800
Thank you.

867
00:32:59,800 --> 00:35:45,200
Take care.
