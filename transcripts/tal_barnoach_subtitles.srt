1
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,680
Tal Barnoach, thank you so much

2
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,360
for being on my show,

3
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,120
20 Minute Leaders.

4
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,400
How are you?

5
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,760
Good.

6
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,320
Thank you for having me.

7
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,640
Where are you calling from right now?

8
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,800
From my office in Herzliya.

9
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,520
Wonderful

10
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,360
And how is everything over there

11
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,880
with the whole covid situation

12
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,960
and all the protests that are happening?

13
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,200
There is tense.

14
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,440
But in terms of covid,

15
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,720
there were 1,500 cases per day.

16
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,920
There is about 380 in hospitals

17
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,880
that are in more difficult situations.

18
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,760
They're trying to manage it

19
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,200
and to take the numbers down.

20
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,920
Hopefully by September 1st,

21
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,200
when kids are going back to school,

22
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,640
it's going to be much better than now.

23
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,320
Definitely.

24
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,800
Definitely.

25
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,120
And I have to say that

26
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,000
while you hear about covid all the time,

27
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,160
one of the things that I'm really curious

28
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,480
and I'm very excited about,

29
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,400
for this conversation specifically,

30
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,880
is to talk about your journey.

31
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,960
You're currently running

32
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,840
Disruptive Ventures.

33
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,920
But you have a long history

34
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,920
in the tech industry,

35
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,320
all the way from your days

36
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,400
in the intelligence forces,

37
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,720
moving on to creating your own companies.

38
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,120
And being a serial entrepreneur.

39
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,760
I believe you were in some caliber,

40
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,000
another a part of the three,

41
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,560
or four acquisitions, which is just,

42
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,280
I'm sure there's phenomenal stories

43
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,880
from there.

44
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,680
But then moving on

45
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,320
to becoming an angel investor,

46
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
now a VC.

47
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,920
And you're on nine different boards.

48
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,320
Tal, I have no idea how you do this.

49
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,280
One of them

50
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,520
is one of my favorite companies,

51
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,200
Tailor Brands.

52
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,240
I'm completely inspired

53
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,400
about what Yali and the team

54
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,160
are doing over there.

55
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,360
So, I love seeing

56
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,760
that you're on their board.

57
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,080
But Tal, let's start easy.

58
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,200
Just give me a little bit of background

59
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,440
about your journey.

60
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,200
Who are you?

61
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,560
Like, why did you do all these things?

62
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,160
It's a great question.

63
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,800
Well, so you know, in Israel,

64
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,720
you have to serve in the army

65
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,120
at the age of 18.

66
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
It's compulsory.

67
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,880
So, I did the first few years

68
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,400
from 18 up to 22.

69
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,760
And then obviously in the reserve.

70
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,400
In the Army, I was

71
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,440
in a special intelligence unit.

72
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,560
You can't really talk a lot about it.

73
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,280
But I can say that that was the first time

74
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,560
where someone gave me a real chance.

75
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,320
Because I was pretty junior.

76
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:04,240
And at the age of between 20, 21,

77
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,360
the head of the unit

78
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,160
called me one day and said,

79
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,960
"There is a guy here that he's rank

80
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,680
about three, four ranks above you,

81
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,880
from tomorrow morning

82
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
you're replacing him."

83
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,920
Which was shocking to me.

84
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,760
And I was not prepared.

85
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,440
I had basically the weekend

86
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:33,240
to mentally and get ready for a new job.

87
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,720
And it was probably Thursday.

88
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,920
And on Sunday, I got in.

89
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,360
I have to manage a lot of people

90
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,000
in very very tough environment

91
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,880
in this unit, in many places.

92
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,700
Tal, I do have to say,

93
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,680
it's something that keeps coming up.

94
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,120
And I believe I heard it first

95
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,400
when Eric Schmidt talked about it,

96
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,080
I think maybe eight years ago

97
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,160
at a conference in Tel Aviv.

98
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,720
And he was talking about this magic

99
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,960
of the startup nation.

100
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,040
That part of it is really this idea that,

101
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,400
at 18 years old,

102
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,640
we entered this army and I'll never forget

103
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,800
coming to the boot camp

104
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,800
and being handed and I'm 16.

105
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,280
And then going through rigorous training

106
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,720
on how to be responsible with it.

107
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,120
And I thought, and I was so confused

108
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,440
that at 18 years old

109
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,600
were given such responsibility.

110
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,960
And the person who was teaching me

111
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,160
how to handle my life responsibly

112
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,640
is a 19 year old

113
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,360
who is just six months above me.

114
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,120
So, what you're talking about,

115
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,320
I think it really resonates.

116
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,600
And that feeling of responsibility

117
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,400
and getting those opportunities

118
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,280
are really remarkable.

119
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,960
But then, how do you transition

120
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,400
from your experience in the IDF onwards

121
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,040
to then, to the real life,

122
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,480
to the startup life?

123
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,320
So, I decided after

124
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,080
that I went to university.

125
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,480
And then I wanted to do my MBA in the US.

126
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,760
And I went to US to get interviewed

127
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,360
in a few good universities.

128
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,680
And then I got a call from someone

129
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,960
that said that he heard about me.

130
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,960
And if I'm willing to come back to Israel

131
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,280
instead of doing my MBA

132
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,160
and start working in manufacturing plant

133
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,280
in the north side of the country.

134
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,640
That at that time was very unique

135
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,440
with unique technology and so forth.

136
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,040
And he said,

137
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,960
"You will make 2,000 shekel."

138
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,160
Which is equivalent today of $600.

139
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,440
Right.

140
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,000
This is what you're going

141
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,560
to make at first.

142
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,680
But if you'd be good

143
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,440
and what I heard about you is true

144
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,520
and you'll be able to gain both experience

145
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,960
and to go up in terms of your salary.

146
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,800
And I decided to come back to Israel.

147
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,520
And I was going five years old every day

148
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,680
from here, Herzliya, Ramat Hasharon

149
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,040
to the north side, which is Karmiel.

150
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,840
So, that's like an hour and a half.

151
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,760
Each one hour 45 minutes each way.

152
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,800
To be exact.

153
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,120
Tal, why did you do this?

154
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,760
In comparison,

155
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,040
any people who are watching this,

156
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,320
and obviously these are maybe

157
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,920
different times,

158
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
but it can't be that great of a gap.

159
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,120
Because today,

160
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,280
I enter Stanford in freshman year.

161
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,760
The first question that they ask you is,

162
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,040
"Where do you do your internship

163
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,720
in the summer?"

164
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,640
The second question is,

165
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,960
"How much money are you making?"

166
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,360
One of the greatest pieces of advice

167
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,040
that I've been hearing

168
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,440
is follow your curiosity, not the money.

169
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,200
Because the money will follow.

170
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,320
And I think that that's where

171
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,440
you're alluding to as well.

172
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,600
But I'm thinking, I'm seeing my friends

173
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,840
who are making $6,000

174
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,680
for a summer internship per month.

175
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,160
And you're talking about $600.

176
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,000
Why did you choose

177
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,570
to go to that route?

178
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,960
Because I thought that there is

179
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,680
an amazing opportunity.

180
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,560
I knew that if I will show

181
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,760
that I'm good at what I'm doing,

182
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,560
then I'll be able to go up

183
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,760
and to show them

184
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,240
that I can manage the process.

185
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,760
And yeah, the after five year,

186
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,280
I was making three times

187
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,920
all of my friends what they did.

188
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,960
And I was number two in the company,

189
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,680
and number one [--].

190
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,520
And the company went public.

191
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,000
And then I came to the CEO,

192
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,200
which was the one of the owners.

193
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,280
And I told him,

194
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,160
after we went public, I said,

195
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,560
"Who is going home?"

196
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,120
"You or me?"

197
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,080
So, I was young.

198
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,240
He told me,

199
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,040
"If I wasn't part of the family,

200
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,480
I will go and you should take it."

201
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,560
"But I'm part of the family."

202
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,920
"I can't go anywhere."

203
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,560
"But I really want you to stay."

204
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,960
"I'm willing to offer you

205
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,000
anything you can think about."

206
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,040
But I said,

207
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,160
"No no. I want to be entrepreneur."

208
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,000
"And this time for me to go."

209
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,880
So, I was staying there

210
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,200
for another nine months,

211
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,600
and then I left.

212
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,440
Before you continue

213
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,640
to the next part of the journey,

214
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,240
I want to go back.

215
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,800
When you mentioned first

216
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,920
when you joined the specter,

217
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,320
you talked about the fact

218
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,720
that they have this unique technology

219
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,400
and that it was

220
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,760
an interesting opportunity.

221
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,280
You forwent a big life decision

222
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,080
going to the US, going to do an MBA

223
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,440
to go and work at a factory

224
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,320
in the north of Israel.

225
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,560
This is irregular by any means,

226
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,000
at any point in time.

227
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,360
How big a factor was your curiosity

228
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,800
in driving the technology that was there

229
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,720
or the actual job that you're going to do?

230
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,200
Or was it primarily this idea

231
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,640
that you felt

232
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,760
this could be a good stepping stone

233
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,400
to become a leader in this company?

234
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:14,040
So yeah. It's I think, it's all of it.

235
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,240
But the first was,

236
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,120
I believe that I can do an impact there.

237
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,840
Second, that if I'll do the right job,

238
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,680
I know that I can become senior

239
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,960
in a position.

240
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,280
And third, I said to myself,

241
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,720
the experience that I will gain there

242
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,560
is unmatched, and for me,

243
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,840
the experience was really important.

244
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,480
I love it.

245
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,960
I love it.

246
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,840
Okay. So, I'm already taking

247
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,400
a lot of inspiration from that.

248
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,760
And you decide that's just the beginning

249
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,560
of your career in terms of actually

250
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,640
hands on work.

251
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,480
You then go and you work

252
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,240
at a few other startups.

253
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,800
But I want to make sure

254
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,640
we also leave time

255
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,840
to talk a little bit

256
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,360
about your take today.

257
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,640
So, walk me through, now, your transition.

258
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,760
I'll walk you now fast.

259
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,400
The first company is entrepreneur.

260
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,360
It was in the multimedia area

261
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,920
before the Internet.

262
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,680
And with the Israeli chutzpah,

263
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,120
we went to the

264
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,720
International Olympic Committee,

265
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,120
the IOC and to the NBA.

266
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,080
It was Juan Antonio Samaranch,

267
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,240
the IOC president,

268
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,320
and David Stern, the NBA commissioner.

269
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,960
And we got exclusive worldwide rights

270
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:37,600
for all the Olympics and NBA media.

271
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,720
Why the Israeli chutzpah?

272
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,880
Explain to me that part.

273
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,680
Because two guys out of nowhere

274
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,800
going to convince these guys

275
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,000
that we are the partners

276
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and we are going to do a much better job

277
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,680
than Microsoft and anyone else.

278
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,880
And after eight, nine months

279
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,440
of negotiation,

280
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,040
that literally we had no money whatsoever,

281
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,000
we were sleeping like in small motels,

282
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,680
in different places.

283
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,840
But we came to the meetings with suits

284
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,960
and everything was like.

285
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,520
I love that.

286
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,520
We had to do the show.

287
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,800
So, every time we can,

288
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,240
we show them

289
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,440
that we are an amazing

290
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,200
and might be a big company

291
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,860
and so forth,

292
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,720
when we didn't have

293
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,280
20 bucks in our pocket.

294
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,200
That's beautiful. Wow.

295
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,320
I remember once that we had to,

296
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,440
they called us for immediate meeting.

297
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,720
It was in Rosh Hashanah,

298
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,520
which is the most important holiday,

299
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,920
one of the most important holidays

300
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,560
in Israel and we had to go to Switzerland

301
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,680
and to stay there over for the holiday,

302
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,080
not with the family and so forth.

303
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,920
So, I think that one thing

304
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,720
that is coming out of all of it,

305
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,800
is the commitment.

306
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,480
That once you are committed

307
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,440
to the process, to the project,

308
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,480
to the company, as a founder,

309
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,000
it's a really significant part

310
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,880
of your life and of your success.

311
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,480
How do you measure that today

312
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,960
when you're running Disruptive Ventures

313
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,400
and you're looking

314
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,680
at really great entrepreneurs,

315
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,840
but you're obviously seeing

316
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,280
both the good and the bad.

317
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,920
And I'm guessing that through this lesson,

318
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,840
one of the things you're looking for

319
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,920
is this commitment level, right?

320
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,800
This engagement.

321
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,000
Absolutely. And I'm telling

322
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,080
those entrepreneurs

323
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,120
that coming to me every day, I'm saying,

324
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:42,400
"Guys, you're going to 10 to 12 years

325
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,640
commitment to a company

326
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,920
that you're going to live, breath."

327
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,760
"All of your life

328
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,440
is going to be around it."

329
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,320
"It's going to be a much less family time,

330
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,000
less friends time."

331
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,560
That's all of that.

332
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,280
But I'm saying that

333
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,520
if it's really into you,

334
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,400
it's in your body, and you decided

335
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,000
that you're going to do it,

336
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,320
nothing will stop you.

337
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,800
And I felt it as entrepreneur.

338
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,840
And I know today

339
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,240
that when I see those guys

340
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,520
that are coming

341
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,860
with the eyes open like this

342
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,760
and they talk about their ideas,

343
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,880
and you see the passion and the energy

344
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,000
and everything else,

345
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,840
you know that you have someone

346
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,920
that you can go with.

347
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,200
So, obviously, one of the big tasks

348
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,560
that that you're faced with

349
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,640
is to differentiate between

350
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,400
artificial passion or theatrical passion

351
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,640
with the real intrinsic passion.

352
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,520
Because I'm guessing especially,

353
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,080
around the world,

354
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,800
a lot of accelerators

355
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,480
and a lot of startup schools,

356
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
they teach you how to pitch

357
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,040
and they teach how to present.

358
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,560
And now with my head on

359
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,240
as a senior associate at J-Ventures,

360
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,400
as I'm examining

361
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,160
different early stage startups,

362
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,120
a lot of times I ask myself,

363
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,440
are these people really passionate

364
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,040
about what they're doing

365
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,240
or do they feel like

366
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,000
they're in a Y combinator demo day

367
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,040
that they have to go and scream at me.

368
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,560
Right?

369
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,720
So, is that all intuition?

370
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,280
Or how do you go about and measure

371
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,160
whether somebody is really ready

372
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,400
to make that commitment?

373
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,120
It's you have to meet them

374
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,120
again and again and again.

375
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,360
Right.

376
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,480
And to ask all the questions

377
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,840
that you think that are relevant

378
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,000
to coming from this way,

379
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,920
coming from this way.

380
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,640
And you have to understand.

381
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,960
You have a picture

382
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,240
that you're trying to understand,

383
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,080
the commitment, the level of commitment.

384
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,760
How excited are they about it

385
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,720
and how long they're willing to go

386
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,760
with their passion and dream.

387
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,480
Because if you don't have it,

388
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,960
I think it's the odds

389
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,440
of successful startups

390
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,240
are against those who are starting it.

391
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,800
The statistics.

392
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,720
So, if you don't have the passion

393
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,680
and the energy and everything else,

394
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,520
the odds are much less.

395
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,360
So, you need to have so many things,

396
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,200
so many ingredients into the equation

397
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,480
that the startup will be successful.

398
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,080
That you need to bring some of it

399
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,520
in terms of your body language,

400
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,680
your energy, your passion,

401
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,480
the way you describe it,

402
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,600
and then it will help you.

403
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,600
So, Angel Investments, they sound great.

404
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,440
I get to talk

405
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,520
to quite a few angel investors

406
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,160
and it seems like it's living the life,

407
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,560
working out of coffee shops

408
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,040
and meeting great entrepreneurs.

409
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,360
Why form a VC?

410
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,400
Why form Disruptive Ventures?

411
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,000
And what is Disruptive Ventures?

412
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,640
What is the mission there?

413
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,120
So, Disruptive.

414
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,160
We started Disruptive because,

415
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,040
so I was entrepreneurial and then angel,

416
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,280
and then I started Disruptive.

417
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,120
And Disruptive, I said to myself that

418
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,760
there is a vacuum

419
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,600
between the seed stage and round A.

420
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,480
We called it seed plus.

421
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,880
I heard many talk about this.

422
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,120
It's like the power seed round.

423
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,840
That people need this extra. Yeah.

424
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,240
And in Israel at the time,

425
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,680
there was no scale between there.

426
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,440
So, what was happening

427
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,600
when I started Disruptive,

428
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,880
there was so many companies

429
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,520
that got seed money

430
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,960
but couldn't go up to the A-round

431
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,480
because they left with no money

432
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,360
after the half a million dollars

433
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,600
to a million dollars they got.

434
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,840
And then they was not ready

435
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,560
for the A-round.

436
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,320
So I said, I will tackle this place

437
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,600
between the seed and the round A.

438
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,200
And I will invest in those companies.

439
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,160
Will give them the

440
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,720
one to two million dollars

441
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,680
to help them go to the A-round.

442
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,560
So, that was the thesis behind it.

443
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,680
Why Disruptive?

444
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,480
Because I really believe

445
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,720
that the Israeli entrepreneurs

446
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,600
have to come with disruption,

447
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,880
ideas, technologies, products,

448
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,280
business model and so forth,

449
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,840
to compete with all

450
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,720
of the global companies out there.

451
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,200
Whether they are in Silicon Valley,

452
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,760
in the East Coast, in Europe,

453
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,320
in Asia and so forth.

454
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,760
Because we are nine million people country

455
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,600
and we have to think global

456
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,360
from the get go.

457
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,120
If you don't come

458
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,480
with the real disruption,

459
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,920
if you don't change

460
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,240
the way people consume product,

461
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,520
work with product,

462
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,000
come with innovation,

463
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,600
do something that is really different,

464
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,800
it will be very difficult to compete

465
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,280
those companies there.

466
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,680
I love it.

467
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,400
By the way, Tal, just to make sure

468
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,560
that when you're talking about

469
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,000
that the stage where you are investing,

470
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,880
are you just adding on to the seed round

471
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,320
or are you a bridge round

472
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
between the seed and series A generally?

473
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,520
Sometimes I will write the seed check.

474
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,880
But it will be a bigger check

475
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,840
than the usual one.

476
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,920
And sometimes it will be the bridge

477
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,240
between the seed and round A.

478
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,920
I'm now doing my third fund,

479
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,960
which called disruptive AI.

480
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,000
Which is the junction between disruption

481
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,160
and AI technology.

482
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,800
I brought a new team

483
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,800
to help me with disruptive AI.

484
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:32,280
Adi, was the second in command in 8200.

485
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,960
Gadi, that was a general partner in JVP.

486
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,120
And professor [--]

487
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,520
from Bar-Ilan University,

488
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,880
which have the biggest AI lab

489
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,040
in the country.

490
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,280
So, we formed a group of people

491
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,400
that will do investments in the junction

492
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,520
between disruption and AI,

493
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,720
which I think it's the way to go

494
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,600
when you move forward.

495
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,120
When you look at the next 10 years,

496
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,880
AI is going to be a very important

497
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,400
part of our life in general.

498
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,440
For the things that we're going to do,

499
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,440
behave and so forth.

500
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,600
And the fact that now

501
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,000
because of big data

502
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,880
and because of you can

503
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,360
really get a lot of information

504
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,840
that you couldn't get before,

505
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,640
it's really helping you

506
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,720
to form those companies.

507
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,880
So, we're really excited about it.

508
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,440
100%. And Tal,

509
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,840
we have just a few minutes.

510
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,720
But I have to get your input.

511
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,560
You're a board member

512
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,000
of eight or nine companies right now.

513
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,960
Which I have no idea

514
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,360
how you're juggling all those.

515
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
Give me your two cents

516
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,480
about the responsibilities

517
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,440
of being a board member.

518
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,480
What do you enjoy most

519
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,080
about this experience?

520
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,120
Or what is your responsibility

521
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,400
as a board member there?

522
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,200
So, I'll be very honest here.

523
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,240
And I know that I'm a bit different

524
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,400
from other people.

525
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,960
Board is not important.

526
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,600
Okay.

527
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,160
What is important is the work

528
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,160
that you do with the entrepreneur,

529
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,440
all year long, every month,

530
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,760
every week, every day.

531
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,280
Board is a summary

532
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,800
of what's happening up to now

533
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,880
and what you forecast for the future.

534
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,920
But we work with the entrepreneurs

535
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,720
all the time.

536
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,640
So, I know before the board

537
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,520
what will be in the board meeting.

538
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,200
I want to prepare myself

539
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,680
for this board meeting.

540
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,720
And I think that, I'm always saying that

541
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,880
because I work with young entrepreneurs,

542
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,240
you mentioned Yali.

543
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,400
But there is Yali and David

544
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,440
and Danielle and all of those guys.

545
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,600
I'm a psychology.

546
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,400
I'm just not charging for it.

547
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,600
I love it.

548
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,560
So, those guys are coming to me

549
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,600
all the time.

550
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,240
And they have problems here

551
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,480
and they have problems there.

552
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,480
And it's a roller coaster.

553
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,760
And one day they think

554
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,280
that they're the next Google.

555
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,840
And the day after, Oh, my God,

556
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,240
they going bust.

557
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,040
And you need to really be helpful for them

558
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,400
and understand what, where they are.

559
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,480
And give them a hug.

560
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,000
And when you need to be tough, be tough.

561
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,280
But really, I think that

562
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,000
it's the whole enchilada

563
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,880
that you're really supporting them

564
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,680
and giving them your help

565
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,240
and empathy and sympathy

566
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,680
to help them really go

567
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,680
through the tough times.

568
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:45,920
The board is the other side of it.

569
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,960
Means that you really come

570
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,640
to a two hours meeting,

571
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,600
[--] with people.

572
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,400
You get the summary from the company.

573
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,080
You decide where you're going.

574
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,920
You help them lead the next quarter or so.

575
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,720
But I think the really important work

576
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,960
is what you do in between

577
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,130
and not those.

578
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,560
Tal, completely inspiring.

579
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,400
I just love it.

580
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,280
But before we leave,

581
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,200
and by the way,

582
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,640
I have to mention that I can't wait

583
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,440
to share with you a slide

584
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,640
that hopefully in the coming years,

585
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,000
as I go on my own entrepreneurial journey.

586
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,800
But before that,

587
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,200
I need three words from you.

588
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,080
Three words that you would use

589
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,960
to describe yourself,

590
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,760
or that any of your founders

591
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,000
that work with you on the day to day

592
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,920
would describe you as.

593
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:34,120
Focused.

594
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,720
Okay.

595
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,120
Persistent.

596
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:47,080
And friendship.

597
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,040
Focused, persistent and friendship.

598
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,880
I love it. And obviously I didn't give you

599
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,800
time to prepare,

600
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,400
but I think that those three words

601
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,880
are already exuding

602
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,520
through the whole conversation

603
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,080
that we had.

604
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,600
So, Tal, I want to thank you again

605
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,760
for your generous time.

606
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,440
And I know how busy you are.

607
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,680
I think you have about nine board meetings

608
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,480
to attend to now.

609
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,200
And more companies to invest in.

610
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,040
So, thank you very much. Toda raba.

611
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,200
Thank you, Michael.

612
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,600
Thanks.

613
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:09,960
Take care
