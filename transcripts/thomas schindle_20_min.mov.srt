1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,200
So, you have to know where you are,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,280
you have to know where you're going,

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,200
and then you have to fill

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,000
your own coding with that stuff

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,640
and start building the infrastructure

6
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,300
for the future.

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,240
Thomas Schindler,

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,320
thank you so much for joining me

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,200
on 20 Minute Leaders.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,600
How are you?

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,640
I'm great.

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,480
It's my pleasure.

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,280
Thank you for inviting me.

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:48,720
Of course.

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,720
Where are you calling from?

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,160
I'm currently in Berlin.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,920
The weather,

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,240
there weather's getting chilly here.

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,640
And we're looking forward

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,240
to hopping back to Costa Rica

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,080
because we tend to hop

22
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,600
between Berlin and Costa Rica.

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,520
Is that for a weather reasons?

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,320
Because of opposite seasons?

25
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,360
My wife is from Costa Rica.

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,200
Beautiful.

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,440
Yeah.

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,520
Very, very nice.

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,920
Thomas, we only have 20 minutes.

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,800
Your journey is so fascinating.

31
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,680
And that, you know,

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,440
if you just look

33
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,600
at the things you're doing,

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,800
it almost looks like

35
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,640
it's exactly the journey

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,720
that are fitting for this show.

37
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,720
These nonlinear journeys

38
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,760
that are not just about

39
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,840
a specific profession

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,040
or a specific company,

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,120
but they are more holistically about

42
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,360
what is our purpose

43
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,040
and who are we as human beings.

44
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,680
And I'm not going to do

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,080
enough service to your journey

46
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,200
if I tried to give an outline myself.

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,040
But I'd love to hear from you

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,160
a little bit about

49
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,800
what are you excited about?

50
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,560
And maybe even take me back a few years

51
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,240
about the different things you've done.

52
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,960
And then I'd love to culminate also

53
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,560
in the most recent company, Delodi.

54
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,480
And the funny thing

55
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,760
that we talked about,

56
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,720
the Delodi or Delodi.

57
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,400
All right.

58
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,400
So, what I'm

59
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,720
always excited about

60
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,080
and what drives me

61
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,920
is trying to contribute

62
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,800
towards making the planet a good place.

63
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,120
And I say goods

64
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,520
intentionally.

65
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,640
And I borrow it from Isabel Allende,

66
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,600
who once pointed to the fact that:

67
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,840
an increment is, while necessary,

68
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,760
never an end.

69
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,760
We have to never forget that

70
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,120
we need to head towards a good state

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,960
and not towards a

72
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,720
suggest a better state.

73
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,680
And the way I like to bring this home is,

74
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,680
if you imagine

75
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,400
14,000 children

76
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,080
under the age of five dying every day

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,440
from preventable causes,

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,600
that would be better.

79
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,480
Because at the moment

80
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,480
it's 15,000, righ?

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,960
But it should be zero.

82
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,360
And that's good, right?

83
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,480
So, should never forget

84
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,200
where we're headed.

85
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,480
And I think that's crucial.

86
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,240
And having this big "why"

87
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,520
is absolutely critical.

88
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,880
And just yesterday,

89
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,480
my son, who's 11 years old surprised me

90
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,280
by finding

91
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,720
Simon Sinek's Golden Circle

92
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,320
all by himself

93
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,960
in preparation for a video

94
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,200
he intends to do

95
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,400
about some future issues.

96
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,320
Wow.

97
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,920
So, how does this "why"

98
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,520
integrate into the life cycle

99
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,160
of an entrepreneur, a leader?

100
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,000
I'd love to,

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,960
because this is something

102
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,320
that I'm personally passionate about

103
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,800
and in my own journey of understanding,

104
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,760
what are the types of things

105
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,320
that I want to be working on.

106
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:54,880
Things that,

107
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,600
and just yesterday

108
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,640
I was walking with somebody

109
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,760
in Tel Aviv, and we were talking about

110
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,520
what kind of company

111
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,240
do we want to build one day.

112
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,520
And we at least decide

113
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,360
that there's two things:

114
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,520
one, we have to be intentional

115
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,720
about what we want to achieve;

116
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,520
the second, it has to have

117
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,760
a positive social impact on the world.

118
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,120
But I'm still confused

119
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,120
what does that mean?

120
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,120
Yes,

121
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,880
I'm continuously confused

122
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,920
and I nurture my confusion

123
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,440
as well as my naive look on the world.

124
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:23,800
And I think,

125
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,400
these are two crucial elements

126
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,200
of trying to move

127
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,680
towards something meaningful.

128
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,040
And not becoming desperate

129
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,320
at the state of the world's,

130
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,400
not becoming frustrated

131
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,360
at the hardships that you go through

132
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,520
when you build something.

133
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,560
And I think this is deeply connected

134
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,000
with the question of,

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,880
what is the ultimate objective

136
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,600
you're after.

137
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,600
And if this is a lot bigger than you,

138
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,640
if this is a lot further out

139
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,160
than you could possibly achieve,

140
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,920
then you're probably on the right track.

141
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,680
Because what I learned

142
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,760
in building businesses,

143
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,440
all sorts of organizations

144
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,080
of the past more than 20 years,

145
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,560
is that,

146
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,880
if I don't align my current activities

147
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,280
with a larger goal,

148
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,880
larger than life allowed me to go,

149
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,360
I'm not never really sure

150
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,560
whether I'm doing the right thing.

151
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,080
And I can never really judge

152
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,400
whether

153
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,800
there is something

154
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,960
that has more impact

155
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,240
towards the goal I want to achieve.

156
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,000
And I have a very specific goal,

157
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
and it doesn't have to be

158
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,280
that everybody has to have

159
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,240
that same goal

160
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,600
of trying to contribute towards

161
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,800
making the planet a good place,

162
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,560
but you can also choose to have a goal

163
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,120
to maximize your personal

164
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,440
financial profit if you wish,

165
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,480
but you need to have

166
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,160
a really clear goal

167
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,040
that goes beyond you.

168
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,920
You have to be intentional about it.

169
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,520
Yeah.

170
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,320
Right.

171
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,360
So, walk me through a little bit about

172
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,240
the different experiences

173
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,040
you've accumulated

174
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,600
and how that goal of yours

175
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,840
played into those different experiences.

176
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,400
Well,

177
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,600
I have to jump back a little bit in time

178
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,720
to dinner table conversations

179
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,400
with my family,

180
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,680
which were usually revolved

181
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,000
around mainly two aspects:

182
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,400
One, was existential risk

183
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,200
like nuclear winter

184
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,320
and climate chaos.

185
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,880
And on the other hand,

186
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,840
things like ion channels in cells

187
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,000
or power microscopy.

188
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,800
How old are you

189
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,640
when you're referring back

190
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,840
to these dinner conversations,

191
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,040
by the way?

192
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,360
I would say, so consciously,

193
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,280
anything between seven and 14, maybe.

194
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,800
Amazing.

195
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,240
So,

196
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,560
and that configured me.

197
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,920
This is kind of like the task

198
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,920
my parents gave us for life.

199
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,960
And it took me a long time

200
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,160
to try and figure out.

201
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,440
A lot of frustration

202
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,240
I had to go through to figure out

203
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,960
how my role could be in that.

204
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:15,800
And what I could see was always that

205
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,120
money seemed to go

206
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,920
in the wrong direction.

207
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:18,840
Money never seemed to go

208
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,720
where it should be,

209
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,320
but more where it was exploiting

210
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,440
more planet and people.

211
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,960
And in 2003,

212
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,840
I was part of a meeting

213
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,480
with the head of the central bank

214
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,160
in Germany

215
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,400
and the former head of central bank

216
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,560
from Belgium,

217
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,200
and they were there to introduce

218
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,160
a new complementary currency in Germany.

219
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,320
And I was there to help them

220
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,200
build the software for that.

221
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,040
For political reasons

222
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,600
this never happened,

223
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,720
but it blew my mind anyway.

224
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,120
And what I learned from those people

225
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,480
was that,

226
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,680
the design of a currency

227
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,280
has unintended emergent properties

228
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,840
that then might be negative.

229
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,720
And our current financial system

230
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,320
has enormous

231
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,360
unintended emergent negative properties.

232
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,760
A fiat currency backed by GDP,

233
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,640
we're not going to go into the details,

234
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,000
but is a recipe for disaster.

235
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,040
It is not only an invitation,

236
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,880
but a reward system

237
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,520
for exploitation of planet and people.

238
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,760
So, that's what I've been struggling with

239
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,880
for the past 17 years.

240
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,640
And what have been

241
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,000
more and more aligning

242
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,880
my activities along

243
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,480
to contribute towards a situation

244
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,680
where we can get out of that

245
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,520
gridlock of financial capital

246
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,200
and broaden our perspective

247
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,360
into other forms of capital.

248
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,160
If I look at only financial capital,

249
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,280
I tend to be very, very limited

250
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,520
in my view of the world.

251
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,720
If I look at, let's say,

252
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,600
Ethan Roland's 8 Forms of Capital

253
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,120
like social capital, and material,

254
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,160
and living, and cultural,

255
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,400
and spiritual, intellectual, etc.,

256
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,640
then the equation changes.

257
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,080
And then

258
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,680
you can allow yourself

259
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,160
to act in entirely different ways

260
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,240
because you're not only

261
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,480
after financial capital,

262
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
which is important

263
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,360
into get things running

264
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,200
and to create more meaningful things,

265
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,640
but is not enough in itself.

266
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,760
But I have to say, Thomas,

267
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,560
speaking to you,

268
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,640
I feel like I'm speaking to a

269
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,880
somebody who goes to India

270
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,600
for 11 months of the year

271
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,280
doing meditation,

272
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,760
doing very spiritual things

273
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,040
in their day to day life

274
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,720
and also as a job.

275
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,520
But actually,

276
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,040
you're the CEO of a company

277
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,520
that delivers software solutions.

278
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,880
And you're into high tech, right?

279
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,240
And I'm finding this, you know,

280
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,840
intuitively, I'm finding this dissonance

281
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,640
between your profession

282
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,280
and what your upbringing

283
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,920
and the things you're passionate about.

284
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,960
And I'm seeing this dissonance

285
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,920
because I just don't see

286
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,040
enough people like this.

287
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,920
I think it's incredible.

288
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,000
But I don't see enough.

289
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,120
So, thank you for that observation.

290
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,920
You're to the point, absolutely.

291
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,160
But I actually think that

292
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,200
there is no dissonance at all.

293
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,000
It's actually extremely congruent.

294
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,400
If you look at,

295
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
especially digital technologies

296
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,680
and also it gets worse

297
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,480
with sustainable

298
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,800
or regenerative technologies,

299
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,640
what you have to do

300
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,160
in order to implement them successfully,

301
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,880
you have to question your status quo.

302
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,360
You have to question your past.

303
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,760
So, if you go into organization

304
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,440
that wants to digitize,

305
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,600
move towards digital transformation

306
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,800
in any meaningful way,

307
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,000
which is part of what we do,

308
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,160
you always have to ask

309
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,520
really fundamental questions.

310
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,760
And this is painful.

311
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,640
Because what it reveals is that

312
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,600
for the past 10, 20, 30, 100 years,

313
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,520
your organization has been

314
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,400
on the wrong track, essentially.

315
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,880
You've been doing things

316
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,040
that look embarrassing

317
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,840
to everyone.

318
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,960
And the only way to deal with this

319
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,360
is to be very clear about yourself.

320
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,320
To have a strong

321
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,720
individual personal foundation.

322
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,680
That's why all of these journeys

323
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,720
have to start with the individual.

324
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,760
And this is why you're totally right.

325
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,920
I don't go to India

326
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,480
to try and be clear about myself.

327
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,240
We've actually developed a framework

328
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,200
to help people do that.

329
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,280
Because that is

330
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,040
of absolute vital basis.

331
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,360
And you can do that

332
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,640
in your everyday life and all the time,

333
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,040
and you can also move that

334
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,840
into your entire organization,

335
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,480
which helps in the decision making.

336
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,960
So, that's what I want to focus on.

337
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,000
Because I think that

338
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,120
I'm on a goal.

339
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,760
I have a personal goal to be intentional.

340
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,240
And I think it's an interesting goal

341
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,240
because my goal is to have a goal.

342
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,880
Right?

343
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,640
I feel that I'm growing up,

344
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,360
I get to have

345
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,840
these really interesting experiences.

346
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,160
I need these really great people,

347
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,240
but I'm trying to become intentional

348
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,040
with my actions.

349
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,480
And what I'm hearing from you is that

350
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,400
we need to have more people

351
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,640
in leadership positions

352
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,360
that are intentional about their goals.

353
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,320
And what do you started out

354
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,240
is by saying,

355
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,600
there are all sorts of goals

356
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,360
and a lot of them are okay,

357
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,120
but you need to be intentional about it.

358
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,840
I mean, when was the last time

359
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,960
you weren't intentional

360
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,320
about your dinner? Right?

361
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,240
So, let's assume

362
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,240
you cook a romantic dinner,

363
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,960
and you never follow a recipe

364
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,200
without knowing what you're cooking.

365
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,160
Right?

366
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,400
Right.

367
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,080
So, usually people don't go on a holiday

368
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,640
unless they know

369
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,960
where they're going and why

370
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,280
and what they're going to experience.

371
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,560
Right?

372
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,880
So, why are people

373
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,440
going through the year, their life,

374
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,560
their next project,

375
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,640
their company,

376
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,480
without really knowing

377
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,200
where they're going?

378
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,360
So, I think there's three,

379
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,840
three important components.

380
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,840
You need to be very clear

381
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,160
where you are

382
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,080
in the vastness of all possibilities.

383
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,960
Incredible, right?

384
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,240
That requires deep,

385
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,040
deep search inside yourself,

386
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,840
to paraphrase the Google thing.

387
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,640
And how do you get there?

388
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,000
Today, with abundance of

389
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,320
both good information,

390
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,800
misinformation,

391
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,720
the things we're experiencing.

392
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,680
In my generation

393
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,480
and our day-to-day lives,

394
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,000
whether it's at university, the military,

395
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,520
in the streets in the city,

396
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,240
we're being pulled

397
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,200
in all sorts of directions.

398
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,280
How can we even begin

399
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,200
to be intentional

400
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,600
about what we're actually feeling?

401
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,160
So, there's this thing called

402
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,240
the Default Mode Network,

403
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,760
which is guiding 90 to 95%

404
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,720
of your decision making every day.

405
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,360
And the default mode network

406
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,680
usually gets coded

407
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,840
in your first seven years of your life.

408
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,040
Wow.

409
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,320
If those people, which we assume

410
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,400
were well intended,

411
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,600
they still coded to you

412
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,720
for an entirely different world.

413
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,200
The rest of your capacity,

414
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,960
your executive network knows what to do,

415
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,240
but your default mode network

416
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,200
pushes you back into behaving

417
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,680
like you always behaved,

418
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,960
and like people were

419
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,080
behaving 50 years ago.

420
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,320
So, you need to clear out

421
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,240
that clutter first.

422
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,040
There are some techniques

423
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,120
of how to do that.

424
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,720
The framework we've developed

425
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,920
is called Roots,

426
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,200
rootsfactor.com,

427
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,480
it's free.

428
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,480
So, anybody can just go there

429
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,640
and sign up.

430
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,040
Amazing.

431
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,000
That helps you with uncluttering,

432
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,760
and then very important,

433
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,800
in developing

434
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,080
your personal first horizon,

435
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,240
which is necessary.

436
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,720
Because once you start uncluttering,

437
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,400
you loose

438
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,720
on the, let's say the hold on,

439
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,760
the current situation of

440
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,520
how things are done in society,

441
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,640
because you're taking things out, right?

442
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,720
You're taking programming out.

443
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,040
So, you need new programming in

444
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,160
and you want to be in charge of that.

445
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,360
If you aren't in charge of that,

446
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,480
you slip into something

447
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,360
called a spiritual emergency.

448
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,320
And a spiritual emergency essentially is,

449
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,920
your brain grabbing onto anything

450
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,040
it can get hold off to make sense of.

451
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,400
This is why

452
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,480
there is so much conspiracy theory

453
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,520
going on at the moment.

454
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,520
Because people

455
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,040
have the strong understanding and notion

456
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,560
and visceral feeling

457
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,120
that the world is falling apart.

458
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,200
And they don't know

459
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,960
how to play a role in that.

460
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,600
And their entire ontology

461
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,960
is breaking down.

462
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,320
They have no epistemology

463
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,520
to make sense of this

464
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,800
and create a new ontology

465
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,920
for themselves.

466
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,960
So, they fill it with conspiracy theory.

467
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,120
So this is very crucial.

468
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,240
So, you have to know where you are,

469
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,360
you have to know where you going,

470
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,280
and then you have to fill

471
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,040
your own coding with that stuff

472
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,720
and start building the infrastructure

473
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,200
for the future.

474
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:06,880
Right.

475
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,600
It reminds me a little bit of a phenomena

476
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,000
that we see all around us,

477
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,680
but especially, I see in my own country,

478
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,280
that you have in a radical religion

479
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,520
that a lot of the time

480
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,560
from an outsider's observing,

481
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,880
it almost seems like

482
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,920
a lot of the actions

483
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,720
that we choose to take

484
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,440
are sort of to fill a fear

485
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,600
of the unknown.

486
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,320
And we look for solutions.

487
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,760
And even if those solutions

488
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,040
aren't necessarily the right ones,

489
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,600
are not ideal for the world.

490
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,440
If they fill that void,

491
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,200
then we take them in

492
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,960
and we adopt them.

493
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,600
And to me, that feels very dangerous.

494
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,080
And it feels dangerous in an age

495
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,040
where we can have misinformation

496
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,200
spread out very easily.

497
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,240
And when there is

498
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,400
some ambiguity around us

499
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,120
and you have somebody

500
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,200
in a leadership position,

501
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,960
we're seeing it unfold

502
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,360
every single day right now

503
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,960
as we're speaking

504
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,240
with what's happening to the US.

505
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,040
And then we're seeing new ideas

506
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,720
and new information

507
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,920
that is necessarily true,

508
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,480
being adopted by people

509
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,360
that are just looking for answers.

510
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,160
And that is something

511
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
that I'm taking with me

512
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,520
as I'm looking to become

513
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,160
potentially is a person who might,

514
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,640
people might want to listen to.

515
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,160
I want to be very conscious

516
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,320
and very responsible

517
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,160
with the messages that I put out

518
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,640
and what's true and what's not true.

519
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,120
That's good.

520
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,800
Maybe you might be familiar

521
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,000
with Robert Keegan's work.

522
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,800
He's a developmental psychologist

523
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,200
and I like using his work,

524
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,080
although it's very similar

525
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,880
to other developmental psychologist work.

526
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,680
He differentiates

527
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,040
between three mindset levels.

528
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,480
He calls it a growth hierarchy

529
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,920
in the adult life.

530
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,400
And it is important to note that

531
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,080
a) every human given enough time

532
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,840
goes through this evolution,

533
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,720
through this hierarchy,

534
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,800
and it's not a power hierarchy.

535
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,520
It's something you grow into,

536
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,960
and it's not something

537
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,400
you can buy yourself into.

538
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,360
So, the first level is

539
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,280
the socialized mindset.

540
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,040
The socialist mindset is defined by

541
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,000
you understanding

542
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,840
the rules of your society

543
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,480
and living by them,

544
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,080
becoming a trusted member,

545
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,360
a working member of your society.

546
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,440
When you step out of that,

547
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,600
and you start questioning

548
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,800
and editing those rules,

549
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,640
you become a self authoring mind.

550
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,520
And this is a discrete step.

551
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,200
This is like the moment in your life

552
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,600
when you started

553
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,680
turning lines into letters, right?

554
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,360
All of a sudden,

555
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,600
you could see these letters

556
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,560
and you could get an idea

557
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,480
of what people were talking about

558
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,120
when they talked about reading.

559
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,680
And then you step out

560
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,520
of your self authoring mind

561
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,400
into what's called,

562
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,680
the self transforming mind.

563
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,200
And now you're looking

564
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,680
at the heuristics yourself.

565
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,800
Authoring mind uses

566
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,840
to edit the socialized mind.

567
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,480
And this is when you start reading,

568
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:07,920
when you start

569
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,240
putting those letters into words.

570
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,600
And you cannot unlearn that.

571
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,160
And it's a distinct moment,

572
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,440
and it has something to do

573
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,600
with the complexity of your mind.

574
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,960
Wow.

575
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,440
I'm just learning how much I don't know.

576
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,880
And I've always been fascinated

577
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,040
by [--].

578
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,920
Yet again, I have to say that

579
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,840
it inspires me to meet somebody

580
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,640
who is in a high tech.

581
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,400
But within this 20 minute conversation,

582
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,320
we never once talked about

583
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,400
the different projects

584
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,000
that you actually worked on

585
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,960
and the impact

586
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,240
that you've brought with them.

587
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,520
But we talked about more holistically

588
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,600
what is our responsibility.

589
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,400
And one of the things

590
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,960
that I enjoyed most was

591
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,760
that the very first thing

592
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,160
out of the box that you said was,

593
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,080
you know,

594
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,680
you mentioned your goal

595
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,400
and what some of your intentions

596
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,680
into having a positive impact

597
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,080
on the world.

598
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,600
But you mentioned that every person

599
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,480
has a different goal or intention.

600
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,560
And one of the most important things

601
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,640
that we can do for ourselves

602
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,480
is to have that intention,

603
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,360
it's to declutter

604
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,440
and go through that process.

605
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,360
And what you said,

606
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,600
its rootsfactor.com?

607
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,080
Yes.

608
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,040
So, I'm definitely going to check

609
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,400
because that's something that

610
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,880
as I'm growing a little bit older

611
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,040
and maturing myself,

612
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,080
and I see that with my friends as well,

613
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,240
we're looking for that decluttering.

614
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,080
We're saying,

615
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,080
we were fortunate

616
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,480
to have these experiences

617
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,440
and to be learning

618
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,360
with these amazing people.

619
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,840
But now we're going to have to make

620
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,120
some critical choices ourselves.

621
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,400
And with all that clutter,

622
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,520
it becomes very, very difficult.

623
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,720
And so, I'm definitely

624
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,720
very thankful for that.

625
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,840
But, Thomas, I want to thank you

626
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,240
for this wonderful conversation.

627
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,320
Before we leave,

628
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,000
I have to ask you for three words

629
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,040
that you would use to describe yourself.

630
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,440
Or that somebody

631
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,360
would use to describe you.

632
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,040
Is this have to be a sentence

633
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,120
or can it be in the?

634
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,600
You choose whatever format you want,

635
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,160
but do to have this on record

636
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,080
that in our next 20 minute session,

637
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,320
you're going to be teaching myself

638
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,800
and the audience

639
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,440
how to do a Thai massage,

640
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,600
which we didn't get

641
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,480
to talk about that either.

642
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,720
Yes, I can do that. Yes.

643
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,680
My wife would be happy

644
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,400
because I'll do it on her too.

645
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,800
Okay. So,

646
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,120
I'm...

647
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:39,120
optimistic beyond reason.

648
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,800
I love that.

649
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,440
Optimistic beyond reason.

650
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,040
I'll try to adopt that

651
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,280
and I'll let you know when I get there.

652
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,560
Thomas, thank you very, very much.

653
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,280
I really appreciate

654
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,840
you taking the time to do this.

655
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,720
And stay safe and stay healthy.

656
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,160
You too.
