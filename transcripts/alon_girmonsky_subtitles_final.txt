Alon Girmonsky, thank you so much for joining me on the show. How are you? I'm good, Michael. Thanks. I'm very good. Okay. In two words, what is it like running a startup in corona times? Give me the ... Crazy. But startup life is crazy so it's not that different. Wonderful. Okay. Alon, like I mentioned right before we started, if I were to list all the companies that you've been involved with in acquisition, whether it was companies that you founded, was the CTO, VP engineering, or anything of that sort, we wouldn't have been able to fit it in 20 minutes. But I am going to ask you, can you just give me a really brief rundown where you came from all the way from when you were in Atudai in the Israeli Defense Forces all the way up until now when you are running UP9. Give me the brief rundown. I'm not sure I can do that because when I was actually at Atudai that was too long, my memory doesn't serve me that long ago. But no. I'm the normal kind of Israeli startup nation story. What does that mean? It's a playbook, right? That we all go to the military, right, meaning the good guys go to ... and guys like us, we go and build things more programs and stuff. So, I started there. At Atudai six years, nine with school and everything. Did my own startup. My first startup was good. It was okay. Compel. What is okay mean? Just for context because 99% of startups just fail. So, when you're saying okay, That's okay. It's okay to fail. Don't let anyone tell you different. No. So yeah. And with startup life, it's very easy to talk about your successes but again, you won't be there. You are not an entrepreneur. You are not in the real startup life if 90% of your experiments fail. Right. I don't know of anyone that kind of okay. You're just in them. They can join someone and then they will be successful but that someone for sure made many mistakes and failures. - Makes a lot of sense Yeah. But on TechCrunch, you read about the successes and that's obviously the cognitive bias that we now have. But Alon, nevertheless, you went through the you're saying the traditional Israeli route. Going to the military and doing some meaningful things there not so much Tel Aviv, but other very meaningful things. And then moving on, creating a startup that's okay. And then you're involved in a series of acquisitions. And what I want to get out of these next 17 minutes or so, is I want to pick your brain about a field or the subject that we talked about, whether it's the transitions between employer or employee versus like a founder or an entrepreneur. What it means to build teams, build products. So, let's start with that first one. What does it mean, that dissonance between being an employee versus being an entrepreneur? Yeah, I think you coined it right. There is a dissonance because for whatever reason, people look at startups and founders and entrepreneurs and think, "Hey, that's fun. We should do that." And then I turn to them and say, "You need to have a bug. You need to be somewhat crazy, to actually want. For years, you're probably top of your class. Very smart. Can do a lot of things, but let's settle for half the take. Work three times as much for half the pay. Fail nine times out of ten. So, you really want to do that" So there is a dissonance between how it looks like and how it is. I can tell you that entrepreneurs, at least from where I look at it, they don't have a choice. Okay? They cannot take orders. They cannot follow instructions. They can try and they'll probably be good at it for a while, but something inside will die. So I think that's the main difference. If you can get a job at Google, do it. I highly recommend doing it. Why do you recommend that? Because I think this is, again, I can't. I simply can't. And if I could, maybe I would. I tried meaning, BlazeMeter my recent company, was acquired by CA and then Broadcom. Very good position. Good company. Different company. It's not Facebook, right? But, I can't. I cannot. When I had to choose - what I'm about to do next. When did you discover this about yourself that you simply can't? Long time ago. When you try and try and try and you rather fail in an attempt of building something because this is where you get the value. You get the value when you build something, right? Right. I rather fail there or be successful for doing someone else's bidding. Interesting. Yeah. So for me, there was no option other than So now I want to extrapolate this, and as you're building your teams across the different companies, I'm wondering You're bringing on to your startups oftentimes the early employees, a lot of them do have that bug in their eye. They're also entrepreneurial. They want to be a part of the success story, but you need to find somebody who can take orders and can fulfill your tasks and your requests even though they're having this entrepreneurial spirit. So, how do you go about doing that? You tell me because I wasn't successful in doing that. No, I'm dead serious. I have a team of 15 people. They do not listen to me, right? And no matter what I do. I need to convince them that what I see is right and maybe they will follow, okay? But, especially Israelis, meaning they do not follow orders. They talk back. Right. And for example in America, this is something that doesn't happen too often, right? So especially with my team that currently is mostly Israeli, they don't do what I say. It's very simple. Yeah. Well but I'm sure that, again, as the CEO, I mean, at some point you do make a decision, right And at some point you say, "Guys, listen. This is our strategy." I mean, you have a few responsibilities. Hire the best people, make sure you have enough runway to continue the company, and have a vision for where the company is headed. And at some point, there is a difference between your understanding of the market and where you're headed versus employee number 15. There must be, isn't there? Maybe in employee number 500. But, no. And you actually said it the three items. One is, point to the vision, right? This is what I do. And you do it once. If you're lucky, you do it once. You can maybe do it twice or three times. The fourth time you're out. But you point to the vision and from that point onward, you explain, you pitch the vision, and the more communicative you are, people will follow. People are looking for someone to follow at the end of the day, right? You fundraise. That's the responsibility of the founder. If you cannot fundraise, don't bring someone else to do it for you. Find a job, right? Right. You fundraise to create longevity for the company. And then you hire the best people you can. And I added you can 'cause sometimes this is what you can do. But if you hire these people and you explain to them and they actually agree with you, if they don't agree with you, they will not follow you. Right. If they agree with you, the dialogue doesn't need to happen on a daily basis, right. The North Star should be there. Yeah. So what I'm hearing from you is, a lot of it is trust. But it's not just, I hear a lot that employees need to trust their CEO. Employees need to trust their CEO. He sets the vision. He or she sets the vision. But what you're also referencing is that the CEO has to trust their employees because in the whole art of talking back and bouncing ideas, and when you're telling me proudly that your team doesn't listen to you, obviously they listen to you, but when you're saying that, what I hear is a proud statement of my team, they are entrepreneurial, they're independent thinkers and they challenged me on my ideas. And that's why we work so well together because we respect and we trust each other. Is that right? That's absolutely correct. But again, everything I'm saying, by the way this is not the truth. This is not object. This is me, okay? So I've learned, I've tried to be like the decision maker would. I have this right hand and that right hand, and this right hand. ... my right hand, right It doesn't scale, okay And I survived that era to a point where it's all about the why. Right. If I am able to convince you why we are doing this, you'll follow me. I don't need even to explain. You will have your own vision and it's good enough. If I constantly need to manage you, we're in a bad place. Totally. So Alon, what number startup is this that you're involved with? Oh my God. Come on. I don't remember. Is it after two hands? So, are you asking how many companies I have founded over the years? Or no you were involved with. No, no, no. That's too many to count. Especially in this day and age where I'm also investing but I'm investing in a company that I can help at least at the beginning. So I don't know, 20, 30, 40. Okay, so Alon, what I really want to know is give me your one or two earned secrets after 20 or 30 companies that you are watching these scrappy, hungry entrepreneurs and these great teams because you're choosing diligently the companies that you're either investing in or you're founding, or working for. What have you learned over these years that a young entrepreneur like myself as I go along my journey, I don't have to go to 20, 30 companies. I can just listen to your advice, and take it as it is. Listen in a very limited manner. Yeah. I've learned something that I was taught meaning I had great mentors, right Even though that when I started, let's talk about the past 10 years because I don't remember what was before. It was too long ago, right But I had great mentors, right And they taught me I said, "I know a lot, but there's far more that I don't know, and I want to learn from people who actually know" So one of the things they told me, "Listen, it's all about you." And I said, "What? What do you mean about me?" "It's all about you" Okay. If you believe it, it will happen. If you don't believe it, no one will help you get there. And I've learned this to be true. I've learned that if a founder believes, it's not about believing in God, it's not religion. If you can envision, okay, the way you're headed and you actually believe you can go there, A, you'll get there. B, people will follow. Okay? So it's all about the founder or the founders, right. Co-founders. So, I try to do it where I live. Again I'm back to, I have some experience behind me, but I'm back to being a founder. It's the same exact experience every other founder has. What becomes easier over time? So now that you're a serial founder and you've had successes behind you and you're coming now with UP9, what's easier than before? What's easier than before? First, I can tell you that it's never easy. Even when you think you know it all, and you've done it all, you learn that because you're not doing the same thing. Right? So, apparently every story has its own unique complexities. Okay? So, that's the one thing. But experience does help you because you know what to expect on the other end. And I think the one thing that causes people to halt is the fear of what will happen. And when you know, hey, we've been through that crises and we've done that and that customer left us and this term sheet blew up, right? And whatever. You know okay, I know what to expect. I know how to manage it. I know how to compare it to other kind of situations I was in the past. Having said that, that helps you some. You still need to deal with the day to day, with new and that's the fun of it. - Right. So it's not a problem. Definitely. And now you're investing. We know each other through J-Ventures. For example. And you're investing and at the same time, you're the CEO of an early stage startup, right? Yeah. Yeah. And to be honest How does that work? It sounds so weird that you're both investing in early stage startups, but you have an early stage startup of your own. Yeah. The one thing you learn very quickly is when you compare your time versus money, invest the money. It's easier. You put it there, hopefully you chose well. Right? And usually, I don't just invest. Right? It needs to be the founding team. It needs to be the industry that I understand. So, it's not a guess, right Right. Of course. But it's easier to invest than, for example, to be an adviser. Interesting. Okay. And to be honest with you, I had far more time when I was, in the past three to four years, when I was an executive in a bigger company. Today, there's no time. Zero time. It's negative time. But again, I'm enjoying every second. I do support the companies I have invested in or am actively advising to but I'm not taking, at least not no more advisory roles. Interesting. Where do you get more energy from: The investor in you or the entrepreneur in you? That's an easy question. That's an easy question. I took a decision, a conscious decision. Should I go into investments and help companies, or do the not so logical thing which is jump back in to where I just was. Okay? It sounds like that takes a crazy person to go through all these ... and then jump back in and do it again from the start. Yeah, but I've realized that a long time ago. So you have to have this something in your head and then you cannot avoid it. Unfortunately. Definitely. Okay Alon, give me your two cents about building products. That's also something we mentioned before. You've built quite a few products. Give me the dos and don'ts. When you approach a product that you're examining, what are you looking for and what are some of the big pitfalls that we can watch out for? Yeah. So, assuming you chose the market right right Assuming you chose the problem, set of problem and solution, that is kind of big enough to matter, okay? When there is, let's say you have a vision market fit, the next thing is product market fit. Okay? It doesn't come first, but it definitely comes second. And I think this is critical. And I think you cannot overinvest in this. It's a period of time, and everything is relatively easy. Vision is easy. Fundraising is easy. Scaling is easy. Product market fit, if you do it right, yes, everything else is easy. If you do it wrong, everything else become impossible. And I think that's a little counterintuitive for I think a lot of people, because when you look at all the fancy YouTube videos or all the lectures that you can attend, most of them are how to raise money and how to build a strong team and how to how to how to. But I almost never see a session on how to find product market fit and how to measure your NPS score. How to know objectively whether you've actually reached product market fit. Yeah. And you mentioned NPS and other tools, but I think that, we're all engineers. This is good and also bad because we have so many ideas. One of the rules I had is, you have an idea, I have an idea. Let's forget about these ideas. And you would say killing innovation, but that's not correct, right If a customer tells you that, if the first customer, the second, the third, this is it. This is what we are going to do. Forget about your idea and mine. Now, having said that, customers don't always tell you, they tell you what they want not what they need. So it's your job to hear them, and then reflect back what you think they need which will be the base for a product market fit. Yeah. And I think that there's the funny quote from the, looking back, that if we had listened to what customers wanted back in the early 1900s, we'd just make faster horses. Agreed. Good example. Definitely. Alon, what are you really passionate about? Fine. Yeah. Startups, entrepreneurship, all these journeys. I got it. You're crazy. But what are you really, when you wake up every day, what is the highlight of your moment the highlight of your day? Listen, I have a ton of things I'm passionate about. Okay? And there are periods in life, like electric guitar and stuff like that. Anything related to music. Cars, motorcycles, mountain bike, road bike, anything extreme wise, diving. You know I had master, not master, but three stars in diving. I forget the degree there. When you build a company, there's no other thing. 24 hours a day, for as many years. Right At least that's the way I'm doing it. It's very tough to keep a life-work balance. I have three kids, right, here at home in Palo Alto and everything. And I think that we are able to keep a work-life balance, but you wake up in the morning, Slack, e-mails and stuff like that. So, and I'm not sure, some people I'm sure many people will tell you otherwise, but this is me. And that was before. And this is a period in time. It's a few years that you don't, this is it. This is what you do and your passionate. This is what I want to do. I don't want to do anything else. I love it. I love it. I love it. Alon, before we leave, the most important question. I need three words that you would use to describe yourself or that any of your employees or current or past co-founders would define you as. So, okay. So, I would define myself as a founder and an engineer. And I'm trying to keep professional into the career, not you know I love my family and we're very much an Israeli family and everything. Yeah. But I think an engineer and entrepreneur. I don't have a third. I know you asked for three, but I know how people talked about me, and not only employees, but customers. Crazy CEO. Okay? And just to explain, it's not like everyone wants to be crazy because it's maybe fun and other thing, but always exaggerate. Like you go into a show, you're doing something, you're expected to do this, do that. Okay? To a point where actually a prospect they came in and say, "Hey, your CEO is crazy." And I said, "Good. I feel comfortable." I love it. Alon, toda raba. Thank you very very much. It's such a pleasure. I learned so much. And best of luck with covid and best of luck with UP9. Thank you so much Michael and awesome initiative. I'm so happy that you reached out. Thank you. Take care.
