1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,680
You can try a thousand different things,

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,200
and you might fail 50% of the time.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,545
You still made 500 things happen.

4
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,240
All right, I think we can get started.

5
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,120
Yali Saar,

6
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,440
it is a pleasure to have you

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,400
on 20 Minute Leaders.

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,680
How are you?

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,240
I'm good.

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,480
Thank you for having me.

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,480
We both have our coffee and tea.

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,000
And we had a fascinating

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,840
two hour walk and conversation

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,120
here in Tel Aviv just the other day.

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,680
And I can't even try to replicate

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,280
some of the amazing things

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,640
that we brought up.

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,000
And I learned so much.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,320
And I can't wait to learn so much more

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,960
from this conversation.

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,840
But I'd love to focus

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,240
these 20 minutes on you,

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,440
and who you are,

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,000
and your journey.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,200
Focusing specifically

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,400
on two incredible initiatives,

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,880
Raising the Bar and Tailor Brands.

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,960
But before we get to those,

29
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,640
Yali, take me back in time a little bit.

30
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,400
Who is the Yali Saar

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,160
and how do you end up running

32
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,388
a multimillion dollar startup

33
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:26,960
in Tel Aviv?

34
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,520
Okay. So, I'll take you

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,400
back to the start.

36
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,520
I started from a little bit

37
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,600
of a different background.

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,080
I was an actor here in Tel Aviv.

39
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,000
I did television, I did theater.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,320
I did a lot of children TV.

41
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,840
And then, I found my way into journalism.

42
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,680
Spent some time

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,280
as a political spokesperson,

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,960
which wound me up actually in marketing.

45
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,280
I moved to the States.

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,200
I studied in the States.

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,000
And then, I opened up a nonprofit there.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So, I was studying in,

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,800
I was studying in Columbia,

50
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,160
Morningside Heights.

51
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,760
And I wanted to see--

52
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,680
Yali, one second.

53
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,120
You jumped way too fast.

54
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,760
How do you go

55
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,080
from being a child TV star

56
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,360
to being a journalist,

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,480
and going into politics,

58
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,840
to go and to study in New York

59
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,840
and then creating

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,600
a nonprofit for education?

61
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,920
Like I need the thinking process.

62
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,040
So, I think,

63
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,240
a  lot of the things that happened to me

64
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,400
throughout the years

65
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,200
kind of just happened.

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,120
I strolled into them.

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,600
So, I think that, initially,

68
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,960
like acting was never a thing to me.

69
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,120
And then, one day,

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,720
I was walking up the street

71
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,160
and  someone walked up to me and said,

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,000
"Do you want to come to an audition?"

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,240
And obviously, I didn't think

74
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,520
I might wound up at a basement somewhere.

75
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,920
So I said, "Sure, why not?"

76
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,640
And I went to this audition,

77
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,560
which eventually was an audition

78
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,840
to a theater show,

79
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,040
in one of the national theaters

80
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,560
here in Israel.

81
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,880
So, I started doing that.

82
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,160
I was 13 or 14 back then.

83
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,960
And that just kind of paved my way there.

84
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,720
And from there, I went into children TV

85
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,240
and I did a couple of shows.

86
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,200
The last one we shot over

87
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,320
like 120 episodes.

88
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,960
There were like--

89
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,440
Wait, wait, what?

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,160
Yeah, everything you can imagine.

91
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,440
Like calendars

92
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,040
with your pictures on them,

93
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,560
and all of that shit.

94
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,360
Wait, I just need the quick names.

95
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,320
What is the name of that TV show?

96
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,760
So, the last TV show I did

97
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,400
before I completely stopped,

98
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,480
was called "Alifim".

99
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,440
And it's still running today

100
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,960
thanks to VOD.

101
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,440
And then,

102
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,560
I found myself at this point in time

103
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,880
when I was acting

104
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,160
for quite a long time.

105
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,720
And I realized,

106
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,120
you know, I don't know

107
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,520
if this is what I want to do in life.

108
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,960
And back then I was going,

109
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,800
everyone in Israel have to

110
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,240
go through the army.

111
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,760
And they had this program

112
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,560
for military journalists.

113
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,200
So, I applied for that.

114
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,720
And back at the time,

115
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,560
I wanted to start writing.

116
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,480
And there is a magazine,

117
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,720
it's a worldwide magazine,

118
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,000
but also in Tel Aviv called, Time Out.

119
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,880
So, I started writing there

120
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,280
just before the Army service.

121
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,360
My sister was actually

122
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,800
the editor in chief of Time Out Israel.

123
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,960
Really?

124
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,000
Yeah. Lian Matias.

125
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,280
Many years ago.

126
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,680
Wow. Okay.

127
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,480
So, probably I was there

128
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,080
like 14 years ago.

129
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,840
I was the youngest writer there

130
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,480
back in the time.

131
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,520
So young, by the way,

132
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,960
that they made me use

133
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,320
a fictional name.

134
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,560
Wow, that's so cool.

135
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,760
I did that.

136
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,960
I went into the army.

137
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,320
And I started doing correspondence

138
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,680
in just kind of conflict situations.

139
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,440
So, Judea and Samaria

140
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,520
and all around the area.

141
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,560
Easy stuff, nice stuff.

142
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,000
Really complicated stuff.

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,200
But things that really get you thinking

144
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,440
and get you to understand

145
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,640
kind of the reality

146
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,520
that you're living in.

147
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,640
And from that understanding,

148
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,000
the minute I kind of finished,

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,600
finished with my service,

150
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,760
I got an offer

151
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,520
to join a political campaign

152
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,440
as a spokesperson.

153
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,200
Which I did.

154
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,720
I joined the spokesperson team.

155
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,080
And I did that for,

156
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,200
it was primaries, we lost.

157
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,880
And then, I knew

158
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,280
that I wanted to go to school

159
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,080
in the States.

160
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,840
It was, by the way, back then,

161
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
we were also

162
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,480
kind of shooting music videos

163
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,720
for bands here in Israel.

164
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,360
So, I said, I'm going to study

165
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,360
things that are in that field

166
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,640
like arts, management.

167
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,400
I initially went to Parsons.

168
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,200
I did one semester at Parsons.

169
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,720
Then I realized

170
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,120
that I wanted to try something

171
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,280
that was more challenging for me,

172
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,280
for the place that I was in

173
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,160
back at the time.

174
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,960
I managed to get a scholarship

175
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,920
and transferred to Columbia.

176
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,400
Easy.

177
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,640
Easy peasy.

178
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,000
Casual.

179
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,560
And I did that.

180
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,840
And I don't know if you,

181
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,360
you probably,

182
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,400
did you ever have the chance to go

183
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,200
into the campus there?

184
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,400
It's beautiful.

185
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,000
It's a city. It's beautiful.

186
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,320
It's a city within a city.

187
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,560
And it's located Morningside Heights,

188
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,800
which is basically Harlem.

189
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,160
And what I realized is that,

190
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,440
you have this beautiful city

191
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,600
within a city.

192
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,560
And people can actually walk into

193
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,840
a lot of the classes for free.

194
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,160
But none of the people

195
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,040
in the neighborhood do.

196
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,360
So, I started this thing called,

197
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Raising the Bar.

198
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,320
And the idea was

199
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,880
getting top tier professors, anyone,

200
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,440
from like Joseph Stiglitz

201
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,360
was one of the

202
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,000
professors

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,280
that was there.

204
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,240
And we had a bunch.

205
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,400
We had like over a hundred.

206
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,320
And we did everything,

207
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,600
from like huge events

208
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,160
of a hundred people,

209
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,600
sorry, of like 10,000 people at a night

210
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,440
to like a hundred bars

211
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,160
throughout the city.

212
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,400
People are speaking

213
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,800
to just like one on one with people.

214
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,640
Basically getting people excited

215
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,760
about education

216
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,840
and coming to school.

217
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,480
Because a lot of the advanced degrees

218
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,000
in the states,

219
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,240
you can actually get a scholarship for.

220
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,680
But if you don't come

221
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,960
from the right background,

222
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,160
you actually don't think

223
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,400
that you have a chance to do it.

224
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,360
So, this is exactly

225
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,200
what we wanted people to understand.

226
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,720
Yali, wait. Before you continue,

227
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,640
I have to

228
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,120
go back

229
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,000
to the junction where,

230
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,440
and excuse me,

231
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,040
but the most important part for me

232
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,200
after the show is to understand

233
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,680
what drives people to do what they do.

234
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,960
And I'm trying to understand,

235
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,960
how does a childhood actor

236
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,080
who goes into journalism, politics,

237
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,360
then moves to the US,

238
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,160
then goes to the Army,

239
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,680
moves to the US for college,

240
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,880
why does he start

241
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,680
a nonprofit for education?

242
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,360
You're not American, right?

243
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,040
You don't have

244
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,280
emotional connection to Harlem.

245
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,800
We have enough problems, you know

246
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,720
of our own that we witnesses here.

247
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,240
Yet you're coming to a new location,

248
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,360
and no matter the location you're at,

249
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:46,920
you decide

250
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,440
that you have to do something

251
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,600
to help those around you.

252
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,200
Why?

253
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,520
Because there's thousands

254
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,440
of other students that don't have

255
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,640
that thinking process,

256
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,960
and they're coming from there.

257
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,600
So, I'll give you the short reason

258
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,560
and the long reason.

259
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,880
And it's the same reason, by the way,

260
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,960
that a few years later

261
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,000
we started Tailor Brands,

262
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,160
and we got to where we are today.

263
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,040
The short reason is,

264
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,280
you know, I'm hyperactive.

265
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,160
I'm hyperactive,

266
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,040
and I always need to do stuff.

267
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,840
The longer

268
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,320
and more appropriate answer is,

269
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,960
I remember

270
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,640
I went to a meeting

271
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,200
with a career consultant.

272
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,440
You have in every college,

273
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,800
you have career consultants

274
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,200
and you go there.

275
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,960
And I was actually going to,

276
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,560
to understand what I should major in.

277
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,760
And she asked me,

278
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,040
"Okay, what do you want to do?"

279
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,680
And I looked at her and I was like,

280
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,360
it has nothing to do

281
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,480
with what I want to study.

282
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:47,160
I want to study

283
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,200
because I want to get education,

284
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,600
I want to get knowledge

285
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,440
if I want to do stuff.

286
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,960
And then it kind of hit me.

287
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,560
I can do the stuff

288
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,720
that I want right away.

289
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,160
And then, I started,

290
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,920
I got this notion that

291
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:06,080
there's no reason to wait for anything.

292
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,720
You can always do the things

293
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,360
that you want to do.

294
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,400
So, I found myself trying to figure out

295
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,600
what I want to do on the weekends.

296
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,840
I didn't want to go out party.

297
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,680
I think that when we discussed,

298
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,680
by the way, about your amazing life,

299
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,240
you also kind of

300
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,400
communicated this urge that

301
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,360
you can go to the parties,

302
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,360
you can go and just hang out with people,

303
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,000
which is great sometimes,

304
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,160
but I always have this urge

305
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,280
to do more things.

306
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,000
To try and figure out

307
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,760
what I can do

308
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,760
that would actually be meaningful

309
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,960
with my time.

310
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,200
And I just saw this amazing opportunity

311
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,640
and I said to myself,

312
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,520
wait, I can make this happen.

313
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,720
There is no reason that this

314
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,880
hasn't happened yet.

315
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
And this is how we open up

316
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,840
Raising the Bar.

317
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,320
And luckily for us, it went really well.

318
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,720
And I think that after a year,

319
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,760
we started opening up more branches.

320
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,080
So, right now it has

321
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,040
branches in New York,

322
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,080
San Francisco, Hong Kong,

323
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,920
Australia, New Zealand.

324
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,760
They just opened up

325
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,480
two branches there

326
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,720
because it's covid free.

327
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,160
But, you know,

328
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,080
it's having this urge

329
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,480
to just,

330
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,440
we have this amazing toolset, right?

331
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,040
This toolset is us.

332
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,760
And this is, by the way,

333
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,800
something that you learn as an actor.

334
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,560
As an actor,

335
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,640
all you do is trying to figure out

336
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,560
how you can get more

337
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,920
out of this tool that you've been given.

338
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,880
And as an actor,

339
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,360
you practice mimics,

340
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,000
you practice your body language

341
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,280
and so forth.

342
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,920
But you also have this amazing brain.

343
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,680
Right?

344
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,320
And we all have amazing brains.

345
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,800
And we can conjure

346
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,560
the most brilliant ideas, all of us.

347
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,360
And usually they just die out

348
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,000
on a paper somewhere

349
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,320
or at the back of our heads.

350
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,400
But I realized that

351
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,920
a lot of the times,

352
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,880
the only difference between

353
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,960
having that idea die on the paper

354
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,120
or actually doing something with it,

355
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,960
is not being afraid to fail.

356
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,040
And I think that's the main thing

357
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,800
that kind of pushes me always.

358
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,440
It's the idea that

359
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,080
you can always try to repeat.

360
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,880
And there is a sentence

361
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,480
that my dad used to tell me.

362
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,520
And he said,

363
00:12:29,521 --> 00:12:35,680
"You can try a thousand different things

364
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,240
and you might fail 50% of the time.

365
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,080
You still made 500 things happen."

366
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,320
Or you can debate yourself for years

367
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,240
whether to do this or that,

368
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,320
which one of the ideas

369
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,560
that you should actually go for.

370
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,320
And you end up shooting out two ideas

371
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,600
and you might actually have

372
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,000
a better chances of succeeding 100%,

373
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,440
but still you only get

374
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,240
two things up and running.

375
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,400
So, that's what keeps me going.

376
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,920
It's just like, let's do,

377
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,960
let's do more.

378
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,480
And the worst thing that can happen is,

379
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,080
you're going to fail,

380
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,120
you're going to get up again

381
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,080
and you're going to try again.

382
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,520
That's exactly why

383
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,320
I'm so inspired by this show.

384
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,560
Because when I ask you

385
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,120
why you're the one who did this and why,

386
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,440
whether it was successful,

387
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,720
the answer wasn't because

388
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,800
I had the most insight,

389
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,840
or I was the smartest,

390
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,320
or I was the best looking in the room

391
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,200
and everybody wanted to follow me.

392
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,920
That wasn't it.

393
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,600
Your answer was,

394
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,480
I'm hyperactive

395
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,920
and I need to do stuff.

396
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,160
And I know I'm very privileged

397
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,280
to come from a community

398
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,640
that supports failure,

399
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,080
encourages failure

400
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,680
as a stepping stone for success.

401
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,360
And we all grow up with this,

402
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,000
with those quotes.

403
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,160
Like Michael Jordan,

404
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,880
you miss 100%

405
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,160
of the shots you don't take,

406
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,760
or Thomas Edison failed 10,000 times

407
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,720
before he got that working light bulb.

408
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,360
But at the end of the day,

409
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,720
most people still don't try.

410
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,760
And I think it's a lot because

411
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,560
of the community

412
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,520
that we surround ourselves.

413
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,320
And that if your community

414
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,960
doesn't support failure

415
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,360
and doesn't encourage you

416
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
to try and learn from these failures

417
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,720
as a stepping stone,

418
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,800
then it's very difficult.

419
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,360
And I'm completely inspired by,

420
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,720
by what you were just saying.

421
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,120
So, thank you for sharing that.

422
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,440
And I have to talk about Tailor Brands.

423
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,240
Because what you're doing now

424
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,360
is unbelievable.

425
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,360
I visited the offices a few months ago

426
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,520
when you were showing me

427
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,240
a little bit about

428
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,920
what you were doing there.

429
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,760
And one of the first things that you did

430
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,840
that completely amazed me was you,

431
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,760
we've just got to know each other

432
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,560
and you took me to the whiteboard

433
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,080
and you started,

434
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,320
I don't know if you remember this even,

435
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,760
you started scribbling the business plan

436
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,480
and some thinking process

437
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,520
about the next reality of,

438
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,240
of how algorithms are going to help,

439
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,600
going to help us do branding.

440
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,480
And I thought to myself, like, wow.

441
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,600
Like here is this guy,

442
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,000
the CEO of a company

443
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,560
that you have over

444
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,560
a hundred employees, you said, right,

445
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,200
in Tailor Brands,

446
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,080
and you're taking time out of your day

447
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,400
to talk with me

448
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,960
and feeding off of my reactions.

449
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,000
And share to me please.

450
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,040
So, talk to me a little bit

451
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
about Tailor Brands

452
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,600
and some of your thought process

453
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,080
as the leader of that amazing group.

454
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,720
So, we have a lot of privilege

455
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,800
working at Tailor Brands.

456
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,440
And I think the main privileges

457
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,760
that I talked about my own urge

458
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,680
to do stuff.

459
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,800
And at Tailor Brands,

460
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,000
we have the privilege

461
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,040
of helping other people do stuff.

462
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,000
Today, Tailor supports--

463
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,080
More than 20 million.

464
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,200
Yeah. Supports over 20 million

465
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,400
businesses worldwide.

466
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,000
Wow. 20 million. Businesses.

467
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,920
No, not just people.

468
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
20 million businesses.

469
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,280
This is insane.

470
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,520
Yali, this is crazy.

471
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,200
And we help them set up.

472
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,920
They come to us with an idea.

473
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,200
And initially,

474
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,560
Tailor was just a way

475
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,080
to help them create a logo.

476
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,160
So, the idea was really,

477
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,240
I have two amazing co-founders,

478
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,600
Nadav and Tom,

479
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,040
and initially,

480
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,480
we thought about this idea

481
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,640
of creating an algorithm

482
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,440
that could mimic creative tasks.

483
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,520
So, I was coming from

484
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,880
a world of copywriting;

485
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,840
Tom, my other co-founder,

486
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,000
comes from a world of design;

487
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,600
and Nadav,

488
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,760
comes from a technical background,

489
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,600
and the idea was,

490
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,680
can we try and figure out

491
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,000
how an algorithm

492
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,720
could mimic the same thinking process

493
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,400
that goes in Tom's head,

494
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,960
the same decision tree

495
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,440
that goes into Tom's head

496
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,560
when he's designing a great logo.

497
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,280
So, we initially did that.

498
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,880
And we worked with businesses

499
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,040
to create logos for them automatically.

500
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,160
But what we realized was,

501
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,280
after they create those logos,

502
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,240
the business is still not up and running.

503
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,320
And we started thinking,

504
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,960
okay, how can we create this platform

505
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,040
that is truly kind of like a one-stop

506
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,720
SMB shop.

507
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,280
How can we take them by the hand

508
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,840
and help them make sure

509
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,840
that the idea doesn't stay on paper,

510
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,600
it actually shoots out to the world.

511
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,960
And maybe it fails,

512
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,760
maybe it doesn't fail.

513
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,600
Statistically,

514
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,000
the majority of SMBs will fail.

515
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,600
But it keeps us up and going

516
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,560
each and every day.

517
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,520
And it's amazing.

518
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,080
And obviously, I have to make it parallel

519
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,400
to Raising the Bar.

520
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,320
In one hand,

521
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,600
you're giving opportunities

522
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,480
for education and for growth,

523
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,280
you're breaking down that wall

524
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,240
where you think that

525
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,080
you can't even make it

526
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,480
because you don't have the skills,

527
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,840
you don't have the ability to go there.

528
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,680
And with Tailor Brands,

529
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,440
you're helping people

530
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,360
get their business off the ground

531
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,480
and make those crucial first steps

532
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,000
to even have that ability

533
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,920
to make that jump forward, that leap.

534
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,000
And so actually,

535
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,560
I actually work towards that.

536
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,960
So, what I always love to hear

537
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,120
from leaders,

538
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,720
and entrepreneurs and CEOs is,

539
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,640
what are some of the most

540
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,400
either exciting times

541
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,480
in the whole journey

542
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,440
that I can look forward to

543
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,240
as I start my own startup pretty soon?

544
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,400
And also, what were some

545
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,240
of the most difficult challenges?

546
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,840
A lot of people say that's lonely,

547
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,000
that sort of stuff.

548
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,360
And it's always really interesting for me

549
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,080
and my friends to hear

550
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,160
from somebody who is

551
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,280
a few years ahead of us in the journey.

552
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,000
So, you know, I can only offer insights

553
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
on my own journey.

554
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,160
And one of the things that,

555
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,880
we love A/B testing at Tailor.

556
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,320
It's something that we do,

557
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,520
we probably have like

558
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
hundreds of A/B tests

559
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,720
up and running at every single moment.

560
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,800
And one of the things that you realize

561
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,880
when you A/B test is that

562
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
some of the insights

563
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,800
that you already have

564
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,600
from your prior experience,

565
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,320
they don't mean anything

566
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,600
when you're trying something new.

567
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,520
So, you know, the things

568
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,920
that worked for us,

569
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,160
and in walk

570
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,120
we talked a lot about

571
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,960
having intention, right?

572
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,040
When you're starting anything,

573
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,880
you want to have intention

574
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,400
and you want to be able to do something

575
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,680
that really excites you,

576
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,680
that is

577
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,160
bringing something to the world.

578
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,440
Tailor, because when we started Tailor,

579
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,440
we were 24, I think, 25 at the time,

580
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,840
we really had no experience

581
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,040
in the tech world.

582
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:04,160
So, our mentality was really about

583
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,080
try, fail, repeat, try fail, repeat,

584
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,200
until you manage to get

585
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,720
some sort of success.

586
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,760
I think that a few things

587
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,000
that I learned along the way is,

588
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,440
a) bringing experience to your team

589
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,240
is often the best way

590
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,920
to avoid all of these failures

591
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,480
along the way.

592
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:28,920
So, you might be super smart,

593
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,760
you might know

594
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,720
the you're doing the best,

595
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,560
but it's still it shouldn't stop you

596
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,280
and it don't let it stop you

597
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,520
from bringing people with experience

598
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,240
that can help you

599
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,400
kind of avoid future mistakes.

600
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,040
At the same time,

601
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,080
you need to give everyone on the team,

602
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,640
regardless of the experience,

603
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,240
an equal voice.

604
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,000
And this is often the best way

605
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,160
to kind of innovate and find success.

606
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,080
One of the things that

607
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,280
we have at Tailor is, I know that,

608
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,280
whenever we have kind of

609
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,360
a feature or anything else

610
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,360
that we're debating what to do,

611
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,760
my voice counts

612
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,400
as much as anyone else on the team.

613
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,240
As long as the data of someone else

614
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,680
is actually more based

615
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,800
than the data that I bring to the table,

616
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,520
then their idea is actually going to win.

617
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,200
Because title and experience,

618
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,040
they don't really increase

619
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,560
the chances of you being right, right?

620
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,280
The data should actually

621
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,440
do that thing for you.

622
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,040
That's amazing.

623
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,560
And I think that

624
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,040
you can start everything you do

625
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,720
with intention

626
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,440
and do something

627
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,560
that you feel is meaningful

628
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,080
as you know,

629
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,520
because it will make you

630
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,360
run longer for it.

631
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,560
But you need to do

632
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,520
whatever works best for you.

633
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,440
If you have that amazing intention

634
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,000
upfront,

635
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,720
that's amazing.

636
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,040
If you don't

637
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,640
and you want to start running,

638
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,760
start running

639
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,600
and you're going to learn

640
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,040
a lot of lessons along the way.

641
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,440
Last but not least,

642
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,360
Before you continue,

643
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,240
I have to say that I love your comment

644
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,320
about the data and being intentional

645
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,120
because that mindset of,

646
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,360
this is what I'm bringing to the table

647
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,280
my experience and my data,

648
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,200
if you're on my team,

649
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,880
no matter what your title or experiences,

650
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,680
if you can show me different data

651
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,640
that supports your idea,

652
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,240
then you are just as credible as I am.

653
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,320
Because I think that a lot of times

654
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,240
people use a visionary as an excuse

655
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,480
for just going headstrong

656
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,080
into something that has no sensibility.

657
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,960
Now, obviously,

658
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,400
we have examples of people

659
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,080
that went against data

660
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,040
and they were very successful.

661
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,920
But most of the time, it's the data.

662
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,880
I think what you're saying

663
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,120
is absolutely true.

664
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,400
I think that one of the things

665
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,120
that astonishes me is,

666
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,000
how many biographies

667
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,640
do you know of success, right?

668
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,040
We have thousands of those.

669
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,440
Probably like tens of thousands of those.

670
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,901
How many biographies

671
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:05,000
do you know of failure?

672
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,760
Not a lot, right?

673
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,360
So, what we do a lot of the times

674
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,120
as we project, we say,

675
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,800
okay, Steve Jobs started something

676
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,600
out of a garage.

677
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,600
Exactly, right?

678
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,920
But I think Tailor Brands

679
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,600
started from something of similar nature.

680
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,000
But that's for another story.

681
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,600
But Yali, I'm sorry to cut you off.

682
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,760
Because I promise

683
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,240
it's a 20 minute show.

684
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,440
I wish I called it 30 minute leaders.

685
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,560
But we have to end.

686
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,360
And I have to ask you

687
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,160
my favorite question,

688
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,600
which is three words

689
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,400
that you would use to describe yourself.

690
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,280
Realistically, intolerably optimistic.

691
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,040
You see, you always have to make it

692
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,560
into a really nice phrase.

693
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,440
But can you repeat that

694
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,040
one more time for me?

695
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,640
Realistically, intolerably optimistic.

696
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,080
I might try to adopt that.

697
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,040
Yali, toda raba.

698
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,920
This is wonderful.

699
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,160
I can't wait for our next walk.

700
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160
I'm learning so much

701
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,920
from every interaction that we have.

702
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
So, thank you for the inspiration

703
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,280
and for honestly making the world

704
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,200
a better place.

705
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,840
That's a living example of that.

706
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,880
So, thank you.

707
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,520
Thank you.
