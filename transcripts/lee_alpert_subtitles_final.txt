1 Lee Alpert, thank you for being on my show 20 Minute Leaders. It's so good to have you. Hi Michael, how are you? I'm doing great. So, every guest that I have on I ask ahead of time how do I pronounce their name because I flunk about 50% of the names with my Israeli accent usually. But now, since we know each other for I think about like 12 years, I didn't have to do that. So, I feel like this is smooth sailing. 12 years. Lee ... at Stanford together. You help teach courses within Stanford Computer Science helping other students that are a few quarters or years behind you with your new expertise. Product management intern at Intuit, incredible experiences both in Hong Kong but also in Greece working with IsraAID, and now, most recently, a new program that we'll hear about near the end. Lee, I'd love to talk about your journey, and I'd love to talk about your role as a section leader at Stanford and all the other things that I mentioned. But first of all, who are you Lee Alpert? Yeah. Hi, everybody listening. Thank you for having me, Michael. I'm Lee. I grew up mostly between New York and Israel, so I personally think I got the best of both worlds in that deal. It's food wise, culture wise, and just kind of seeing being able to contrast those two cultures, that's been incredible. Give me two sentences on that, the growing up on the line between New York and Tel Aviv. What was that like? I think it was really interesting especially because of the politics surrounding the Middle East and Israel and getting perspective on that from both within and managing to take a step back and see kind of the global view on that. I think it gave me a very well-rounded perspective. And sometimes it's hard, right, because you feel like you're always maybe disagreeing or you're always defending or you're always in these tough conversations. Well I have to say that, for me, it was always a dissonance that, especially when I was in the IDF, taking part and understanding both sides of the story and then all of a sudden traveling for the summer to New York and opening The New York Times and seeing things that I didn't really see in the Israeli news, right? That's something that's really interesting. Yes, definitely. And I think it goes both ways. Sometimes you're seeing things in the states that you never see or just in the international papers that you never see in Israel. And sometimes, now there are a lot of protests going on in Israel ... voice that hasn't been heard in a while in Israel is becoming very vocal. And to me, that's very exciting. And that maybe isn't in the front headlines internationally. And it makes sense why that isn't so, but it does kind of help place you in a more global sense. 100%. Yeah. I think growing up with that was very important in shaping my perspectives on that. And it's definitely something I'm still always learning how to navigate both with those two cultures and any others I'm experiencing. Well, just as a dramatic shift it is to go between between Israel and New York throughout the years, you went to the Israel Defense Forces, you spent several years there being with primarily Israelis, and then one clear day you wake up and you're at Stanford University in a completely different world. Start with that first experience. Tell me a little bit about the IDF and what was that experience like for you? So, I was a medic which I have absolutely loved. It was really incredible. And I think what I always say of my time in the Army is it was so incredibly different from anything I had done before or will do after. It was just so unique. I'd attended an, we had attended an international school beforehand, so a lot of people we went to school with, and there was variation, a lot went to foreign affairs. I ended up as a medic in a very small base in the Golan Heights by the Syrian ... Why medic? I thought that you would go into a variety of places. I didn't think medic would be one of them not because it's not fantastic, because I just didn't realize that you had an interest in medic. Yeah. I guess it was something I kind of fell into. I definitely wanted to try something new. I wanted kind of that intense experience of being on a smaller base, being on a base where I would spend bigger chunks of time there, and I really got that. I was exposed to all types of people I never would have met from every socioeconomic status ... really important. And then being a medic, and especially in the military, I think if you study medicine, and of course I understand why, but if you study medicine in really any other space, takes a long time before you're poking someone. Whereas in the IDF, because of resources and just time, it's really you're just going and you learn by practicing on each other. And it can get a little gory. Medics get made fun of for starting to like that gore. But I loved it. I realized I really liked the component of helping people. I liked kind of the more intense training. And you never know until you're really in the situation, but it was cool to learn about myself that I could handle that and that I was calm under pressure. I think that was, I even sometimes was made fun of for it a bit. Soldiers would come in panicking, and the first thing I would do I don't ask what's wrong ... "Okay, relax. Everyone take a breath." And I think that applies to anything in life and same as really just learning to work with limited resources and making things happen. I have to say, so a lot of people, especially around Silicon Valley, they talk about the startup nation, and one of the things that Singer and his co-author talk about in the Startup Nation book is this idea of resilience and the quick path to maturity through the IDF. And while a lot of them are talking about the 8200 or the elite intelligence units as key factors for the startup nation, people like also Eric Schmidt, they talk about this exact what you're talking about. This idea that you're being faced, you're being placed in these high stress situations. And at the age of 18, 19, you learn that the most important thing you can do when somebody comes in panicking is to calm them down and calmly assess the situation. And so, for me, that's a perfect example of also something that I felt that I gained through the IDF. But I'd love to also transition now to Stanford and hear about what that experience was like moving from putting the uniform down, getting on a plane, and finding yourself in the beautiful Silicon Valley in one of the most beautiful campuses in the world. Yeah, definitely. It happened really fast. I was sending in my applications while hot spotting from my bunk bed in the Golan Heights. And then, within the span of less than a year, I was going from being a medic to, I probably waitressed or bartended a bit, got a quite a bit of time to travel, and then was a student at Stanford University, which still blows my mind sometimes. And I think I knew it would be a change and I knew it would be hard to go back into school after being out for a while. And in some ways it was even more so than what I expected. There was definitely one night where I re-taught myself what basic trigonometry was the night before. I'm still trying to re-teach myself, so you're fine. Oh, yeah. You know when you hear everyone talking about how they forgot all their math over summer and then they're just nodding, yeah. Yeah, those three, four years ago, right. But it's been an incredible journey. I got so lucky, I think, just really met incredible people. Kind of learning, I think, how to navigate it and make the most of all the opportunities, because we're so fortunate in that there's just so many incredible opportunities at Stanford. And sometimes, it's almost so much you feel bad that you can't make everything, you can't make every amazing speaker, and I think, with time, you really learn how to navigate that and make the most of it and you get really excited and it's so cool. Lee, give me one thing that truly surprised you when you came. You come into Stanford and you're like, "Wow. When I was back in Israel, I did not realize that this is going to be like this." Oh, that's a tough one. I think, honestly, for me a lot of it was just all these interests that I really picked up. And things that ... I guess, actually, you probably knew me back then, but I don't know if you know this, but I think 12 year old Lee, if you told her she would be excited by FinTech or would have gone to computer science or thought business and technology was and get this excited, I don't know if she would have believed you. But I think it's discovering all these different passions and even the areas that you don't go into. I have so much respect for all of my peers that I see doing incredible things in other spaces. Well  I have to say that for myself, one of the things that really surprised me was the amount of passion that I saw. So, I knew it was a great institution, I knew that it was a beautiful campus and that the professors were great, but sitting alongside peers that I looked at them as 18 year old people that, I commanded soldiers that were older than them just a month before I got to Stanford. Literally a month. And for me, walking there and thinking of them as children, and all of a sudden seeing their passion and seeing them as equals and we're having so much fun, and they're much smarter than me and much better than me, I think, to me, that was the greatest shock to me. You choose to go into computer science and you go through that track, you go through the systematic track of the famous classes that we have in our 106 series. And then you become a, sort of a teacher assistant section leader for that. Yeah, definitely. And I'll agree with you completely on the passion component. I think it's inspiring. And it's people of every age, right? It's 18 year olds, it's professors, it's business students. And for me, I didn't go in gung-ho knowing I would do computer science. I think a part of me almost tried to not do that because so many people were doing it, but I took one course and I took another, and somehow it went okay or even well. And I really enjoyed it. And I liked how it teaches you to break down problems and think of the world. And I think anyone who's ever coded knows that there's no better feeling of getting it to work right after struggling with something. And I got really lucky. And I had incredible section leaders and incredible teaching assistants and professors during my courses. And I had been very intimidated. Stanford computer science, I had no experience. It was something I was scared of. And then I finally got around to doing it and I loved it and I thought, Okay, I would like to be like one of the people who helped me first get into this, and I would like to help teach this course. I love it. And it was great. And you actually mentioned that teaching students in the years below, but that's not necessarily true. It's actually one of the most commonly taken courses at Stanford, and we definitely see law students taking it too. And it's just such a cool space, and it's great to see what a variety of students can enjoy this course, whether computer science is their main field of study or not. So Lee, paint me a picture because it is one of the most popular courses at Stanford. It's notorious for being excellent, an excellent course that's been developed over more than a decade. The year actually that you were section leading it, so teaching other students, you actually, it changed an entire language, right, from Java to Python, which I'm sure was an interesting transition, but paint me a picture. A new student arrives at Stanford. They go into the first computer science class. This is an incredible experience, and I'd love for you to maybe paint me a picture of what that's like and what is the role of the section leader within that experience? Yes, definitely. And I think this is something very unique that happens at Stanford. And, of course, it's dependent on resources, but just a great model for teaching is that in addition to these very large lectures with incredible professors, they also really hire and teach and train and make this community of students who will help with the teaching themselves. And then you meet with students in smaller groups, maybe about 10 students once a week to reiterate what they learned in lecture, to actually do ... problem solving. And for context, the lectures themselves can be sometimes 300, 400 students, right, which is what people are looking ... and saying, "This is not personalized. It's 400 students." But the section is where you really get the added value, right? Yes. And for me, I remember those were so helpful. Just getting that practice as opposed to lecture style learning, which personally, and I think for many people, is a lot harder. And then, also, when we grade their work, we actually sit with students one on one. We leave them notes virtually, but we also meet with them in person and really go over what went great, what could have gone a little better, how can they improve, maybe give them ideas for how they can take this one step further, go beyond the scope of the assignment. And then there's also a ton of office hours, and I think it's that level of feedback and interaction that really sets us apart and is a reason why these courses get such great feedback from every type of student. And it's also great to see how they really built this community of instructors and they really value and want our feedback in how the course is going both in the syllabus, content, style of instruction in order to improve it since they understand that we have so much contact with the students. It reminds me a lot of the IDF mentorship where age is not the factor. Sometimes it's just another peer that's teaching new material even though you may be more professional in other fields. Like you have law, like second year law students who are coming and you're teaching them computer science and you're grading their work. What do you tell a student that is just starting out? Because you are section leading for one of the introductory computer science courses which is the beginning of the funnel. And one of the greatest challenges that I know the faculty, and all around the world, are dealing with, both the diversity issue that of the funnel, it's primarily males, unfortunately, that continue. And the reasons are flawed for that because it actually turned out, I believe I read a few research reports, that actually females perform better in those courses than males do. So, it's more of a social issue. But what do you tell somebody who's starting out and they're having some trouble, they're scared, it's difficult, they don't recognize the language. And they meet with Lee Alpert, who's their section leader, and they look at you as the teacher because you're the one grading their work. I think there are a lot of things. One, and we do talk about this and how to approach this problem. I think one the biggest things I do is I try to tell them, This was so hard for me too. No one gets this right away. And also reflect on how far they've come since they started. And I think it's trying to find a way to teach it which works for that student because not everyone is the same learner and there's so many different ways to approach a problem, especially in computer science. And I think it's not giving up and looking for that approach that's right for the student. And I think it's actually really exciting that you brought up this diversity because, I'm not sure if you were part of code in place that was- No, not this past quarter. No. Tell me about it. Yeah. It was this really exciting initiative that came together very fast by some of the biggest computer science professors at Stanford and people who are involved in the section leading program. And they wanted to make this course, or at least the first five weeks of it, accessible globally. You have so many people studying remote. For free? For free. For free, remotely, but have this style of teaching - Amazing incorporated into this program. The same idea of section leading? Same small cohorts? Yes. So, in order to achieve that, because, oh I wish I have the numbers for you, but I know that we had thousands of students, and we also had thousands of volunteer teachers, which was really, really cool. And I got to actually help train some of those volunteer teachers in the way that we do the section leading. And it was great. I had my Norwegian cousin took the course. People from all over the world took this course, and it was really cool to see. And the completion rates for free courses that are in this style tend to be really low because sometimes there isn't that incentive. You're not getting a grade, you haven't paid for it so you don't feel the need. But I think we did really well. And it was such a cool global process to see, especially with this issue of diversity being so important. Wow. Okay. Lee, all that is just fascinating, but I want to make sure that I leave two or three minutes to talk about what you did in Greece. I remember following your journey on social media back then, and it was inspiring, and you were volunteering there for quite some time. What were you doing with IsraAID over Lesvos, Greece? Yes. So, I was a humanitarian fellow with them. IsraAID is a nonprofit that works really, they go for humanitarian disasters all over the world. I was focused on their project in Lesvos, Greece. Unfortunately, Lesvos, Greece, because of its location near Turkey, became really when the refugee crisis was at its peak, approximately 2015, a lot, a lot of refugees from all over the world were trying to access the EU through this small island in Greece on the border of Turkey. And it was just a crisis. It's home to Moria refugee camp, named in a lot of articles as one of the worst refugee camps in the world. And I was there helping with medical and educational programs. And it's really one of the most important things I've done. I got so much exposure. I'm still in touch with so many of the people I work with there, both people who were volunteers and people who were themselves asylum seekers. How long did you spend on the island? A month and a half I think. Wow. And then I continued to stay in touch with people and I try to speak at events about what I've done. And what was really neat there, and a big lesson I learned there, was also just how I got involved with ... in the first place. It definitely remains one of the most important life experiences I've had. And I got involved with it because a friend, they were speaking at Stanford, a friend knew of my interests in the area and just suggested I come. And I think a big lesson I got out of that, and continue to try and implement now and hopefully always, is just make your passions known, help each other out, and then those around you will let you know of opportunities. There'll be so much for you and help each other out in that case and connect friends and make all of those things happen. I think it's also inspiring that one of the things that, as you come to Stanford, you hear very quickly is what is your next internship and what huge company are you going to work at and what big name are you going to put on your CV. And the fact that you're putting that aside and you're saying, I want to first pursue a passion and I want to pursue something that I can actually make a dent and an impact on people's lives. And only through, through following you a little bit through that summer, I know that you've impacted so many lives. So I think that's a really important message that definitely people that I talk to in freshman year at Stanford I try to share as well. But Lee, I can't believe 20 minutes go by way too fast. It's unbelievable. But before we leave, I have to ask you for three words that you would use to describe yourself. Yes, definitely. I think, this is always a hard question. It's the hardest. We were just reflecting that Stanford asks a similar question on their application process and how difficult it was to answer. It was hard then. It's hard now. I think, I would like to hope that thoughtful, that I take time to consider a lot of perspectives on each issue I'm delving into. Passionate, that if you do something, give it 100%. And excited just about all the things there are to do and see. I love it. Lee, thank you very much. Toda raba. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll see you at campus in the very, very near future but hopefully later on. And continue doing good for the world and inspiring others. Thank you very much. Thank you, Michael. Have a good one. Wonderful.
