David, thank you for joining me and giving me your time. Thank you, Michael. Nice to meet you. How are you doing? So you're talking to me from Dallas? From Austin, actually, right Yes. Correct. How are you? And you just moved here -- you moved there before the corona started? Actually, in between. I caught the last flight from Israel to United States. The last one? The last one, Delta flight, yes. Wow! Okay. It's a good thing you got the last one and how is it over there right now? Is it crazy? It depends. Everything is compared. We have some friends in New York and they suffered really hard. - Oh, yeah. - And compared to them, we are in a pretty good situation right now. Definitely. Okay. So the most important thing to note is that I'm speaking here to an optimist, which is great. I love that, and you consider yourself well-versed in what it means to bring happiness to consumers. That's my little dog here, Benny, who might make an appearance. So we'll just let him set aside for a little bit before he gets us into trouble I'd love to sort of walk through a little bit about your history your background, and how you got excited about this topic. And I would love to touch also a little bit about on what it means to have a startup -- You're the CTO of a startup in the travel space -- marketplace in the travel space, and it's pretty challenging times for these sorts of companies now. So maybe you can touch on that a little at the end. - Sure. - So let's just get started. Tell me a little bit about yourself. My name is David. I was born in Russia. We moved to Israel when I was 12. Since 2016, I worked a lot with US companies. I actually started my career at a company called NDS. I built various security solutions for digital TV, more like projects for DIRECTV, BSkyB, and some other big corporate clients. I moved to my own business, my own startups in 2010. Since that period, I had an experience working on different products from financial industry, advertising, et cetera. I was part of NFX Guild accelerator in Palo Alto few years ago, actually. Was co-founder of Free Startups Board, with many different other startups as well as Fortune 500 companies. I joined Stride a year ago, a bit more than a year ago. Right now, we are in a pretty interesting and challenging times. Yeah. But we do believe that we will create a serious impact for people when all this madness, is over and -- Definitely. People will -- will definitely want to go to some great Safari tours or some interesting experience in Himalayas or some amazing tours that they are like dreaming right now all the time. And we will help them to make it real soon. As a company? Yes. Oh, wonderful, wonderful! That's amazing. I actually did -- I did a -- I went to Kilimanjaro a few months ago with my family as well as a Safari and it was one of the most extraordinary experiences that I've ever had. Tell me a little bit about yourself and why you consider yourself an optimist and what makes you take about bringing happiness to consumers? I worked a lot on B to B projects and different projects that didn't make me feel -- they help me to get pretty good money on one side and I also invest it in some other startups as well, but it's not something that creates meaning in your life and it doesn't provide any serious value if you really want to move forward to build something that, actually, you want to wake up for and move yourself over. When I was a kid, I asked my mother what does it mean being happy. And I got the following answer from her, "When you wake up early in the morning, you are happy to go to work and in the evening, you're happy to go home." This was her definition of happiness. I try to define it myself. I'm probably still working on this and my wife always joking at me like, "Are you talking about happiness? You're still struggling to define it for yourself. How can you actually provide happiness to others?" So try to, first of all, find it in yourself and this kind of I actually recommend to all other people― entrepreneurs and just people who want to work in a great environment. - Yeah. - First of all, starting from your own personal life. Define what does it mean happiness for yourself. - Is it -- - Sure. really something that matters to you at all? Can you take it from there? Just an example on myself, like what does it mean being happy for myself It's spending time with people I like and people I love. My family, for example. I do like helping other as well. I highly believe in solidarity and it's a great example right now in those crazy times that people share some food that they bought and some masks and helping each other. It's something that make a huge impact. And on a personal level, integrity is something that's really important as well. Those are my points, my matters. When you go to your job, for example, what matters to you, like -- what kind of people you would like to work with? I can give an example. I personally like working with people who are doers, who are actually -- can deliver something. I do want to be in a supporting environment, people who help each other and don't blame each other like, "This is your fault," and et cetera, et cetera. It's really important that people respect each other as well. It's critical to have really great relationships in the company as well. And the entrepreneur mindset, it's something that also makes me happy. And when we are moving the same pattern to product, what do you like about your product? or like a -- - Right. - great user experience, right? You do want that the product you are using or making share some common values with you. The product must be aligned with your values that you believe in. And if it's something that you don't believe, you will never use it, right? Right. On another part, when you build a product, you want real true fans. And when you make like a significant impact, you will have those fans and they have some feelings about your products. And let's say, you release something they didn't like, they respond. "Listen, we didn't like this, and we didn't like that, but we really want this back," and then so on. They will try to convince you that this type of product needs to be updated or changed, and so on. The worst part for any product is people who don't really care about it at all, like, "This product is indifferent to me," like Today, you are a hero, that's fine. We are fighting on just the price and that's it. And tomorrow, someone else will just improve their supply chain and reduce some pricing cost and -- There is no product at all like -- And your company just goes away. Right. Those kind of things that really matter, I highly recommend for any person who is involved in product building, product definition, first of all, start from your life. Move to your work definition and then, move to product. and by this you can actually define all of the process yourself. No, that makes a lot of sense. I do agree on a lot of points here. I think this idea of resilience and what allows you to to keep going and even when the going gets rough, and you know, having those users aligned with your core values and when your product shares those core values, then the users are not just buying your product, but they're, all of a sudden, becoming champions of it, and they feel personally attached to it. And you actually I did a little bit of research before and I think you have a pretty interesting story of a bicycle accident, right? Did I see correct? Yeah. You broke both your hands and you managed to still do something interesting while breaking both of your hands. Yeah, it's a long story about that. I had some accident and I was in some like crazy situation seven, eight years ago, actually. Yeah. I had to recover myself personally, financially, and just everywhere. And it was a very challenging situation. One person that probably really helped me to move over this situation was my wife, and she actually helped me, and she was extremely supportive beyond this period of time. And you always need this person. Some other people that I got all the inspiration from, more people that were around me. They actually helped me to move forward, and it's pretty important situation. - And the -- - And that you actually -- during that time, you learned Ruby on Rails, right? Not exactly. I actually had previously experience using Ruby on Rails. I think it was version 1.8 at the NDS at that time. And I started checking what's going on in the market right now? Where can I go next? Like what should I do? I had like a very serious bicycle accident. I should move over. I wasn't able really to write a code at that time because I was fully disabled. And I said, "Okay" I know that Ruby on Rails has like a very serious impact on many startups at the time. Right. And Basecamp was developed during this period and some other great startups. And I said like, "I have to move with this software." This software actually helps a lot of developers just to build great stuff, and I can move forward. I started learning just by doing. At the same time, the demand just became very high and I started helping other startups and move forward from this period. Yeah. And so, you became a consultant on Ruby on Rails? I also did some consulting, not only for startups but I worked with a company like Canduit and some other big companies as well. I worked with Gartner New York and Pricewater Cooper House in San Francisco, - and - Sure. So I actually had startup experience as well as Fortune 500 as well. So tell me a little bit about Stride and what are some of the core values that you have over there that you know are aligned with yours that bring happiness to users? First of all, being in the travel industry is a great thing to deal with, right? it's something that -- you always like to travel unless you prefer sitting on your couch and just -- Yeah. watch TV or Netflix, or whatever. But most people do like travelling, especially, in those crazy times. So I am very aligned with the major goal helping people to find exactly where they can go right now, what type of experience they can get in various places around the world, not only just on the next street or just around you but all over. -- Yeah. -- And this is something that we are trying to achieve by helping people to move all around, get to know many different jumps around the world, and move forward. And this is probably the most interesting part in Stride that we are working on right now. And so, what is it like being a CTO of an upcoming startup, and all of a sudden, corona breaks out? Good question. It's charged on -- Listen, there are always ups and downs, and it highly depends if you have enough time with your cash on a personal level, as well as on the company level. Yeah. Sometimes, you have to make immediate decisions like some people you have to lay out or fire, or just pull some projects, specifically concentrate on cash. It's probably the most important one. Measure everything you're doing many times a day starting from planning. Is the thing that you are working right now really matters to you and to your customers? Will this something that will make a change in the upcoming months? How people actually gonna spend their time on travel after the coronavirus pass? Will they actually travel abroad or they try to stay around? So there are a lot of questions that we are trying to answer right now. And I assume that nobody actually knows the true answer. Definitely. Right. But we will see. It's an interesting time. It's an interesting challenge. And we're here to make it work. I'm optimistic by my nature because being pessimistic doesn't provide any value. And you need some personal balance in your life just to move forward. - Right. - It's something that pretty important. How important is it do you think to be an optimist in a leadership team, whether it's a startup or a big company rather than being the pessimist or the realist that is always trying to give the bad side to things? Because there are balancing personalities that I would find useful also in our leadership team. All right. Sometimes, you see being too optimistic is not always good, like you're trying to oversell yourself too much. You're trying to bring too much promises without actually providing any value, and it's not good. At some point, it just creates a negative impact. On the other side, you always should be more optimistic than realist or pessimist, I don't know, and be prepared because -- the future is bright and we want to go to something happy, and dealing with something that doesn't really matter at all. It doesn't provide any motivation. Right. Neither to you nor to your team and it doesn't provide like any serious value. - I think - Right. every entrepreneur must be optimistic in some way; otherwise, nobody really can survive it. When I'm a startup founder, I wake up every morning. I decide, "This is the experiment that I'm going to do today." At the end of the day, this experiment will fail and the next morning, I have to wake up with the same attitude that I am going to make experiment number two. And this experiment may fail as well but this is the startup life and it's crucial for you to survive this kind of trial and error routine. And being optimistic is a must have. How do you then delegate that happiness and optimism to the people that work under you as a CTO, because you're not necessarily the one who's writing all the code, and a lot of the times you have to also put on this product hat and you have to bring a lot of that down, you know, top-down for the team. What are some of the ways that you do that? Great question. So, you really need to split your tough -- your stories into like small chunks, small tasks. And this actually helps to deliver faster and make frequent delivers actually helps the team move forward. Right. This type of development mindset actually helps a lot because, let's say, if you decide on building a product with a huge amount of features and a big list of requirements on it's own, nobody really can deliver it, but if you just split it into small chunks of requirements, and every time you build something, you deliver it, you test it immediately, you get the impact, and so on. - This actually helps - Definitely. people who works with you move forward and see the real impact. And every line of code should have an impact. If the line -- Nobody writes code just to like -- as beautiful code. It really doesn't matter like seriously. - Right. - Sometimes, you just have to realize real people actually enjoy having this situation. It doesn't matter if you work on a client right now or you're building some back office. Just put on your head the same person and try to do the same process. _ It doesn't -- - Definitely. make you happy, just using this smaller project. It's something that I always request from developers. Just try to use it yourself. Will you actually use it, like literally. You don't need a designer, you don't need a user experience guy. And so, just be the user yourself. Definitely, definitely. So we have to -- our 20 minutes is coming up, but I'd love to ask you the final question. And it's putting you a little bit on the spot. But what are three words that you would best describe you as? I already know at least one of them. But what are the three that you would best describe yourself as? Optimist is one of those. I like helping people is the second one, and I'm entrepreneur, I like traveling and move forward. That's really, really great. David, thank you very, very much. - Thank you. - It was great. - Great. Take care. - Bye-bye. Bye-bye. It was wonderful, really. Thank you.
