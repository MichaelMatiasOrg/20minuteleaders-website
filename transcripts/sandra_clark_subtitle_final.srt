1
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,760
Wonderful.

2
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,440
Okay. Sandra Clark, thank you

3
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,760
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

4
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,720
How are you?

5
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,880
I'm excellent. Thank you.

6
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,640
A little warm today, but otherwise great.

7
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,240
Definitely.

8
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,560
Definitely a little warm.

9
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,280
It's definitely some interesting times

10
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,000
that we're living in.

11
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,520
2020 continues to surprise us.

12
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,040
But over these next 20 minutes,

13
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,240
you are gonna help me

14
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,760
become a little bit more knowledgeable

15
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,120
about LinkedIn.

16
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,400
So, a professional platform

17
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,800
that most of the people

18
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,720
that are listening to this use.

19
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,640
It's something that I definitely enjoy

20
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,880
using all the time

21
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,960
not only because it helps me

22
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,600
connect with others,

23
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,920
but because I get exposed

24
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,560
to what other people are working on.

25
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,400
And one of the things

26
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,600
that is becoming more and more apparent

27
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,000
is that our social interaction

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,280
is no longer just,

29
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,600
the work-life balance is shifting,

30
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,240
and all of a sudden,

31
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,440
a lot of my personal connections

32
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,600
are also on LinkedIn.

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,520
And it's all becoming

34
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,880
one big container and mixture.

35
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,000
And I constantly am getting

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,120
both spam messages

37
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,280
and interesting messages

38
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,200
and I'm reaching out to people,

39
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,160
they're reaching out to me.

40
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,520
And the biggest question,

41
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,720
this question of building

42
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,800
the right resumes

43
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,360
have been going on forever.

44
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,600
Our LinkedIn is essentially

45
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,280
our new resume.

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,320
So, I'd love to spend these 20 minutes

47
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,960
talking about what I can do to maximize

48
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,840
on my appearance

49
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,040
and professionalism on LinkedIn.

50
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,080
But before that, Sandra,

51
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,720
I'd love to talk about

52
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,840
you learning how to swim.

53
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,440
Talk to me about that.

54
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,440
Okay. So, if I want to do something,

55
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,640
I just decide somehow I'm gonna do it.

56
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,360
So, somehow I managed to become an adult

57
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,680
without ever learning to swim.

58
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,040
My mother was afraid of water

59
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,840
so would never let me in the water.

60
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,600
And I got this wonderful idea,

61
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,800
I was living in Thailand,

62
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,360
that it'd great to scuba dive,

63
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,720
but you sort of need to swim

64
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,280
before you scuba dive.
- A little bit, yeah.

65
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,200
So it was a little awkward,

66
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,560
but I had a pool at the apartment complex

67
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
and I went in the pool.

68
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,040
And then I'd never put my face

69
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,640
under water voluntarily.

70
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,160
So, I filled the sink up

71
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,320
in the bathroom with water

72
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,280
and practiced putting my head in,

73
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,840
opening my eyes,

74
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,680
and teaching myself to swim.

75
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,640
Became a scuba diver.

76
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,520
Even became an instructor.

77
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,920
So it's kind of been the story of my life;

78
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,840
you want to do something,

79
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,000
figure out a way to do it.

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,520
So, I just want to paint the picture

81
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,440
that you're in the room

82
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,400
and you're filling up the sink with water

83
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,440
and you're putting your head down

84
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,000
so that you can get over the fear

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,920
of opening your eyes

86
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,440
and putting your head underwater.

87
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,700
Yes.

88
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,890
I just love it.

89
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,920
I've done stranger things.

90
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,000
Well if we have time in the end

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,720
I'll need to know one more strange thing.

92
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,780
But then, the fact that

93
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,840
you're not only scuba diving,

94
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,400
but you're becoming

95
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,960
a scuba diving instructor,

96
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,240
I think that's a real inspiration.

97
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,120
So that's just a wonderful story.

98
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
Sandra, how did you get started

99
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,920
with your expertise in LinkedIn?

100
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,640
What drew you to that?

101
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,960
Well, it's almost another

102
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,560
putting your head in the water story.

103
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,760
I was laid off

104
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,400
from the University of California

105
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,120
where I'd been for 25 years

106
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,800
and at that point thought I would stay.

107
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,160
They had other ideas.

108
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,400
They pushed me out the nest.

109
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,280
And who knew

110
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,280
but I discovered I could fly.

111
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,200
I started the whole job search thing

112
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,840
and going to these classes

113
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,960
to learn how to do a better resumé,

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,920
to do interviews, ... Linkedin.

115
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,760
And after the Linkedin training,

116
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,360
people would be coming up to me saying,

117
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,920
"Well could you just sit with me and help me?

118
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,560
You seem to get it,

119
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,880
and I'm really struggling."

120
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,700
So, after about 20 of these people

121
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,960
said, "You're really good at this. You should be charging"

122
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,520
So, in the heart of Silicon Valley,

123
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,560
... all an entrepreneur

124
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,240
I'm a little late to the game.

125
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,600
But I thought, why not?

126
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,720
So I started my own business

127
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,600
helping people set up LinkedIn.

128
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,800
So, helping people set up LinkedIn.

129
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,200
So everybody has almost, almost everybody,

130
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,400
especially in Silicon Valley,

131
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,360
has a LinkedIn account.

132
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,800
It's sort of our signature

133
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,240
like we said when we started out.

134
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,520
Why do people need help with LinkedIn?

135
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,840
I know why I need help with LinkedIn,

136
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,600
but I want to know more

137
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,720
about the general public

138
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,440
why they need help with LinkedIn.

139
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,560
Well you'd be surprised.

140
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,200
There are a lot of people

141
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,800
that don't have LinkedIn.

142
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,040
They've been at companies for so long,

143
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,880
they never needed to.

144
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,920
They just got recruited

145
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,320
from company to company.

146
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,240
They never needed to do that.

147
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,160
And then, all of a sudden,

148
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,000
they're walked out the door that day.

149
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,280
All of their contacts

150
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,680
are on their work email,

151
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,280
and they've got to start all over again.

152
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,720
So not everyone has one.

153
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,600
But also a lot of people just,

154
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,400
they threw it up there.

155
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,480
Maybe they just copied

156
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,880
everything on their resume and they go,

157
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,000
"Okay. Good, I'm done. It's there."

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,320
They're hugely uncomfortable about it.

159
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,400
What should be there?

160
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,680
What shouldn't be there?

161
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,600
What should I do?

162
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,840
And this whole social media

163
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,560
for the socially reluctant

164
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,080
is what I call it

165
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,480
making yourself comfortable,

166
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,120
putting yourself out there online.

167
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,800
So not everybody is comfortable

168
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
knowing how to do that.

169
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,120
And then once you've got it there,

170
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,320
what do you do with it?

171
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,000
How do you build relationships,

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,920
connections?

173
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,350
Who should you connect with?

174
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,000
Some people say,

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,080
"Oh, I only connect with people

176
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,760
I really know well."

177
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,600
Well I don't know about you,

178
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,720
but that would maybe be

179
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,240
30, 50 people for me.

180
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,560
"Oh well, maybe I'll connect with people

181
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,440
I've worked with."

182
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:24,760
Maybe that would be

183
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,000
another hundred or so.

184
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,400
So, you need to find a comfortable way

185
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,640
to grow your network

186
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,160
and then a way

187
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,080
to use LinkedIn appropriately.

188
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,000
So, there's a lot of work in that.

189
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,560
A lot of people want to be seen

190
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,000
as a thought leader

191
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,560
or a manager of choice,

192
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,880
because just like managers

193
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,560
are looking at your LinkedIn profile

194
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,640
to consider hiring you,

195
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,960
you're looking at them and saying,

196
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,730
"Hey, do I want to work for this idiot?

197
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,120
Am I gonna get to work

198
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,440
on cool projects?

199
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,600
What's his career path?

200
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,040
Oh same job, five years.

201
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,320
That means no opportunities for me."

202
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,800
So it works both ways,

203
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,320
and a lot of people

204
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,760
they don't necessarily want a new job,

205
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,200
they want to be recognized

206
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,480
for their expertise.

207
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,400
So I work with all of them,

208
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,320
and I have way too much fun.

209
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,360
I shouldn't even call it work.

210
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,080
I just love it.

211
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,600
So, give me a little bit more insight

212
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,520
into the actual work that you do.

213
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,000
Do you go on Zoom with them

214
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,800
and you walk them through

215
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,160
section by section?

216
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,200
Do you draw on previous experiences?

217
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,760
Are there certain patterns

218
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,240
that you're seeing come up again?

219
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,000
What are you noticing?

220
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,040
Okay. Well, I do work on Zoom.

221
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,920
I screen share.

222
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,770
I do like a mini tutorial and overview,

223
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,160
best practices, ins-and-outs, weirdnesses.

224
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,880
There are a lot

225
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,200
of weirdnesses on LinkedIn.

226
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,880
And then I hand over the control to them

227
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,360
and watch over the shoulder

228
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,480
directing them to make changes.

229
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,560
But also putting them

230
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,000
in control of their profile.

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,240
A lot of times LinkedIn do things for you.

232
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,520
They set up defaults,

233
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,320
and you don't even know what's happened.

234
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,840
You have people like they think

235
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,120
they've got their picture there,

236
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,440
don't realize that they've got it set

237
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,160
so no one can actually see their picture

238
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,400
unless they're connected.

239
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,480
Or they've got everything,

240
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,520
their public view completely closed,

241
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,880
so it makes it very hard to find them.

242
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,800
So, I teach them.

243
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,880
I'm a teacher at heart.

244
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,480
Once a teacher, always a teacher.

245
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,360
And then, so I teach them how to do it

246
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,400
and then I polish it up

247
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,480
a little bit with them.

248
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,280
Sometimes they're uncomfortable.

249
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
It feels like bragging about themselves.

250
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,000
So, I help them find wording

251
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,080
that feels authentic and appropriate.

252
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,960
And then how to use this;

253
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,920
the physical how to post things

254
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,720
so that you get noticed as well as the

255
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,960
what should you post.

256
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,320
Why is nobody looking at it

257
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,080
when you're just

258
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,120
pushing stuff out there

259
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
that you think is great

260
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,280
and nobody cares?

261
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,840
Well, you've got to engage them

262
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,880
in conversation

263
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,520
not just push it out at them.

264
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,280
So, teaching them how to do that

265
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,800
is part of what I do also.

266
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,760
So Sandra, I think

267
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,920
it would be wonderful to hear

268
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,200
a few specific ideas

269
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,280
of what my friends and I could do

270
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,600
as we listen to this podcast

271
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
or this interview.

272
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,840
We go back to our LinkedIn.

273
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,400
What are some of the common pitfalls

274
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,920
that you see people are making

275
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,440
that first and foremost,

276
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,550
we should be avoiding?

277
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,040
Okay. Well, one of the most obvious

278
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,120
is your headline.

279
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,680
Right under your name, this area

280
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,280
it's actually called your headline.

281
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,960
But the default in LinkedIn

282
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,680
is when you add a new job,

283
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,480
[crosstalk]

284
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,200
... title into your headline.

285
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,640
It's not called your job title,

286
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,600
but LinkedIn does that to you, or for you

287
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,240
depending on how you're feeling about it.

288
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,200
And so you are so much more

289
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,560
than engineer at XYZ corporation, owner at

290
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,560
You want your keywords

291
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,200
plus something about what you do,

292
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,800
what you deliver to the company

293
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,520
as an employee,

294
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,680
or what you deliver and offer

295
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,600
as a business owner.

296
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,680
So, headline is the most important thing.

297
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,640
When you comment

298
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,680
on other people's content in LinkedIn,

299
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,480
your name and your headline show.

300
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,000
So it's like a free advertisement.

301
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,240
So that's the number one thing,

302
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,800
and it's always be true,

303
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,280
but continues to be true.

304
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,050
The other thing I would say-

305
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,920
So just one second about the headline,

306
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,760
because one of the things

307
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,920
that my friends and I have been wondering

308
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,200
is that we enjoy taking part

309
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,280
in a lot of different activities

310
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
that we're very proud of.

311
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,120
We work at a certain company.

312
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,080
We volunteer at a certain organization.

313
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,880
We study at a certain school.

314
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,760
Now, and then it stems the question,

315
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Yeah, we could write

316
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,360
a 50 character headline,

317
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,880
but at some point I'm sure that

318
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,080
there is a drawback

319
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,480
at having too much there.

320
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,600
Or trying to come across

321
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,000
as you're a little pushy.

322
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,480
Or that you're too much in marketing

323
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,800
and less in doing, right?

324
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,640
So, what is the balance

325
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,080
and how do you find that balance?

326
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,880
Oh, gosh.

327
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,520
That's the $50,000 question.

328
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,480
So, LinkedIn added the number

329
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,360
of characters you could have.

330
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,720
It used to be a 120 characters.

331
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,600
Mine is actually about 100

332
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
because I liked the way

333
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,160
it sat on two lines.

334
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,960
They've added now a 100 characters

335
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,400
so it's 220 characters

336
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,600
which is about four lines.

337
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,720
In general, I don't like headlines

338
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,960
that are that long.

339
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,600
If you give me too much to read,

340
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,920
I read nothing.

341
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,700
So, I would edit it down a bit.

342
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,240
A bit like with your advertising

343
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,520
on marketing grain,

344
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,040
what are the key things about you.

345
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,600
And there's an opportunity

346
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,960
in your about section to tell your story.

347
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,560
And that's where you can add in

348
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,080
some of this more interesting content.

349
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,800
But in the top, you want just enough

350
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,000
to identify your key skills,

351
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,720
maybe something

352
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,960
a little bit interesting about you

353
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,120
to make people want to connect.

354
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,240
What's different about you.

355
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,640
I mean if I see an invitation

356
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,720
to connect and it says,

357
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,440
"six figures in six weeks"

358
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,720
I know that he's gonna sell me

359
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,160
some automated product or ...

360
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,760
I don't even bother.

361
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,000
So that's obviously

362
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,840
too salesy, over the top.

363
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,120
You can talk about what you do.

364
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,800
I talk about

365
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,640
LinkedIn profiles for results

366
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,800
which hopefully describes what I do

367
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,240
but not being very pushy about it.

368
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,760
So you have to find that balance.

369
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,800
In general, I think

370
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,360
a couple of lines are enough.

371
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,880
Pick and choose what identifies you,

372
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,640
and then in your about section

373
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,360
tell me more.

374
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,520
Because the about section

375
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,400
has also changed.

376
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,320
It used to be,

377
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,680
we would go to your profile,

378
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,280
we would see the whole, used to be,

379
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,320
was it 1,500 characters.

380
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,600
I think it's grown to 2,000 now.

381
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,640
It's hard to keep track,

382
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,160
but do you really need that much.

383
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,360
And you used to see all of it,

384
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,440
and you could go there

385
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,560
and you could see someone's whole story

386
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,040
just by scanning it.

387
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,160
And that was great.

388
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,320
But we don't see that now.

389
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,100
We go to your profile.

390
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,240
We see the first three lines.

391
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,520
So, now you've got that

392
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,400
whole marketing advertising brain

393
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,640
you have to use again.

394
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,960
You've got to capture me

395
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,480
in those first three lines.

396
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,240
I don't know.

397
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,440
But you've been in Silicon Valley.

398
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,320
I don't reckon anybody

399
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,760
ever clicks on the see more.

400
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,080
So you've got to either have

401
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,280
your complete message

402
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,560
in the first three lines

403
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,800
and or be so intriguing

404
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,360
that we just got to open it

405
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,400
and read more about you.

406
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,200
So, how long does it take for you

407
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,640
to work with a person

408
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,280
to really understand who they are

409
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,640
and what special thing they have to offer

410
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,800
that would engage

411
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,920
with their other audience or other people

412
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,800
that they want to connect with?

413
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,160
Because it sounds to me

414
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,480
that a lot of this,

415
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,960
while there is the practical understanding

416
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,840
the character limit

417
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,520
and setting the settings correctly,

418
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,720
the real added value here

419
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,320
is understanding what,

420
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,160
in terms of marketing and messaging,

421
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,600
gets people to engage with your profile

422
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,720
and your posts, right?

423
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,320
Right. That's a great point.

424
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,280
And I use the expression,

425
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,440
"Walking is really just controlled falling"

426
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,280
The idea being you start to fall,

427
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,160
you put a foot there,

428
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,400
you catch yourself, you walk.

429
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,000
You start to fall, you pick your foot up.

430
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,920
So on social media,

431
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,160
especially for some of us

432
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,480
who are little more uncomfortable

433
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,880
about being online,

434
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,840
you've got to take a risk.

435
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,320
You've just got to be out there.

436
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,120
So, what I help people do

437
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,680
is be a little brave

438
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,000
and pick the words, for now,

439
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,680
this is not a lifetime commitment,

440
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,600
this is not marriage.

441
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,760
This is just pick what's true for now.

442
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,800
So, I will help people identify

443
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,840
what feels right for them right now

444
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,840
knowing that they're not

445
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,600
stuck with it, they can change it.

446
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,080
And just being a little bit brave

447
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,200
to do that.

448
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,480
And that's really hard for people.

449
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,920
So, sometimes if you go

450
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,400
for counseling or psychotherapy,

451
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,640
you go for months, years, whatever.

452
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,360
I work with people for two hours,

453
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,640
and we get it done.

454
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,280
And sometimes people will come back to me

455
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,880
for additional help,

456
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,080
but for the most part,

457
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,320
you know who you are right now.

458
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,560
Let's pick those words.

459
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,480
Try it out, throw it out there,

460
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,620
and walk on.

461
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,600
I'm not gonna let you do

462
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,360
anything embarrassing or wrong,

463
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
but it's okay.

464
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,800
Take a risk. Use a word.

465
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,120
I'm working with a lot

466
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,840
of executive coaches these days.

467
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,800
I'm taking an executive coaching program.

468
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,000
I've learned that that's probably

469
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,200
not the right thing for me

470
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,080
because coaching

471
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,240
you're supposed to just listen,

472
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,960
and want to help you get it done.

473
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,800
So, it may not be the right thing for me.

474
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,000
But I work a lot with them.

475
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And there's a coach, he's so good

476
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,360
and he works on a particular kind

477
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,920
of harmonic leadership

478
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,080
which is rather unique.

479
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,680
Does everybody know what it is? No.

480
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,000
But maybe they're gonna be intrigued

481
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,440
and ask him.

482
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,640
So, be brave is kind of what I teach.

483
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,840
I think is my value add.

484
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,600
So then, the other sections

485
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,720
that we didn't get to touch upon,

486
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,520
which I believe is the experience,

487
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,120
the volunteer, the awards.

488
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,480
These sections are

489
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,600
on the bottom of the page.

490
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,120
I personally haven't spent much time

491
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,040
discussing the different organizations

492
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,360
that I volunteer my time for,

493
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,280
the different awards that I received,

494
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,000
mainly because in my perception,

495
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,760
most people are just

496
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,120
not gonna scroll that far down.

497
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,480
Maybe I have the wrong perception,

498
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,520
but talk to me about these other sections.

499
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,360
Are they important?

500
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,760
And if so, what is the right positioning

501
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,280
as we approach them?

502
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah. Well, some of it's

503
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,880
like finding conversation starters.

504
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,960
So when you go to someone's profile,

505
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,440
if you are both members

506
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,960
of a group or an association

507
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,160
under the highlight section,

508
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,440
which is right near the top,

509
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,840
it says that you're both members

510
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,240
of this group or association.

511
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,040
So right away

512
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,680
you've now got a conversation starter.

513
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,640
So, that's a really great way to use it.

514
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,560
If I do scroll down in your profile

515
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:22,280
and I see, oh, you volunteer your time

516
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,920
with the Boy Scouts of America

517
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,760
whatever it is, we've now, it's like,

518
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,440
Oh, my kid was in Boy Scouts.

519
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,440
You've got something to talk about.

520
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,800
So, we're constantly looking

521
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,520
for things you have in common.

522
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,880
My goal on LinkedIn

523
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,000
is never just to make a connection;

524
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,600
it's always to start a conversation,

525
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,080
a conversation that might lead

526
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,400
to a relationship.

527
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,200
And a relationship, if I'm lucky,

528
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,680
might lead to the privilege

529
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,680
of doing business with them.

530
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,000
For someone in my world,

531
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,680
my network is actually quite small.

532
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,880
I've got about 5,000 or so connections.

533
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,400
And that sounds a lot to some people,

534
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,440
but again, in my world, that's small.

535
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,320
But that's because

536
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,040
I don't want to just have numbers.

537
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,600
I actually want to have

538
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,360
real conversations with people.

539
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,920
And I do. I connected with

540
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,480
one of your former speakers

541
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,320
after watching her talk.
- Oh, wonderful.

542
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,080
I told her why I was connecting with her,

543
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,520
and now we started a conversation

544
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,160
about wine.

545
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,960
I love it. I just love it.

546
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,200
And is there an added benefit

547
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,560
in having more followers?

548
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,680
Because I see some people have

549
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,600
tens of thousands of followers.

550
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,480
Other people have 800.

551
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,240
What are the pros and cons

552
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,200
of having that very public appearance

553
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,520
of how many people you're connected with?

554
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,760
And a clarification,

555
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,520
which I need for myself, when it says

556
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,040
the number of followers on a page,

557
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,240
is that the number of connections

558
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,040
or just the number of people

559
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,680
that are interested in your profile?

560
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,960
It's a combination.

561
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,480
LinkedIn often uses

562
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,440
the language interchangeably.

563
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,400
Your connections are actually

564
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
the people you're directly

565
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,280
first degree connections with.

566
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,960
Your followers are people

567
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,960
who choose to follow you

568
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,440
because they want to see your content,

569
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,400
but you may not be connected with them.

570
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,320
So, I've got about the 5,000 connections

571
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,440
and maybe another thousand followers,

572
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,840
because I write content about LinkedIn

573
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,440
and people want to see that.

574
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,560
But in other places

575
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,080
it combines those two numbers.

576
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,760
So, if I look at your profile

577
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,840
and I see the number of followers,

578
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,280
that would be the combination.

579
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,240
In your case, probably most of them

580
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,000
are actually connections.

581
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,840
So the number, the magic number.

582
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,760
So there is some value, algorithmically,

583
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,120
is there even such a word,

584
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,160
in having over 500 connections. It makes it,

585
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,480
I just worked with somebody yesterday,

586
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,800
brand new user. He's been in an industry

587
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,000
where he wasn't allowed to be on LinkedIn.

588
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,040
So he literally started from scratch,

589
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
no connections.

590
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,800
And I tried to find examples

591
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,440
for him to look at,

592
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,040
and LinkedIn wouldn't let him

593
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,120
look at those examples

594
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,640
because his reach was not big enough.

595
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,400
So, of course, once he connected with me,

596
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,840
he's now only two degrees away

597
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
from my 5,000.

598
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,000
That just alone gives him more access.

599
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So, let's say 500 at least

600
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,920
just to make it easy to find people.

601
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,600
In general, I say people should have

602
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,240
at least 30 connections

603
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,800
for every year of their age.

604
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,360
So I'll let you do your own math.

605
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,320
You're a young man, so that's easy.

606
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,440
I look at some people,

607
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,920
and I see the look of panic

608
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,240
in their eyes as they realize

609
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,800
what that number is.

610
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,120
And the reason I use that number

611
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,240
is because you meet 30 people

612
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,400
professionally a year, I'm sure.

613
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,720
Why would you not connect with them

614
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,440
on LinkedIn?

615
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,720
So, that's like a starting point.

616
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,280
If you're in business development,

617
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,800
you're gonna want

618
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,760
a bigger number than that.

619
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,920
If you want to be a thought leader

620
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,160
and get your content.

621
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,200
When you write content on LinkedIn,

622
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,800
you write a post, it actually goes out

623
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,360
to only maybe 10%

624
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,200
of all of your connections.

625
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,600
And they only see it in their newsfeed

626
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,720
if they happen to be looking

627
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,800
at that time.

628
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,440
So 10% of 5,000

629
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,920
is better than 10% better of 500.

630
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,560
Now, you can increase that number

631
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,200
from 10% to more like 25%,

632
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,640
that's about the max,

633
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,080
by engaging on LinkedIn,

634
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,080
the more you're active on LinkedIn.

635
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,800
And that would be the other big thing

636
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,120
I would tell people.

637
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,640
You need to be engaged on LinkedIn.

638
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,960
My name, Sandra Clark,

639
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
it's actually very common.

640
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,120
There's more than a thousand of me,

641
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,160
not ... look like me.

642
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,400
But, in general, if you put my name,

643
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
Sandra Clark, in the search bar,

644
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,320
I am gonna come up

645
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,160
as one of the top six

646
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,440
suggested Sandra Clarks in the world

647
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,160
because LinkedIn's algorithm says,

648
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,960
Hey, you're looking for a Sandra Clark,

649
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,920
really good chance you're looking

650
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,040
for this crazy lady

651
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,520
because she's active on LinkedIn.

652
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,160
And the guy who I was worked with yesterday,

653
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,680
who had no connections, did that,

654
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,520
and I came up first.

655
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,720
I love it. I just love it.

656
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,720
Sandra, 20 minutes go by fast

657
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,880
but I definitely learned a lot

658
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,920
and I have to go back and fix a few things

659
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,660
on my own LinkedIn.

660
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,770
Oh, I'll be looking.

661
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,480
Thank you very much for the insights

662
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,400
and for being so generous with your time.

663
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,000
Before we leave,

664
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,320
I have to ask you my favorite question

665
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,520
which is three words that you would use

666
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,040
to describe yourself.

667
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,000
Okay. I overthought this a little,

668
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,640
but the obvious ones for me

669
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,720
are mentor and empathetic.

670
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,960
And after watching Mor Eini's interview,

671
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,440
I have to join her with white wine.

672
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,960
I love it. I just love it.

673
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,480
Thank you very, very much Sandra.

674
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,560
This is wonderful.

675
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,960
And stay safe and stay healthy

676
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
especially with all the fires

677
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,040
that are happening today.

678
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,360
Will do. Thank you so much.

679
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,120
A pleasure talking with you.

680
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Wonderful. Bye bye.
