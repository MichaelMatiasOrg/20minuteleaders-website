1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,040
But you have to realize

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,120
that first, it's not enough

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,160
and you have to be

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,120
very much conscious

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,560
of not getting in love too much

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,360
with your idea,

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,633
especially, with your solution.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,560
Chen Shmilo, thank you so much

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,400
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,040
How are you?

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,480
Good.

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,520
How are you, Michael?

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,120
Thank you so much for having me.

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,040
Thank you very much

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,280
for spending time here.

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,920
I know how busy you are

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,320
making a lot of impact.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,040
And that's what I want

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,960
to talk about today, impact.

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,160
The impact that you're making right now

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,200
is in the context of 8200 impact.

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,160
And I can't wait to hear all about that.

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,360
But your journey is just

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,400
as fascinating as the work

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,920
that you're doing now.

26
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,443
And I know that you want to focus

27
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:10,360
a lot on the impact of this organization.

28
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,560
But I have to ask you

29
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,920
a little bit about yourself

30
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,280
and a little bit about your upbringing.

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,400
Start all the way back

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,600
to when you were leading

33
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,360
the course group

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,640
in your elementary school.

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,960
And then, zip forward all the way

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,960
to your public work

37
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,320
moving to the private sector.

38
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,800
Go ahead, Chen.

39
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,490
Yeah. That's sounds really

40
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,760
a  nice, fun fact. Right?

41
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,960
So, besides singing,

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,480
and it was only until Elementary School

43
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,040
you know, when my voice changed

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,000
then my plans have changed, too.

45
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,320
But I've always wanted

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,920
to be socially involved

47
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,000
and to lead social activism

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,200
wherever I was.

49
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,680
So, even studying in high school

50
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,360
when I was the head

51
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,920
of the student council,

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,520
then through initiating

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,040
a special project during

54
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,040
my military service at 8200 units,

55
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,600
and through my university experience

56
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,440
when I went to law school

57
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,320
in Haifa University

58
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,800
and I was the head

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,760
of the students board there,

60
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,880
it was always about using my skills,

61
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,120
knowledge, passion

62
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,460
to make things happen and change

63
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:29,000
whatever there is to change and fix.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,760
So, this is basically who I am.

65
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,040
So, whenever I need to choose

66
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,160
my next step in my career path,

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,280
I'm always looking at the intersection

68
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,120
of what I know to do

69
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,400
and what I desire to do.

70
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,440
And I hope to find, you know,

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,400
the right meeting point,

72
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,680
the right intersection between

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,560
these two elements.

74
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,520
And this has led me

75
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,080
through pretty much diverse

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,320
positions till now.

77
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,800
And the reason is

78
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,720
being the managing director of 8200

79
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,480
impact acceleration program.

80
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:06,720
Right.

81
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,400
But before we get

82
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,880
to the 8200 impact program,

83
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,200
I have to talk a little bit about

84
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,400
this dissonance between

85
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,600
the public and private sector.

86
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,160
So, Chen, you're telling me

87
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,760
that the way that you grew up,

88
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,400
you are always looking for ways

89
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,120
to make an impact, right?

90
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,600
It's always been,

91
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,280
how can I find

92
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,160
a connection between

93
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,960
what I want to do

94
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,680
and what I can do

95
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,880
to make that impact.

96
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,120
You become a lawyer

97
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,800
and you go into the public

98
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,720
and NGO sector

99
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,440
trying to affect change

100
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,080
in your community.

101
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,160
So, tell me a little bit about

102
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,200
this motivation to affect change,

103
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,040
and sort of your realization

104
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,760
and transition from the public

105
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,760
to the private sector.

106
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,200
So, I think it started

107
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,560
during my internship.

108
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,280
And I did my legal internship

109
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,720
in one of the biggest law firms

110
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,960
here in Tel Aviv.

111
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,160
And was a really high quality

112
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,120
practice there, but I didn't really

113
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,680
feel connected to the mission.

114
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,520
And it was defending

115
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,680
and providing legal services

116
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,160
to really big corporations,

117
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,920
big private market entities.

118
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,880
And I couldn't feel

119
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,400
how we're changing the world

120
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,000
by providing them with legal services.

121
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,840
And there was even a specific case

122
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,000
where I understood the legal case,

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,320
it was pretty much obvious

124
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,200
what should be

125
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,760
the money that should be paid

126
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,240
to the other partner of the side

127
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,400
that we represented.

128
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And yet we had to spend months and months

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,920
in district court in the north,

130
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,960
you know, hiring over

131
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,560
a very pretty much

132
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,520
small amount of money.

133
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,200
And I said, "Okay,

134
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,920
this is not my destiny."

135
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,200
And so, I was fortunate enough

136
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,080
after finishing my internship

137
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,200
and getting my lawyer license,

138
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,520
to be a legislative aide to the Knesset.

139
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,400
And I was like, you know,

140
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,000
big fortune to work

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,040
with former MK Dalia Itzik

142
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,600
in her last term

143
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,960
after she concluded her position

144
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,080
as the speaker of the Knesset

145
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,440
and was the head of the Kadima faction.

146
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,320
And even though it was quite

147
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,680
a short period of time, I learned a lot.

148
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,480
And working at the Knesset,

149
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,960
amending or proposing bills

150
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,480
to amend the law,

151
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,800
using my knowledge as a tourist

152
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,880
to pursue social changes,

153
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,840
I really liked it.

154
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,400
And so, there after the elections

155
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,680
back in 2013, I started to work

156
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,680
at the Israeli Medical Association

157
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,360
as their public policy director.

158
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,080
And this is where I had the chance

159
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,440
to promote public health issues

160
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,120
and represent the physicians

161
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,080
at the Knesset committees.

162
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,760
And this is,

163
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,320
you know, except of the best experience

164
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,480
that you gain working with leaders

165
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,600
of the physician world

166
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,360
and working with MKs with the government,

167
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,960
you also have the opportunities

168
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,600
to promote things that you believe in.

169
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,120
And that was the right place

170
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,800
for me back then.

171
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,600
Right.

172
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,400
But at some point, when I return

173
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,440
from the Humphrey Fellowship,

174
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,617
I was a food writer in the US,

175
00:06:38,618 --> 00:06:40,130
spent almost a year

176
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:41,720
in Richmond, Virginia

177
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,880
focusing on public health management.

178
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,160
I came back,

179
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:47,720
I started being the CEO

180
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,840
of the non profit

181
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,520
in the health care system.

182
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,200
I managed to include

183
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,480
very important medicine,

184
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,320
preventive medicine

185
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,640
in the basic health

186
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,200
basket here in Israel, called PrEP.

187
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,440
Pre-exposure prophylaxis

188
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,080
that prevents HIV transmission.

189
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,680
But I also realized at the time that

190
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,560
there's something broken in the system.

191
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
It takes so much time.

192
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,480
You have to pull so many strings.

193
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,720
And I think, you know,

194
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,000
covid-19 pandemic now

195
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,120
is actually highlighted

196
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,240
what I started to realize

197
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,600
and feel even before

198
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,280
the pandemic started,

199
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,880
and that there has to be some kind

200
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,600
of a game changer in this world

201
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,120
so we have a more balanced economy,

202
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,040
more opportunities

203
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,920
for diverse population.

204
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,160
This is where I started to aim

205
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,280
at working in the private sector

206
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,720
and specifically just to pursue change.

207
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,960
So, in just a few sentences,

208
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,080
how do you summarize that realization,

209
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,400
that of the impact that you're able

210
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,360
to make in the private sector

211
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,280
versus the public sector?

212
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,880
Because I hear of a lot of people

213
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,240
that go from the private sector

214
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,200
to the public sector to effect change

215
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,240
because they're saying

216
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,080
the real power lies

217
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,640
in the decision makers,

218
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,360
in the government

219
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,800
and the NGOs, et cetera,

220
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
not in the private sector.

221
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:16,280
Yet Chen, you're saying I want to make

222
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,880
the biggest impact I can

223
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,320
so, I'm actually transitioning

224
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,000
from my work

225
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,280
in the public to the private.

226
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,360
Am I getting that right?

227
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,920
Yes, you are.

228
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,000
Well, the thing is that I think

229
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,080
the role of the government,

230
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,800
the role of the state actually

231
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,560
varies from one situation to another.

232
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,520
And sometimes,

233
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,520
the only thing the government needs to do

234
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,160
is not to intervene.

235
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,360
Sometimes it can be

236
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,800
the catalyst for helping

237
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,680
other organizations to make the change.

238
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,560
They can be a partner, sometimes.

239
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,560
They can be the regulator.

240
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,840
But I think and I truly believe

241
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,280
that the pandemic is highlighted

242
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,960
this notion, they are not as strong

243
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,400
as I used to think they are.

244
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,120
Public are the regulators.

245
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,480
So, the balance and the role is shifting.

246
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,840
And I don't think we can ignore them.

247
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,280
Absolutely not.

248
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,000
But I mean, look at everything.

249
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,560
Nobody could have done it better

250
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,240
than the private market

251
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,600
in collaboration and cooperation

252
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
with governments.

253
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,419
That should be

254
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,840
implemented in other fields to.

255
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,760
That makes perfect sense.

256
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,800
So, given that realization

257
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,840
and given that understanding

258
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,640
and your motivation,

259
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,400
talk to me a little bit about

260
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,720
what you're spending so much

261
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,680
of your time now,

262
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
making an impact through

263
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,400
the 8200 impact project.

264
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,520
What is the vision

265
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,240
and what's actually happening today?

266
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,400
Right.

267
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,080
So, we're actually affiliated

268
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,200
with the 8200 Alumni Association.

269
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,520
And it's part of our goal

270
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,760
to harness the human capital

271
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,160
of the alumni of the unit

272
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,400
for the sake of the economy and society,

273
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,040
we've created several exertion programs.

274
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,280
I run the 8200 impact

275
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,880
acceleration program,

276
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,200
which supports technological ventures

277
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,920
or what we call now,

278
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,320
impact tech startups.

279
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,920
Impact tech startups are different

280
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,800
by three criteria points of categories.

281
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,360
The first one is the intentionality test,

282
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,760
is whether they have initiated

283
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,080
the whole venture startup company

284
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,080
in order to make significant change

285
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,600
and to support significant social

286
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
or environmental problem.

287
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,560
How do you measure that?

288
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,040
How do you measure

289
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,600
intentionality amongst, you know,

290
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,800
early stage founders

291
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,760
that are just now beginning

292
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,280
their journey?

293
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,680
That's a wonderful question.

294
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,360
Usually by their statements.

295
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,040
Usually, by the way

296
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,320
they stick to their intention

297
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,640
throughout the process,

298
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,960
even though it is harder

299
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,520
to be in impact tech entrepreneur.

300
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,640
It is harder to find a business model,

301
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,080
it is harder to find investments.

302
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,200
In many cases, your beneficiaries

303
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,360
are not your clients

304
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,240
because your beneficiaries

305
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,320
are coming from disadvantaged communities

306
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,472
that cannot afford

307
00:11:25,473 --> 00:11:27,360
paying for your product.

308
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,240
And then it becomes more complicated.

309
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,800
If they stick to the intention,

310
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,760
if they talk about what they do

311
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,640
in terms of not just making profit,

312
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,560
which is great,

313
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,600
and they have to make profit of course,

314
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,800
especially those who are aiming

315
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,560
at being a startup company,

316
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,120
but then talking about measuring

317
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,800
the social impact

318
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,000
and it has to be embedded

319
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,880
within the product.

320
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,640
Then if this test

321
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,280
is they're doing okay

322
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,360
with the first test of intentionality.

323
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,320
Right.

324
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,200
It is not a clear cut.

325
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,000
I mean, still black and white.

326
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,920
And sometimes people

327
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,280
are doing the social worship

328
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,760
just stating they care about impact,

329
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,960
about society or environment.

330
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,520
But at the bottom line, they're not.

331
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,120
So, you test along the way.

332
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,480
Right.

333
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,160
Okay, so that's the first test.

334
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,840
And walk me through

335
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,920
some of the other criteria

336
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,680
of how you are observing

337
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,760
these entrepreneurs.

338
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,600
The second one is whether they intend

339
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,200
and they have the ability to measure it.

340
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,520
So, we're looking at the measurable social

341
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,200
or environmental impact.

342
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,360
Usually at this stage,

343
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,200
we use this the SDG,

344
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,920
the Sustainable Development Goals

345
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,560
of the UN.

346
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,160
And it's not a perfect method.

347
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,080
But so far,

348
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,640
things are happening in this field.

349
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,400
So, we're using the SDGs mostly.

350
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,920
And the third one is, you know,

351
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,080
the financial revenue.

352
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,160
Whether they can be

353
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,560
a good fit for mainstream VCs,

354
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,480
of impact VCs, angel.

355
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,840
Whether they can come up

356
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,720
with a really good idea

357
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,480
and then product, the people

358
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,720
would want to invest in.

359
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,080
Right.

360
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,960
And combination of the three criteria,

361
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,760
it's pretty much complicated.

362
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,720
So, when you do accept people

363
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,320
into this cohort

364
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,960
or into this group and program,

365
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,920
what actually happens?

366
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,120
How do you actually help

367
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,800
these impact entrepreneurs

368
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,160
that you now call them

369
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,520
progressing to their, you know,

370
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,840
make it actually happen?

371
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,560
Yeah. So, it's a five-month program.

372
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,840
We usually select each year

373
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,680
between 10 to 12

374
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,960
entrepreneurs or ventures.

375
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,720
Some of them operated as a company.

376
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,520
Some are not at that stage.

377
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,760
We provide them with

378
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,720
a weekly day of workshops and lectures.

379
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,280
A very intensive mentorship program.

380
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,480
They have lead mentors,

381
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,240
professional mentors, office hours

382
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,200
and virtual board meetings.

383
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,600
You know, kind of tailor made

384
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,600
specific services plan

385
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,320
for each entrepreneur,

386
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,600
depending on the stage they're at,

387
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,440
depending on their current needs.

388
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,520
And I have to make sure

389
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,840
that I create for them the right space

390
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,000
to do amazing things.

391
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,400
Right.

392
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,600
Including connect and material support.

393
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,000
Sometimes even credits from

394
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,880
big corporation that can help them

395
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,400
do what they do

396
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,400
in a much faster pace.

397
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,520
And at the end,

398
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,880
we have a really

399
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
big event showcase event,

400
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,280
or annual demo day

401
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,520
in which they're being exposed

402
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,720
or investors are being exposed

403
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,840
to our portfolio companies.

404
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,320
Right.

405
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,280
So, tell me a little bit about the impact

406
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,040
that 8200 impact is making

407
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,600
and how do you measure that impact?

408
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,200
Are you a shareholder

409
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,680
or stakeholder in these companies?

410
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,160
What is sort of the relationship

411
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,480
that you have with the entrepreneurs

412
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,920
that are coming?

413
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,840
So, our model is a philanthropic one.

414
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,640
We don't charge anything.

415
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,560
We don't invest.

416
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,760
I mean, we don't get any equity.

417
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,800
We do have a board of partners

418
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,440
who are actually our sponsors

419
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,200
and they actually create the budgets

420
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,000
that we work with.

421
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,440
The way we measure our stuff,

422
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
that's a really good question, you know.

423
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,720
The program is now,

424
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,600
we're nearing the end

425
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,120
of the sixth batch.

426
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,640
So far, in the survey

427
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,680
that we conducted very much recently,

428
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,120
we have the figures of

429
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,520
the accumulated investment sum of money

430
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,560
of our companies

431
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,800
is a little bit more than $45 million.

432
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,160
And our startups have created

433
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,160
more than 100 jobs in Israel,

434
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,440
but not only in Israel.

435
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,880
Which is pretty much a common criteria

436
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,040
to measure an acceleration program.

437
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,000
We also asked them about

438
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,520
whether they measure their social impact

439
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,560
and then see,

440
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,040
you know, accordingly,

441
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,440
if we can also present

442
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,360
any progress with specific SDGs.

443
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:38,600
Right.

444
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,800
It's not that easy

445
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,360
for an early stage startup.

446
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,560
But we do see

447
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,200
some progressing relating to SDGs.

448
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,520
We're also adopting other methods

449
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,400
of management within

450
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,880
the startup company of diversity

451
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,400
and accessibility for people

452
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,880
with disability

453
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
and other criteria

454
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,360
that are more common

455
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,840
in impact tech ventures.

456
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,880
I think that makes perfect sense.

457
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,743
So Chen, I'd love to spend

458
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:08,440
the last few minutes

459
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,240
that we have talking

460
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,920
a little more broadly about impact

461
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,120
and some lessons

462
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,280
that you can provide

463
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,600
to young entrepreneurs,

464
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,040
whether they're in Tel Aviv

465
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
and can take part in

466
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,720
or in Israel and can take part

467
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,000
in this great program

468
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,080
or outside around the world.

469
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,040
What are some of the lessons

470
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,720
that you've learned along the way

471
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,480
of that make up

472
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,000
a successful impact venture?

473
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,680
Or at least a successful enough

474
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,280
to be able to take roots

475
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,200
and grow even passed

476
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,240
the first milestone

477
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,760
of the formation of it?

478
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Wonderful question.

479
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,600
Well, first, being

480
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,840
an impact tech entrepreneur

481
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,800
is well, it starts with

482
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,600
being an entrepreneur.

483
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,400
And here I have no news.

484
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,560
You have to learn the whole

485
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,280
you know, the whole system.

486
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,560
Maybe people can read your book

487
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,880
that was recently published.

488
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,760
It starts with the notion

489
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,960
that you want to be an entrepreneur

490
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,760
you are courage enough.

491
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,000
Really.

492
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,320
Sometimes, maybe people will say

493
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,160
you're crazy enough

494
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,880
to start this amazing but

495
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:14,880
very very painful journey.

496
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,920
So, you have to be very much

497
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:18,160
passionate about it.

498
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,560
The second one that

499
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,280
you have to know

500
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,040
that making a positive impact

501
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,680
is not something

502
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,040
that has to do only with

503
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,160
being a purpose driven entrepreneur.

504
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,120
It is a whole system

505
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,080
where you also have to measure it.

506
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
Right.

507
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,200
The third thing I would say,

508
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,920
well, in many cases,

509
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,960
our entrepreneurs that we support,

510
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,760
have a very strong connection

511
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,840
between the product

512
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,680
and their personal life.

513
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,480
Interesting.

514
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,080
Sometimes,

515
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,200
a really interesting advantage.

516
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,160
Sometimes it could be very challenging.

517
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,760
So, for example, female entrepreneur,

518
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,760
that at some point

519
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,040
had a very negative experience

520
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,880
whether in terms of domestic violence

521
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,320
or feeling unsafe in public places

522
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,120
and she comes up

523
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,080
with a brilliant idea of creating

524
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,760
you know, an app that enhances

525
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,000
the feeling of being safe on the streets.

526
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,840
That could be an advantage.

527
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,560
I think that can really strengthen

528
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,960
your passion along the way.

529
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,840
But you have to realize

530
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,920
that first, it's not enough

531
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,960
and you have to be

532
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,920
very much conscious

533
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,360
of not getting in love too much

534
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,240
with your ideas,

535
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,400
especially with your solution.

536
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,800
I think that's, yeah,

537
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,560
I think that's a wonderful point

538
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,040
that you're making.

539
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,600
We actually had

540
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,880
a really brilliant guest.

541
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,240
I think she's episode 190 something,

542
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,680
Anita Kumari.

543
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,680
And she founded The Happiness Factor.

544
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,360
And she founded it as a result

545
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:09,920
of a very abusive relationship

546
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,960
that she had coming from India

547
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,640
into a marriage that was unsuccessful.

548
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,320
A very abusive marriage.

549
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,640
And she founded an organization

550
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,040
to help women gain confidence and support

551
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,160
for dealing with these things.

552
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,560
And so, I definitely see the value

553
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,560
and being very connected to the product

554
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
on an emotional level,

555
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,160
especially when

556
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,480
you are talking about impact.

557
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,720
The other thing that I want

558
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,840
to reiterate is you're mentioning

559
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,160
of both being intentional

560
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,404
but being measurable.

561
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,360
That you know, just because

562
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,560
you're making a social impact

563
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
and you're doing social good

564
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,920
often with impact,

565
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,520
it doesn't mean that you

566
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,720
should allow yourself

567
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,000
to not measure your process

568
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,840
and measure whether you're able

569
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,360
to continue making that impact.

570
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,040
Just like any regular venture

571
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,000
where you have to, you know,

572
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,560
you can sometimes measure sales

573
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,440
and measure your revenue

574
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,880
or your burn rate,

575
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,840
here and maybe you don't need

576
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,600
to measure sales,

577
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,080
but you do want to measure

578
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,920
whether the impact you're making

579
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,000
is growing because that is

580
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,040
the equivalent of sales

581
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,040
for regular venture.

582
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,840
You actually want to measure both.

583
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,280
And that what makes it more complicated.

584
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,040
So, you want to measure your sales,

585
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,280
you want to show fraction.

586
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
You want to show

587
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,960
that you're moving

588
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,520
the needle in terms of

589
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,320
the specific social challenge.

590
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,560
Wow. That makes a lot of sense.

591
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,520
Chen, I want to thank you

592
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,040
for being so generous with your time.

593
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
There's more

594
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,000
that I wanted to talk about,

595
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,680
but we don't have enough time for that.

596
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,960
So, we'll have to do another episode

597
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,840
in the future.

598
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,600
But before we leave,

599
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,360
I have to ask you

600
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,600
for the most important question,

601
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,240
which is three words

602
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,960
that you would use to describe yourself.

603
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,800
It's the hardest question.

604
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,600
Of course.

605
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,800
I would say passionate.

606
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,960
I can't work with passionate people,

607
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,600
unless I'm passionate myself

608
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,480
about what I do.

609
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,000
I hope I'm genuine enough.

610
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,920
And then other two words,

611
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,040
maybe three phrases

612
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,120
and not three words,

613
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,080
social activist.

614
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:10,200
I truly believe, even being now

615
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,920
in this intersection of business

616
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,200
and making an impact,

617
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,840
I truly believe that

618
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,560
we are doing social activism

619
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,760
in an innovative way.

620
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,400
I love it.

621
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,800
Chen, thank you very, very much.

622
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,280
This is wonderful.

623
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,760
Continue making a positive impact

624
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,800
and continue helping others

625
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,240
make a positive impact.

626
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,480
And I can't wait to share this

627
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:35,880
with the world.

628
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,560
Thank you very much.

629
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,920
Toda raba.

630
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,120
Wonderful.

631
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,920
Thank you, Michael.
