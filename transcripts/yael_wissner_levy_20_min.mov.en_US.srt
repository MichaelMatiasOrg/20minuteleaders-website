1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,600
My goal was always to be in the UN.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,080
I thought I was going to be a diplomat.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,920
I threw that in the trash.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,440
But the storytelling aspect of it all,

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,040
I think, does actually run deep.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,040
And there is a real common denominator

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,880
between the things that I've done.

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,520
Yael Wissner Levy,

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,720
thank you so much for being on my show,

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,920
I'm so incredibly excited

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,880
to have you here.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,600
I am too.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,440
Thanks for having me, Michael.

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:53,960
I've been waiting

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,000
for this for a long time.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,560
You're one of the most wanted

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,480
high tech entrepreneurs,

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,680
communications writers,

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,600
whatever you want to call it

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,120
in the world,

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,800
because the work

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,080
that you've been doing with,

23
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,840
well, yes, it just shows,

24
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,800
by me getting a hold of you,

25
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,040
and every person that I talk to

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,360
says how amazing you are.

27
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,600
Because the work that you've done

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,520
with Lemonade,

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,240
with being vice president

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,920
of communications there in the company,

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,120
that is revolutionizing the way that

32
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,240
content is being delivered

33
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,640
in the world of insurance.

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,640
And I'm now in the insurance space

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,360
with Hippo Insurance.

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,840
So, I get to appreciate

37
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,320
this art of communications

38
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,600
and content there, it's remarkable.

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,080
But I actually know you

40
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,040
back from your speech writing days.

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,640
And previously, as a news anchor.

42
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,680
So, you have a breadth of experience.

43
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,600
in the world of communications.

44
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,080
Yael, take me back to the good old days.

45
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,720
You're back with Channel 10 News

46
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,360
and then i24 News,

47
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,400
why journalism?

48
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,360
Why communications?

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,120
I will take you definitely back.

50
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,200
But I have to comment on those crazy,

51
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,680
crazy compliment you gave earlier.

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,040
I can't take any of the credit.

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,240
I work with an incredible team.

54
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,680
And I know Hippo also

55
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,520
has a really outstanding team.

56
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,360
But here at Lemonade,

57
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,400
I've been fortunate enough to work with

58
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,920
really the best entrepreneurs,

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,280
I think, on the planet.

60
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,440
And learning from them

61
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,320
and just kind of

62
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,440
being here for five years,

63
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,240
I'm actually celebrating

64
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,280
my five year anniversary

65
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,960
here at Lemonade.

66
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,120
It has been an unbelievable journey

67
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,160
on a personal level.

68
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,400
5 years. Wow.

69
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,920
Yeah, but also on a professional level,

70
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,200
really working side by side

71
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,440
with the top of the best.

72
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,840
Like really, really top talent.

73
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,080
But we'll get to that.

74
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,960
And yeah, as you mentioned,

75
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,960
I had an unorthodox way

76
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,840
of jumping into the tech scene.

77
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,360
But I like to say that if you look back

78
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,600
and try to connect the dots,

79
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,080
it's actually very clear.

80
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,280
It just wasn't clear at the time.

81
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,240
When I was in my 20's

82
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,120
and I was going through, as you said,

83
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,040
journalism to politics,

84
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,240
back to journalism, back to politics.

85
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
And it looks like

86
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,000
I was like hopping around.

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,680
Whereas I feel like

88
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,200
I was just diving deeper and deeper

89
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,440
into this world of storytelling.

90
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,440
And storytelling is actually,

91
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,760
the elements of it are pretty basic.

92
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,400
And you put it in journalism

93
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,320
or you put it in politics

94
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,640
or you put it in tech,

95
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,000
and the very kind of elements

96
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,840
and the fundamentals

97
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,000
of storytelling are the same.

98
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,280
And I started my storytelling experience,

99
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,840
if you will,

100
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,320
right after the army here in Israel.

101
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,720
Actually, even before.

102
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,560
Like I was,

103
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,280
I grew up in a home that was

104
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,800
very much of a storyteller's home,

105
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,160
books and stories.

106
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,480
And my mother is a teacher, as you know,

107
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,360
where part of the everyday life.

108
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,360
And I always like to write.

109
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,720
And kind of delve into that.

110
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,480
After the Army,

111
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,880
I worked in the US Congress

112
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,760
for a Democrat from New York.

113
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,520
And that's where I was exposed

114
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,240
for the first time to storytelling

115
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,320
kind of as a profession,

116
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,600
that was beyond just like the,

117
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,880
what I had known before that

118
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,000
as authors and so forth.

119
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,120
Suddenly, I saw all of these

120
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,120
members of Congress that would come

121
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,240
into the Senate or the House,

122
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,600
and they wouldn't say a word

123
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,840
without having their speechwriter

124
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,600
write it for them.

125
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,920
And it wasn't because

126
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,880
they were incompetent.

127
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,480
They were actually,

128
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,200
they're extremely

129
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,360
incompetent individuals.

130
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,880
And I was lucky enough to work with

131
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,440
Representative

132
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,160
Steve Israel from New York.

133
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,840
But they understood the power of the word

134
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,800
and the power of everything

135
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,640
that they were saying.

136
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,120
They had the opportunity

137
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,400
to change hearts and minds.

138
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,560
They had the opportunity

139
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,920
to get bills passed.

140
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,800
They had the opportunity

141
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,200
to get votes for their legislation.

142
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,040
But whatever it was,

143
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,480
I understood

144
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,680
that there was an opportunity here

145
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,560
and there was an opportunity

146
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,480
that I could not be missed.

147
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,640
And if you have that opportunity,

148
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,320
you have that time,

149
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,880
you have the attention of someone

150
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,920
in front of you,

151
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,360
how do you use it to optimize

152
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,520
what you're saying

153
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,640
so that people want to hear you

154
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,760
and activate or go out

155
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,080
and implement what you just said.

156
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,920
And that fascinated me.

157
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,200
That kind of very idea.

158
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,360
It's really human behavior

159
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,120
of how we internalize something

160
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,320
and we decide to go do something

161
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,680
because we read it or we saw it,

162
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,560
or we're actually looking at someone

163
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,240
as a role model

164
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,760
and trying to replicate or emulate them.

165
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,320
And Representative Israel,

166
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,080
Congressman Israel was really,

167
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,480
he saw this in me and I saw

168
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,520
and I was itching to write.

169
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,760
And it was the year

170
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,320
after the second Lebanese war,

171
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,080
and he was putting through a lot of

172
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,760
a legislation in Congress

173
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,680
around the end of the war.

174
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,280
And I asked to write

175
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,960
some of his speeches.

176
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,680
I also input a lot of

177
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,480
what he would be saying

178
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,720
on the floor of the House.

179
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,040
And that's where it kind of started.

180
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,040
From there, I went in to Haaretz.

181
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,960
And I was an editor on the website

182
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,880
for three years.

183
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,600
And then, went to Channel 10

184
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,120
here in Israel,

185
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,360
which is now Channel 13.

186
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,680
Right.

187
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,400
i24 News.

188
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,800
And then, i24 News.

189
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,000
Studied in London.

190
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,720
My goal was always to be in the UN.

191
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,200
I thought I was going to be a diplomat.

192
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,000
I threw that in the trash.

193
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,560
But the storytelling aspect of it all,

194
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,160
I think does actually run deep.

195
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
And there is a real common denominator

196
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,360
between the things that I've done.

197
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,480
So, if I can even say anything

198
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,440
that I learned from that is,

199
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,920
everything will make sense in the end.

200
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,960
If you follow your passion

201
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,720
and continue doing things that you like,

202
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
you don't need to

203
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,240
create your resume in advance.

204
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,400
You actually,

205
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,320
you look back and you'll say,

206
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,240
wow, that's actually

207
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,920
really does make sense.

208
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,000
Yael, the very first thing

209
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,600
that you said was,

210
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,760
storytelling, it's pretty basic

211
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,440
in its roots.

212
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,560
But I have to tell you,

213
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,080
I took a class very recently at Stanford

214
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,040
with David Demarest.

215
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,480
He was a senior staff

216
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,320
for the White House,

217
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,040
for George Bush Senior.

218
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,320
And we had dinner a few times.

219
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,480
And the stories that he told me

220
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
about the responsibility,

221
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,360
he wrote most of the speeches

222
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,440
for George Bush the senior.

223
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,120
And the responsibility and the burden

224
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,920
of being the storyteller

225
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,120
with the nuances,

226
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,400
and you wrote speeches

227
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,280
for heads of state, presidents,

228
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,600
CEOs, right?

229
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,040
And so, it's not just telling,

230
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
taking the content

231
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,880
and putting it in the nice way,

232
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,600
but it's actually the art of delivering

233
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,480
it and convincing others in your message.

234
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,280
And I can only imagine

235
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,000
the responsibility and the anxiousness

236
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,600
of watching them deliver the speech

237
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,680
and seeing the reactions.

238
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,840
Because we can see,

239
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,120
especially in 2020,

240
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,160
with the elections on all sides,

241
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,440
how every speech,

242
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,400
every debate is so fundamentally crucial

243
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,800
to the position of the candidates,

244
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,240
that I can only imagine

245
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,880
the skills that you have to build.

246
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,920
And what's remarkable,

247
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,000
I think about your journey,

248
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,720
that I'm getting a lot

249
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,320
of inspiration from is,

250
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
I see a trend today

251
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,160
that people are moving

252
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,920
very, very quickly between domains

253
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,680
as if it's like a check box.

254
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,160
And while you've moved quite a bit

255
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,320
from different domains,

256
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,080
you've really dug deep into them.

257
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,120
You've spent

258
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,600
five to seven years

259
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,360
in editing and journalism,

260
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,280
and then in speech writing,

261
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,640
and now in the high tech.

262
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,280
Five years spending in

263
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,000
in a hypergrowth startup,

264
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,600
that's incredible.

265
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,040
So, while you did change,

266
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,320
you really dug deep

267
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,800
into all of those subjects.

268
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,440
Do you feel that way?

269
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,560
Yes. And I think I do in retrospect.

270
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,720
I don't claim to have

271
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,280
known all of this ahead of time.

272
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,240
I didn't go out and say,

273
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,640
I'm going to spend five years here.

274
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,240
I mean, had you asked me

275
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,840
six years ago if I thought I'd be working

276
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,840
in an insurance company,

277
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,520
I would have thought

278
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,480
you were absolutely crazy.

279
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,640
That wasn't on my grand scheme of things.

280
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,040
But I can say that

281
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,000
one thing I have learned,

282
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,360
and this is only in retrospect,

283
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,040
so everything,

284
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,360
we're all so smart in retrospect,

285
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,480
is that the focus and kind of,

286
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
when you kind of focus

287
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,360
on one or two skills

288
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,680
that you want to hone on

289
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,880
and understand

290
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,240
and get really good at,

291
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,520
there's only focus.

292
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:39,160
You can't spread yourself too thin.

293
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,760
You have to know

294
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,360
what you're good at

295
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,920
and what you want to get better at.

296
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,280
And I'm a true believer

297
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,680
in getting better at stuff

298
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,280
that you're not great at.

299
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:47,640
But I also think that

300
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,760
when you focus on something

301
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,760
and you don't try to win it all,

302
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,760
you get to interesting results.

303
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,040
So, what are you really good at?

304
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,440
What is your focus?

305
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,600
So, I think, I'm trying to understand

306
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,520
the flexibility

307
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,640
and the dynamics of storytelling

308
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,040
to its core.

309
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,280
As I said, when I was just starting out,

310
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,520
I was absolutely sure

311
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,400
I was going to be a journalist forever.

312
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,080
And then that kind of turned into,

313
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,840
well, journalism is great,

314
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,080
and I think I can give a lot

315
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,160
and learn a lot,

316
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,080
but I don't think it's actually

317
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,640
going to change policy.

318
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,600
And then, I wanted very much to go into

319
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,160
the Foreign Service and be a diplomat.

320
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,960
And I went to school in London

321
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,920
thinking that that would be

322
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,880
my next step before the UN

323
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
or something like that.

324
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,560
And I think, in London,

325
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,880
my understanding there was,

326
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,840
sure you can go into the foreign service,

327
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,200
but actually, as you said,

328
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:49,400
the person really helping

329
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,880
some of the leaders

330
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,200
formulate their policy

331
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,280
are these ghostwriters or speechwriters

332
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,760
or whatever you like to call them.

333
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,280
And so, that fascinated me.

334
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,120
I said it's not only about the words,

335
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,400
it's about who you're working with.

336
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,120
And I was fortunate enough

337
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,640
to work with really top leaders

338
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,760
here in Israel,

339
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,400
writing their speeches in English.

340
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,920
And then that kind of relationship also

341
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,000
really fascinated me, because I said,

342
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,280
wow, if you take that relationship,

343
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,120
you put it to business,

344
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,520
to public companies,

345
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,280
and you work with CEOs

346
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,640
of a public company

347
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,120
and formulating their message,

348
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,080
how are they going to speak

349
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,480
when they have earnings calls

350
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,640
and stuff like that.

351
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,600
That really fascinated me as well.

352
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,360
And I was fortunate to work with

353
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,640
the CEO of Teva Pharmaceuticals

354
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,320
for a while.

355
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,240
And I started adding on clients

356
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,280
in business,

357
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,400
not only in politics,

358
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,680
and understanding that

359
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,840
in terms of the storytelling,

360
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,160
if I go back to what I started with,

361
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
this is fascinating.

362
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,760
This is something that

363
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,600
you keep on learning

364
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,240
and learning and learning.

365
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,840
And if I can focus on that

366
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
and get better

367
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,280
and kind of expand my knowledge

368
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,440
in the storytelling realm

369
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,040
by working with different leaders,

370
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,156
I really will expand

371
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:03,200
my knowledge base in general.

372
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,760
And then, it was pretty clear to me

373
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,120
after a few years doing that,

374
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,920
that technology and Silicon Valley

375
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,880
was where maybe policy

376
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,800
was even trumping a lot

377
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
of the things that are

378
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,880
in government and no pun intended.

379
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,880
That didn't sound very good.

380
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,760
But I did kind of feel like

381
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,960
I wanted to join something

382
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,320
that was bigger than

383
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,560
what I could do by myself.

384
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,680
Wait, Yael, were going to dive into this.

385
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,800
But I have to ask you before that.

386
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,200
Because I needed you to take us

387
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,400
into the mind of the storyteller

388
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,760
for a second, because,

389
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
you know, the majority of the people

390
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,080
listening to this, including myself,

391
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
are young, scrappy,

392
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,120
hungry entrepreneurs that are,

393
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,560
we tell ourselves stories

394
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,800
and we think of the world,

395
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,880
and we keep trying to reinvent things

396
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,320
that are happening around us.

397
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,800
Yet I'd love to learn

398
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,000
a little bit from you.

399
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,200
When you approach a story,

400
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,920
whether it's helping write a speech

401
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,280
for a president or for a CEO,

402
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,520
or for Lemonade,

403
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,360
what are some of the thought process

404
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,600
that goes into building this narrative

405
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,480
that at the end, others want to follow?

406
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,520
And I'm genuinely asking this

407
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,800
because I'm curious to

408
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,200
what constitutes a good story,

409
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,760
a good narrative?

410
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,400
So, I think one of the first things

411
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,280
that you have to think about

412
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,800
when you're writing anything,

413
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,560
and it's who you're writing for.

414
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,320
Who are the audience

415
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,560
and what do you want them to feel,

416
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,160
what do you want them

417
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,960
to take away from it.

418
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,800
Because everyone has,

419
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,680
especially in [--],

420
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,920
like zero attention span.

421
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,720
Right.

422
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,320
People are on the go.

423
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,640
They're getting their information

424
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,200
in 10 different ways

425
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,480
that you didn't even optimize for.

426
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,920
So, when you're trying to write something

427
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,160
you really need to narrow down.

428
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,640
It goes back to the focus.

429
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,840
Focus on who exactly

430
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,760
you want to be reading this,

431
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,960
and what they want to be feeling

432
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,640
or what you want them to be feeling.

433
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,880
And when you have that in mind,

434
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,800
you can kind of create that story

435
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
in a way that makes sense,

436
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,440
not for you.

437
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,480
A lot of times we're writing

438
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
and we think this is my story.

439
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,760
Sure, it may be your story,

440
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,080
but if you want people to go

441
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,440
and execute on that story,

442
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,520
or buy your product,

443
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,560
or believe in you and vote for you,

444
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,880
or whatever it is

445
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,120
that you want them to do,

446
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,680
you really have to think about them

447
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,360
and what they're feeling.

448
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,240
And kind of create that story

449
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
for them and not for you.

450
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,760
And I think, that's a lot,

451
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,560
it's kind of counterintuitive.

452
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,280
Because you open up your Google Docs

453
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,240
and you start typing

454
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,360
and you feel like you're

455
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,440
sharing who you are.

456
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,800
But it's actually not really about you.

457
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,480
It's about your any customer.

458
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,920
Whether that be constituents

459
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,960
and or your customer

460
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,160
or your parents or whatever it is.

461
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,000
Who is this audience.

462
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And then the second thing

463
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,320
that I would say is that,

464
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,240
because we have such a short

465
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,000
attention span,

466
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,840
you need content,

467
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,800
you need stories or data points

468
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,480
or whatever it is

469
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,800
that you're constructing

470
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,440
that sticks.

471
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,760
Sticky content, they call it.

472
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,840
And it's something that

473
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,960
people will walk away,

474
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,240
if they can remember one thing

475
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,080
from what you just wrote

476
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
or what you just said,

477
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,160
or the infographic that you made,

478
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,560
what will that be?

479
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,120
And sometimes you need to shock them.

480
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,560
Sometimes it needs to be something

481
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,320
that is actually inspiring

482
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,680
and not just fluffy content,

483
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,640
which a lot of people like:

484
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,080
Oh, I read a nice quote somewhere,

485
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,040
let me put it in.

486
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,840
But nobody really remembers it.

487
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,040
Like, what is a sticky part

488
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,960
of your content

489
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
that you're going to be

490
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,680
leaving the audience with?

491
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,280
I guess, that would be mine to [--].

492
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,200
So, how do you know that?

493
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,480
So, when I'm sitting down

494
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,160
and I'm preparing a talk,

495
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,960
or I'm preparing a letter,

496
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,400
how do I know

497
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,960
if something is going to stick?

498
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,120
Do you test it out before?

499
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,400
Do you get feedback from others?

500
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,840
And how do you run

501
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,040
all those experiments?

502
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,240
Because that sounds complicated.

503
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,040
It is.

504
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,680
It's a lot of trial and error.

505
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,240
And it's a lot

506
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,480
of getting to know your audience.

507
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,960
So, sometimes you'll write something

508
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,480
and it will fall flat.

509
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,840
So, sometimes people will like that.

510
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,520
They'll say, "Okay, I wrote something."

511
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
People read it,

512
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,360
but it didn't do anything.

513
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,800
And sometimes that's like comforting

514
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,160
because okay, it didn't move the needle,

515
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,680
but at least it didn't get anyone angry.

516
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,680
On the other hand, if you take more risks

517
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
and you go out on a limb and you say,

518
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,040
"I'm not going to speak to everyone."

519
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,800
"I'm going to speak to

520
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,040
2% of my audience.

521
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,000
Because I know that those 2%

522
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,320
are the most engaged

523
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,440
and they will follow me

524
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,160
and they'll come after me

525
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,960
if I ask them to.

526
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,480
You see that a lot in politics.

527
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,160
It's not only--

528
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
I was just about to say,

529
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,080
I mean, we're watching it unfold live

530
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,320
to these different tactics. Right.

531
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,240
And so, you can't win everyone.

532
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,040
And you can't win

533
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,560
the hearts and minds of everyone.

534
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,160
But if you go when you say something

535
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,280
that will make someone's ears perk up

536
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,360
and another person's another person's,

537
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,480
you're probably going to get

538
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,120
a more engaged audience,

539
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,680
than if you say kind of the clichés

540
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,080
that everyone's used to.

541
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,840
And so, that's it.

542
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840
You have to be a risk taker.

543
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,240
It's a lot a lot of risk.

544
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,000
And be prepared to kind of own

545
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,320
what you're saying.

546
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,600
So, when you sit down

547
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,680
and listen to a speech,

548
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,800
when you watch the news

549
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,120
or when you're listening

550
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,000
to somebody talk,

551
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,080
do you cringe sometimes?

552
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,840
Like do you have like,

553
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,160
wheels in motion saying like:

554
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,040
oh, this is the tactic

555
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,720
that they're using,

556
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,360
they're alluding to something bigger.,

557
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,160
they're trying to get me

558
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,280
to feel these emotions.

559
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,920
Do you have that process?

560
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
Yeah. Sometimes.

561
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,840
I try to take it off

562
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
because you don't want

563
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,960
to become too cynical.

564
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,760
You want to believe

565
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,720
that there is you know,

566
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
the cynicism will at the end

567
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,480
really make us

568
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,960
not optimistic to be.

569
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,480
So. I want to keep the hope alive.

570
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,800
I want to think that,

571
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,560
that there are people

572
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,800
that are speaking genuinely

573
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,720
and they're not trying to

574
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,840
artificially implant

575
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,520
all kinds of speaking tactics

576
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,160
and rhetoric and stuff like that.

577
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,760
And I do believe

578
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,240
that there are people out there

579
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,520
that are speaking from their,

580
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,680
their heart and their brain

581
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,920
and not trying to rouse up the crowds.

582
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,520
But, yes. You can't ignore it.

583
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,480
Once you see it,

584
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,360
it's like you can't unsee it.

585
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,120
I love it.

586
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,760
Yael,

587
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,680
so Vice President of communications

588
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,240
at Lemonade, hypergrowth startup.

589
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,160
You're joining very

590
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,040
from the early days.

591
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,680
And that's a fascinating thing.

592
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,080
Because you're coming in

593
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,240
from the political world

594
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,960
right into high tech.

595
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,000
What is that experience like

596
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,320
and what

597
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,800
was the journey like

598
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,200
reinventing the messaging

599
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,360
behind insurance?

600
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,760
So, as I said from the start,

601
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,960
I really am privileged

602
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,800
to be able to work

603
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,360
with two of the finest entrepreneurs

604
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,720
that I can think of today.

605
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,040
Daniel Schreiber and Shai Wininger.

606
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,440
They were tech veterans.

607
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,320
And they had been around,

608
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,080
been around the tech scene, so to speak.

609
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,920
And when they stopped at insurance,

610
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,360
they found an opportunity that really was

611
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,200
this huge opportunity

612
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,640
because it was so unchanged.

613
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,320
We have gone through decades,

614
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,280
if not centuries of

615
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,080
stagnation.

616
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,960
It was so unloved when they came.

617
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,440
And when I heard about insurance

618
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,960
for the first time through Lemonade,

619
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,520
I said, that sounds like, I don't know,

620
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,240
it can't be something compelling.

621
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,080
But that actually,

622
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,240
the fact that it was unchanged

623
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,160
and unloved was

624
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,560
a huge market opportunity

625
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,600
and a huge storytelling opportunity.

626
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,200
Because suddenly,

627
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,680
you can change the perception

628
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,400
of something that is really

629
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,560
such a fundamental part of society.

630
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:43,800
Right?

631
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
And when something goes wrong,

632
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,400
you want to make sure

633
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,240
that you have something to cover you.

634
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,800
And why did it lose its way?

635
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,560
What happened to that story of insurance

636
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,320
that started really

637
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,080
as communities coming together

638
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,320
and really lost its way

639
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,960
through the kind of evolution of society?

640
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,280
Kind of really ignored

641
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,800
every other revolution

642
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,600
that went through.

643
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,400
Insurance stayed the same.

644
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,800
And I think, that part of the story

645
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,840
of taking on an industry

646
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,880
that was so vast

647
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,520
but also so unloved,

648
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,240
is like a storyteller's dream.

649
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,240
It's an entrepreneur dream.

650
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,040
It's a product dream.

651
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,760
You can see it through any lens

652
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,040
that you like,

653
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
but really,

654
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,960
understanding the opportunity here,

655
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,560
both to work with Daniel Shai

656
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,600
and the rest of the team,

657
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,440
and also understanding the opportunity

658
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,240
at hand for the world,

659
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,960
a Lemonade is also a big corporation,

660
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,120
so understanding that we're

661
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,200
a for profit business,

662
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,640
but we have like social good

663
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,840
embedded in our business model

664
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,320
was something that

665
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,720
I want it to be part of that story.

666
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,360
I wanted to tell that story.

667
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,720
And as I said,

668
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,240
joining something that is bigger

669
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,320
than the sum of yourself

670
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,480
is it's really gratifying in the end

671
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:53,960
if it works.

672
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,240
And if even if it doesn't work,

673
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,400
it's great.

674
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,200
And all of a sudden, it's almost like

675
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,240
the ultimate challenge for a storyteller.

676
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,840
Because you're literally

677
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,440
trying to change the perception

678
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,680
of what it means to be insurance.

679
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,040
Because just like yourself,

680
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,160
I think the majority of the people,

681
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,800
they think of insurance until today

682
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
and they think of like:

683
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,280
okay, this is the enemy,

684
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,720
they're trying to take my money,

685
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,320
and maybe if I have an accident,

686
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,040
I can finally get the money back

687
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,800
from them. Right?

688
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,520
It's almost like a win

689
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,600
in front of your insurance company.

690
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,000
All of a sudden,

691
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,280
here you're trying to work on a startup

692
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,720
that is trying to create

693
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,080
a social contract with insurance.

694
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,640
What was the biggest challenge there

695
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,400
with sort of

696
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,800
trying to reinvent that messaging?

697
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,280
So, it's everything that you said.

698
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,120
Like, how do we make

699
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,480
insurance interesting

700
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,440
for people that never really,

701
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,080
either life insurance,

702
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,560
or in our case especially,

703
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,600
people that never had insurance before.

704
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,840
A lot of our customers

705
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,240
are first time insurance buyers.

706
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,360
Meaning, they never, ever had insurance.

707
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,400
What will make them

708
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,280
want to come to Lemonade?

709
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,560
And we've talk about Lemonade

710
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,640
in general, an insurance.

711
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,440
I think, Hippo, does also.

712
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,320
Similar messaging is understanding that

713
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,880
insurance can be lovable.

714
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,880
It can be spoken about in a way

715
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,160
that nobody ever dared

716
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,240
to speak about it before.

717
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,600
And when we launched in New York

718
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,640
in September 2016,

719
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,600
we started seeing people

720
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,640
tweet about their Lemonade experience

721
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,720
being delightful and amused.

722
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,840
And is it weird that I

723
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,160
love my insurance company?

724
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,920
And it started

725
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,320
ringing also back to us saying,

726
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,960
you know, we're on to something.

727
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,640
And if we make an experience

728
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,400
that is absolutely delightful

729
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,880
from start to finish,

730
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,240
that is seamless and fun

731
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,840
and brings smiles to people's faces,

732
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,040
and they can choose a charity

733
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,440
that they like to support,

734
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,680
then we're really kind of changing

735
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,960
the entire fundamentals of insurance.

736
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,120
Not just the financials,

737
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,040
but really how people interact with it.

738
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,640
And that's kind of the ultimate story.

739
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,400
And obviously, I think from the start

740
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,600
and I've been following the journey

741
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,280
for a long time,

742
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,440
there's so many different facets

743
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
that you've employed

744
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,040
in order to change that narrative.

745
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,120
Starting from the transparency

746
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,400
of being fully transparent from day zero.

747
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,160
And when you think of insurance,

748
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,480
you think of this like big monster

749
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,800
that's like getting all the cash.

750
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,240
And all of a sudden,

751
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,080
you're being transparent

752
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,960
about the financials

753
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,160
and about the intentions.

754
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,520
And I think that

755
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,840
I gained a lot of inspiration.

756
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,800
And I'm delighted to be now

757
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,040
with a self-funded hippo,

758
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,080
and seeing also

759
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,560
how the different companies,

760
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,880
somehow all of them are Israelis,

761
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,240
but also next to insurance,

762
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,440
they're coming in and all of a sudden,

763
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,480
such a big field

764
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,240
is changing so dramatically.

765
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,040
And at the end,

766
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,840
it's for the benefit of a lot of people.

767
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,480
It's for the benefit

768
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,160
of millions of people.

769
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,840
But unfortunately,

770
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,240
I can't believe 20 minutes are almost up.

771
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,080
I have about a hundred

772
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,640
different questions

773
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,840
that I wanted to ask here.

774
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,320
Yale, I want to thank you so much

775
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,720
for being on the show.

776
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,520
I really appreciate it.

777
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,080
Back from when

778
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,440
you very generously donated

779
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,680
your time to come

780
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,440
to one of my debate programs

781
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,680
or debate public school

782
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,600
to teach us about storytelling.

783
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,480
And that was

784
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,240
one of the most inspiring sessions

785
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,200
that we had and I've been,

786
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,520
I was in that club for about five years.

787
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,400
So, thank you,

788
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,800
going all the way back there.

789
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,240
And before we leave,

790
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,920
I have to ask you for three words

791
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,640
that you would use to describe yourself.

792
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,960
Oh, you ask tough questions.

793
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
The hardest one.

794
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,240
Yeah, it is.

795
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,560
I don't want to self described.

796
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,760
But I can tell you the three things

797
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,240
that I kind of really admire

798
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,760
and I hope that I use in my,

799
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,840
when I'm with my teams.

800
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,440
And they know this.

801
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,560
And so I'm happy to kind of

802
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,640
spread it around.

803
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,680
But the three things that I really admire

804
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,920
in a person and a leader are

805
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,400
resilience,

806
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,440
integrity,

807
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,360
and compassion.

808
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,480
And I think that the,

809
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,800
the three of them together

810
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,520
really kind of

811
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,320
touch upon different aspects

812
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
of leadership,

813
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,880
but also of human behavior

814
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,920
that is crucial.

815
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,480
Especially in 2020.

816
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,640
Yael, toda raba.

817
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,400
Thank you so much.

818
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,840
I can't wait to share

819
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,920
this with the world.

820
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,720
And best of luck

821
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,360
with everything that you're doing.

822
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:53,920
Thank you.
