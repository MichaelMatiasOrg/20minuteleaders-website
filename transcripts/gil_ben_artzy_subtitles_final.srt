1
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,532
All right. Gil Ben Artzy,

2
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:57,199
thank you for joining me

3
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,199
on 20 Minute Leaders.

4
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,332
Absolutely.

5
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,432
Thank you so much for having me.

6
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:02,066
You already told me you're gonna cheat

7
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:02,932
on the last question.

8
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:03,666
So, I'm so excited

9
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:04,832
for this interview because

10
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,532
it's gonna be I think different

11
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,266
from all the rest.

12
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,399
Gil, we know each other for many

13
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,266
many years now.

14
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:13,332
Ever since I think I came to visit you in Palo Alto

15
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:17,099
like six years ago for Anymeal,

16
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,532
the diet startup.

17
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:22,966
Gil, give me two, three sentences

18
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:23,866
about Upwest

19
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,199
and what you guys do.

20
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,266
I had an episode with Shuly but

21
00:06:28,267 --> 00:06:29,266
it's so amazing that we have

22
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:30,132
to talk about it again.

23
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:30,966
There you go.

24
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,366
So, you can compare notes

25
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:33,799
and see if we're doing a good job.

26
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,099
I want to see if you're consistant

27
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,299
There you go.

28
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,766
So, Upwest is an early stage seed fund.

29
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,766
We actually invest in both pre-seed

30
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:42,599
and seed stage.

31
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,499
And we are tailor-made

32
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,666
for Israeli founders

33
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,232
that are looking to break

34
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:50,166
into the US market.

35
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:52,299
So, we are focused on investing

36
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,099
in Israeli founders

37
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,099
and helping them in the early stages

38
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,166
of ramping up the team,

39
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:57,999
getting momentum,

40
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,399
fund raising and so forth, here in the US.

41
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,932
We've done it for close to nine years now.

42
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:05,266
We've backed over 80 companies

43
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:05,732
that raised

44
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:08,566
over, well over, one billion dollars

45
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:09,732
in follow and financing.

46
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:12,832
First investor in ... which is

47
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,332
a Unitcon startup and many other

48
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,399
prominent companies that

49
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,799
we think at least

50
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,932
a few will reach that stage.

51
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:21,332
So, we've been super excited to do this

52
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,966
for a while now. And yeah, I'm looking for

53
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:24,666
the future ahead.

54
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:26,199
Amazing. So, I always joked

55
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,799
with new funds

56
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,532
that when you start out, the lifetime

57
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,799
of a company is like, what, seven to nine years

58
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,299
That's the game you're going in to.

59
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,732
So, usually the first few years it can kind of go

60
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:38,466
along without showing

61
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:39,499
too many returns

62
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,132
because it takes seven to nine years.

63
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:42,666
But you're there. So, now you have to

64
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,166
show returns and obviously

65
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:44,766
you've showing

66
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:46,099
some pretty amazing returns

67
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,766
or you've shown amazing companies

68
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,366
and where they're at now.

69
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:53,432
What is this idea of Israelis

70
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:55,032
in Silicon Valley

71
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,599
and this integration and adaptation?

72
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,632
So, first of all, eight, nine years in VC

73
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:04,766
is very very young.

74
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:06,599
I'm still learning every day.

75
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,132
It's the equivalent of maybe eight,

76
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:08,666
nine months

77
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:09,866
in the startups.

78
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:11,332
So, we've been around for a while

79
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,366
but it takes

80
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:16,466
time, decades. You know, I think Israel

81
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:18,666
always had a very special relationship

82
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:19,432
with the US.

83
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,366
But on the tech funds, specifically with

84
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,299
the valley, you've seen over the years

85
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,332
fantastic companies emerge here.

86
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,799
And in the last couple of decades

87
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,399
in particular,

88
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,932
many fantastic companies, such as House

89
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:35,299
and others have emerged here by really

90
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,932
incredible Israeli founders.

91
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,899
And our goal is to level the playing fields

92
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,232
for Israeli companies

93
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:41,499
that wanna come here

94
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,699
and get the same opportunities that

95
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,532
other founders that are

96
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:45,532
already based here.

97
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,866
Amazing. Gil, how many companies,

98
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:49,966
how many decks do you read a year?

99
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:56,432
We see well over a thousand. We invest in

100
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:59,732
far less than one percent.

101
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:02,966
And what, the way

102
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:04,499
we think about it is not about

103
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,366
screening them and stuff.

104
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:07,799
I mean, we spend a lot of time

105
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,666
in Israel and

106
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,732
here and whether its Zoom or in person,

107
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:12,499
our goal is really also to give feedback.

108
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,599
Like we wanna contribute to their journey.

109
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,466
Give them some insights

110
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:17,466
about the market.

111
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:19,866
Maybe a few competitors that maybe

112
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:22,599
had not heard about or know, you know

113
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,566
or we can add more information about.

114
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:27,532
So, we really wanna help them and advise them

115
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:31,599
because they deserve it.

116
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,066
Incredible. I don’t know many people

117
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:34,866
who can talk about their job and say that

118
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,966
after nine years of being in the same

119
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,299
quote unquote job

120
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,099
they're still learning every day

121
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,532
and it feels like

122
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:42,399
they were only there for

123
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,099
eight or nine months.

124
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,099
So, already I'm inspired by this passion.

125
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,599
Gil, where do you come from?

126
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,466
You have a pretty interesting leeway.

127
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:52,832
Yeah. So, Israeli you're talking right.

128
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:57,332
My first nine years I, I was actually born

129
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,499
in Be'er Sheva. When my parents were

130
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,732
in their very early 20s and going to university.

131
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:06,566
So, I was born in Be'er Sheva but

132
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,866
I grow up my first nine years in Kfar Saba.

133
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:10,799
We then moved to London.

134
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,466
I spend seven years growing up

135
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:13,066
in London.

136
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:14,866
I can feel it in the accent.

137
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:17,632
The accent and definitely my passion for

138
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:21,499
specific music and sports emerged there.

139
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,966
What is that passion? What is that music?

140
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:26,566
Well, growing up in London

141
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:27,966
in the 80s, right.

142
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,899
You get attached to certain types of music

143
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,599
and take it with you.

144
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,466
But yeah. I'm definitely, like discovering

145
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:40,832
new music on a numbering basis.

146
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,099
I think that's where it began.

147
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,199
Came back to Israel sixteen.

148
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,166
Back to Kfar Saba. Did my military service.

149
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:51,532
Wasn’t smart enough to be in 8200

150
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:52,899
and so forth. I'm the oldest

151
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,766
of three siblings, so I'm

152
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:54,799
the alpha version.

153
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,999
The alpha version is ...

154
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,232
So, my brother and sister did much better

155
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:00,832
than me at school.

156
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:04,432
But I spend three years in the armed corps,

157
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:07,832
did my undergrad, and at the age of 25,

158
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,566
I decided that I want to break into

159
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,566
the US market on my own. Right?

160
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:17,232
No real tech background but I did wanna

161
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,166
know that I wanted to spend

162
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:18,799
some time here.

163
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,966
And moved here to do

164
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:21,799
my MBA at Wharton.

165
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,199
Worked for BCG in New York

166
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,832
and then Yahoo and here we are.

167
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,599
Amazing. And what did you do at Yahoo?

168
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,832
I started off in the

169
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:30,599
Corporate Development team

170
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,866
which was amazing exposure. Got to work

171
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:37,032
with fantastic people and even

172
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:38,166
the founders of Yahoo.

173
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:41,532
Being Israeli, I send myself

174
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,866
to Israel once or

175
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:45,266
twice a year. To see startups. Help them.

176
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:49,399
But also ended up acquiring Yahoo's

177
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,266
first company in Israel. Helping to open

178
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:52,999
the first R&D center in Haifa.

179
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,032
And it's actually where the seeding of sort

180
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:58,166
of Upwest began when

181
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,732
I met Shuly in 2006

182
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,199
and we start ...

183
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,599
start differences between some of

184
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,632
the founders here and some of

185
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:07,599
the founders in Israel that were at least

186
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,566
on the same level in terms of their DNA

187
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:12,499
but maybe didn’t have

188
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,499
the same opportunities

189
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,166
of those that were

190
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,532
already based in the US.

191
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,299
Incredible. I mean I was just such

192
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,766
a small kid.

193
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:19,266
You're saying Yahoo.

194
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:21,299
That was about 2005, 2006?

195
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,966
Started in '05

196
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:24,132
spent 4 years in CopDev and

197
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:25,399
2 years in operations. Yes.

198
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,932
At that time I had my Yahoo mailbox

199
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:29,332
and all my friends had a Yahoo mailbox.

200
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,066
It was obviously a different time back then

201
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:33,766
in terms of the market share of the companies.

202
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:35,699
But that's incredible. And Gil,

203
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,999
you have the unique experience

204
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,699
of being a partner in quite a few

205
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,966
portfolio companies. How many

206
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:43,566
portfolio companies

207
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:44,799
do you see through now?

208
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,066
Over the past nine years?

209
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,799
How many have we invested or seen?

210
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,899
Right yeah invested in. That you're a part of their journey.

211
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,799
Invested in, 82.

212
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,866
82. Okay.

213
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:56,699
So, you have the unique privilege

214
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,599
and the challenging role

215
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,732
to come in to this incredibly difficult time

216
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:03,632
over the past three months and

217
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:06,932
you have to help 82 companies or

218
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:08,932
a little less go through this journey of

219
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:09,832
dealing with Covid-19

220
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,099
and you actually have to do it also

221
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,566
with a newborn. Congratulations.

222
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:13,266
Thank you.

223
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,732
Beautiful Maya. What is that like?

224
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:19,399
What is your role as the VC partner and

225
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,499
helping these portfolio companies

226
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:21,899
push through this?

227
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,632
So, first of all it's not individual support,

228
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:25,999
right.

229
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,799
I mean it's myself, my partners,

230
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,832
but also the other well investors

231
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,099
that back the companies.

232
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:37,099
And I think for us it's giving a sanity check

233
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,799
to the founders and also helping spread

234
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,066
information what others are doing.

235
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:44,266
So, for example in the very beginning,

236
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:46,499
it's really encouraging them to take a

237
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,366
close look at their runway and not be shy

238
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:52,066
in making decisions,

239
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:54,732
some of them tough, about their workforce

240
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,699
because the longer you procrastinate

241
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,366
and say,

242
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:59,466
"You know, we'll have to wait."

243
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:01,232
the more painful it become afterwards.

244
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:07,166
So, it’s having those eyes wide

245
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:08,266
open conversation.

246
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:11,766
Did you have a situation

247
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:12,832
where you pushed

248
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,099
a founder to make that difficult decision

249
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,899
and you feel like if you weren't in the picture

250
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,199
they might not have been able to make it?

251
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,332
Yeah, I wouldn’t say pushed them.

252
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,332
I think maybe pushed them to think about

253
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,399
other alternatives.

254
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,232
And sometimes it’s not just about us.

255
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,766
It's about connecting them

256
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,099
maybe to other founders.

257
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,299
We also brought people

258
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,732
that were, back in 2008

259
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:36,666
so the previous recession,

260
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,299
and had to overcome that.

261
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,366
So, it's not just about what I know,

262
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:40,832
what I think.

263
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,932
It's about sort of being sort of

264
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:45,699
their advisor and shepherding them

265
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,732
through the process.

266
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:50,766
And do you approach this optimistically,

267
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:54,266
pessimistically, or realistically? What's your

268
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:56,566
position at the dinner table with your

269
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:57,166
founding team?

270
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:58,966
You know there's no pessimist

271
00:14:58,967 --> 00:14:59,399
in the world

272
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,432
there's only optimist and realist. Right?

273
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:11,099
I think as a venture capitalist, as a founder

274
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,799
you have to have some heavy dose

275
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,932
of optimism. Right? It makes no sense to

276
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:18,899
start a company and try to battle these

277
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,932
incredible giants or overcome of

278
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:21,899
the obstacle.

279
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,566
So, you need to have this

280
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:24,566
level of optimism.

281
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:27,432
So, we do go into it. But at the same time

282
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:30,032
you need to plan for the worst

283
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:31,332
and the worst is

284
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,299
you need to have 18, 24 months of

285
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,632
runway for example.

286
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:38,699
And not just say, "You know, this will be a

287
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,866
V-shaped recovery and in three months

288
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:41,866
everything will be fine."

289
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:43,932
You know what? Let's all hope so

290
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:46,032
that’s the case but let's plan for it

291
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:48,266
not being whatsoever that.

292
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:50,799
Amazing. Gil, what excites you?

293
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,499
After nine years, thousands

294
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,032
of potential deals,

295
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:56,999
82 investments.

296
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,666
What gets you up in the morning?

297
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,366
What are you really really excited about?

298
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:07,699
Lots of things. I don't think I'm one of

299
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,566
those investors that says,

300
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,299
"This domain or that domain."

301
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,199
I think for me it really comes to the people

302
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,599
that we meet at a coffee shop,

303
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,032
on the corner of Rothschild Avenue

304
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:20,032
and something in Tel Aviv.

305
00:16:20,033 --> 00:16:23,232
When they only have the gleam in their eyes

306
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:27,366
and they just started and it's about trying

307
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:29,899
to see if sort of we can help guide them through

308
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,432
come to the US and growing their business

309
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:35,832
to become what we think it can become.

310
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,432
So, I think it's that optimism, that belief,

311
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:40,599
those early days, the process,

312
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,466
the ups, the downs.

313
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:44,932
I think the journey itself

314
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:45,866
is what excites me.

315
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:47,799
Certainly new technologies

316
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,066
impact on the world

317
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:53,332
I am completely on board. But it's I think

318
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,932
being part of the journey of one person

319
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,499
against the world, quote unquote

320
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,199
that I like being part of.

321
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,132
And how would you describe your

322
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:04,332
engagement with them?

323
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,832
Some VCs are very hands-off,

324
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,199
take my money and leave.

325
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,132
Sort of dumb money.

326
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:11,666
Some of them are, come sit in our offices

327
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:12,899
giving a small ...

328
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,966
but how do you approach

329
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,766
this relationship of yours with your

330
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:17,499
portfolio companies

331
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,899
at such an early stage?

332
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,999
Yeah. Look, I think each investor

333
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,532
wants to contribute. I think each investor

334
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:27,332
plays a different role.

335
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,232
So, at the very beginning

336
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,699
we are almost always

337
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,499
the first and only money in the company.

338
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,332
So, it's about typically guiding them in the

339
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:36,966
right direction.

340
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:38,866
Avoiding making big mistakes.

341
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:41,232
Helping them make some decision that

342
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:43,099
early on. Helping them to find additional

343
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,166
investor that can invest.

344
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:46,932
And overtime that evolves because now

345
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,232
they have different advisors that bring

346
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:51,166
something else to the table.

347
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:53,532
So, for us we have to ask ourselves "Okay,

348
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:54,632
how do we change

349
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:56,166
our position and advice

350
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,266
to compliment

351
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:59,332
some of the other people that are

352
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,266
supporting the CEO and the founders?"

353
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:04,032
So, even our role changes over time.

354
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:06,132
No totally, but at the end also,

355
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:08,299
I got to be in the

356
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,032
Upwest offices quite a few times

357
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:10,599
at this point.

358
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,566
It's practically my second home outside

359
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:13,532
of the Stanford dorms.

360
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:16,132
You walk in and you see five, six

361
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:18,099
different companies sitting in their tables

362
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,266
talking to each other. All friends.

363
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:21,766
Everybody's so nice. It's kind of like a hub.

364
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,532
It reminds me of the Google campus

365
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:26,832
that was back in Electra Building

366
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:27,666
you know

367
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:28,866
a few years ago where you walk in

368
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:30,299
and there's this electricity and fire.

369
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,799
And it doesn’t look like it’s a VC office.

370
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,332
It looks like it’s a workspace where

371
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,066
you're not just giving money

372
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40,099
to the portfolio companies.

373
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,632
You're actually giving mentorship and friendship.

374
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:44,632
And a community for them to work together

375
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:46,032
in the heart of Silicon Valley

376
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:48,499
which is not, away from Tel Aviv

377
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,732
where they get to be with other Israelis

378
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:51,266
right in the same room.

379
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:53,199
Yeah. Two things about it.

380
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,266
You're completely right.

381
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,432
First of all the community.

382
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:56,732
Critical word for us.

383
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:59,132
It's about founders going, share

384
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,866
their experiences that actually are

385
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:02,066
pretty unique to them

386
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:02,832
when you think about it.

387
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,132
You move to the US. You come with you're

388
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:06,566
significant other with kids. Many of them.

389
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:11,499
That's not easy whatsoever.

390
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,966
So, you share the experiences,

391
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:15,466
both companies at the same stage

392
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:16,566
but also those that came

393
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:18,132
one, two, five years

394
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:18,632
ahead of you.

395
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:20,199
So, we make sure

396
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,566
to bring all that to the table.

397
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:24,466
But the second thing is, we absolutely

398
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,366
make sure that folks are not sort of

399
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:27,466
sitting within themselves.

400
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,699
It's about pushing them out immersing

401
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,499
in the ecosystem. Just because the culture

402
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,166
of the business here can be

403
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:35,799
at first challenging

404
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,632
and not that straightforward to understand.

405
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:40,732
I'm still figuring it out. Right?

406
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:43,799
So, almost a couple of decades onwards.

407
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,932
So, it's about definitely being out there.

408
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:49,699
It's very easy to get in to your shell and be

409
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,399
with your own folks

410
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,566
but you absolutely have

411
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:52,966
to be out there to succeed.

412
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:54,566
Definitely.

413
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:56,832
Are things changing in the VC world?

414
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,232
What's happening?

415
00:19:58,233 --> 00:20:00,266
Are things have been the same

416
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,132
over the past few decades?

417
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,132
Where do you see things going forward

418
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:05,299
not just with Upwest but general

419
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,499
venture capital relationship with entrepreneurs

420
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,032
let's say in the next decade?

421
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:13,432
Yeah. I don’t know if I'm smart enough

422
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:15,366
to sort of see the next decade,

423
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:16,599
but there's definitely

424
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,799
in the last 10 years plus

425
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,299
have been some definite big changes.

426
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,966
I think the definition of venture capital

427
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:26,366
has changed what VCs bring to the table.

428
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:29,832
Many firms have taken that to add

429
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:33,299
lots of experiences and value adds

430
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,332
in various ways

431
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:38,366
so it's not just the partners in the fund.

432
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,166
Funds of all sizes. Right?

433
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:41,732
In the past seed funds,

434
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:44,299
What is a seed fund? Anything below 50

435
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,632
100 didn’t make any sense.

436
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:47,332
Now you have super ...

437
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,099
seed funds.

438
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,366
That happened a decade ago.

439
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:53,932
So, began at least really fantastic funds there.

440
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:55,899
Obviously the soft bank phenomena

441
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,732
and funds not raising 300 but 3 billion

442
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,232
and even 100 billion as we saw.

443
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:03,299
So, things have changed a lot.

444
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,466
But the covid hasn’t evolved

445
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:08,499
which is trying to get conviction

446
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,232
about a team hoping that they get

447
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:13,299
conviction about you

448
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,666
because you are about to spend seven

449
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:17,399
to 10 years working together.
Hopefully.

450
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,532
So, you want this mutual respect - exactly

451
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:22,699
hopefully - mutual respect, mutual ability

452
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,999
to work together. So, finding those

453
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,399
partnerships founders is not easy.

454
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,166
It actually shouldn’t be easy.

455
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:33,532
It's a big decision for both sides.

456
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:35,699
That hasn’t changed.

457
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,666
Right. Gil, now I'm talking as the young entrepreneur.

458
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,999
I get to surround myself with incredible

459
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,799
other young entrepreneurs

460
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,632
much smarter than me

461
00:21:44,633 --> 00:21:46,732
both from 8200 and Stanford.

462
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:49,099
I'm just amazed by the things

463
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,066
that some of them are doing.

464
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:51,999
And it's very confusing.

465
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,799
There's a lot of options.

466
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,232
A lot of places to go.

467
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:58,499
How does a young entrepreneur

468
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,699
balance their journey? On one hand

469
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,599
there's this pride and I'm gonna go

470
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,899
raise money and I'm gonna finish

471
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,566
my culminator and raise the biggest

472
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:09,366
seed round I can raise.

473
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:10,632
The other hand you have the

474
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:11,999
more conservative approach of,

475
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,466
I'm not sure that I need money.

476
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,032
I can maybe bootstrap this or maybe

477
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:17,766
I'm looking for specific strategic investors.

478
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:19,232
So, how does a young entrepreneur

479
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:20,266
like myself navigate

480
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:21,466
through all these options

481
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:23,232
and what's the most important thing

482
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:24,966
to keep in mind as I'm building my team,

483
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:27,366
as I'm building my strategy to eventually

484
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:28,266
make a big impact?

485
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:30,732
Good question. So, first of all

486
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:31,999
there's no one way. Right?

487
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,499
There’s no one way that treats everything.

488
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,966
For young founders, I think it's about

489
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:38,766
surrounding yourself with the right

490
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:41,899
set of advisors, of friends, and experiences

491
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,999
that you gather along the way

492
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,732
and see what works for you.

493
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:48,532
Sometimes it's about getting you're

494
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,099
knowledgeable about business

495
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,366
that you're super passionate about

496
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:53,132
and you can make it into a bootstrap

497
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:55,032
and you can work with it before fundraising

498
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:56,099
if at all.

499
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,366
Sometimes you have maybe some

500
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:01,632
technical skills, a unique team that you

501
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:03,732
put together that you really have to raise

502
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,832
a meaningful seed to show something

503
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,899
meaningful at the early stage.

504
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,099
So, there's no one answer. But I think

505
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,399
I would encourage everyone to, especially

506
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,399
in Stanford, make those internships

507
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,666
count during the years,

508
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:20,999
during the summer.

509
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,632
Make them as diverse as human impossible.

510
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:26,499
Reach out to people. Have coffee chat,

511
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,466
coffee chats.

512
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:31,699
I actually, I think as my journey

513
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,299
took me here,

514
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,832
I spoke to many dozens

515
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,032
of venture capitalists

516
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:41,366
before even knowing what that is

517
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:43,766
and deciding to jump into the deep end.

518
00:23:43,767 --> 00:23:48,266
And this is 10 years post MBA. So, I took

519
00:23:48,267 --> 00:23:50,066
full advantage of my person network,

520
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:52,232
my business profession networks,

521
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:53,032
to just talk to people

522
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:55,399
and see what they say and what

523
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,799
they've learned and their experiences.

524
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,866
And then figure out the right path for me.

525
00:23:58,867 --> 00:24:01,632
And the right path for me was not

526
00:24:01,633 --> 00:24:02,799
to join a big VC,

527
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,066
but we had the opportunity

528
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:07,732
to start our own, Shuly and me, and bootstrap

529
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:08,632
it if you can believe it

530
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:09,599
at the very beginning.

531
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,066
So, that was the answer for us.

532
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:13,366
Does that mean that's the answer

533
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:15,966
for everyone in our profession? No.

534
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:17,199
Sure. Yeah no

535
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,932
It seems like there is a growing trend

536
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:21,932
where relationships are not so much

537
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:23,699
about the long term

538
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,366
but its more about

539
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:25,799
what can you offer me today

540
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,666
so that and I can offer you something tomorrow

541
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:30,966
which is kind of disheartening and you see it with a

542
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:31,666
competitive nature, I think.

543
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,532
Sometimes at a place like Stanford

544
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:34,332
there’s a lot others

545
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,166
who are very interested in

546
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:37,499
forming these personal relationships.

547
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,366
I value them a lot

548
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:40,766
and that's why I love doing

549
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:42,132
what we're doing here and getting to

550
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:42,832
know you over these years

551
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:44,199
and hopefully one day

552
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,366
I can be in front of you

553
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:47,299
and I'll be one of the thousands decks

554
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,799
that you receive in your mailbox.

555
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,899
So, hopefully sooner than later.

556
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,432
Gil, last thoughts about

557
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:55,866
where are you headed with this?

558
00:24:55,867 --> 00:24:58,299
Do you see yourself continuing with Upwest,

559
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,332
growing it into a massive VC?

560
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,932
Do you see yourself navigating potentially

561
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:04,832
to other areas? What's up with you?

562
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:08,399
So, as much as I can help it

563
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,399
and control things

564
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,832
this is the last job I wanna be doing,

565
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:12,032
right.

566
00:25:12,033 --> 00:25:14,499
... anything else.

567
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,732
It's our startup. Right? This is our startup.

568
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:18,732
This is a startup?

569
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:20,899
Upwest is a startup. We bootstrap it.

570
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,966
We raise money from people.

571
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:25,066
We're trying to grow to a certain extent.

572
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:29,032
But that's sort of what we do. Right?

573
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:31,266
I even asked you in the email. I asked you

574
00:25:31,267 --> 00:25:34,632
I thought that we might talk about

575
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,766
being a VC versus starting a startup

576
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:38,032
but you're actually starting a startup

577
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:38,732
while doing a VC.

578
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:43,299
Yeah. So, and I absolutely treat it that way.

579
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,366
I'm going forward. We're doing a scale

580
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:46,099
a little bit.

581
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,899
But ultimately what will guide us is

582
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,032
we wanna invest in very early stage

583
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:53,832
startups founded by Israelis,

584
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,932
whoever they are, and help them break

585
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:56,899
into the US market.

586
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,599
If we raise too much money,

587
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,399
it doesn’t make sense to write

588
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,066
a pre-seed or seed check.

589
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:04,766
We now have to be a serious

590
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:05,899
A fund which

591
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,032
a.) is less fun for me

592
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:10,999
b.) there's so many better investors.

593
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,866
So many better investors than us to do it.

594
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:14,866
So, we wanna specialize in being

595
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:16,166
that first check.

596
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:18,366
And so, we have to right size the fund

597
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:21,199
so we can’t raise too much. Right?

598
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,166
Gil, three words that best describe you

599
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:25,732
and now I'm ready for the cheating.

600
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:27,032
So, the cheating is

601
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:29,166
I'm a big fan of hyphens.

602
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:33,766
I will be hyphenating a little bit here.

603
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:39,466
So, on sort of the business side,

604
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:43,132
I aspired to be a trusted advisor.

605
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:45,799
So, that's a hyphenated word.

606
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,166
That's what I would like to continue to be

607
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,766
and aspire to be and hopefully

608
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:53,866
I can continue perfecting that.

609
00:26:53,867 --> 00:26:57,299
On a personal level, as you see me

610
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,466
sitting in e pink room here,

611
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:01,299
I will take on the

612
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,866
description of a simple, of like a father.

613
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:07,532
I'm still figuring it out and will likely

614
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:08,899
figure it out for a long time.

615
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,999
So, that would be my second word

616
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,166
and I didn’t cheat here.

617
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:13,532
That's not hyphenated.

618
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:15,466
I love it. So, it looks kind of white

619
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,899
but now I'll make it clear

620
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,632
this is a pink room. Gil, is sitting

621
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:21,132
in your daughter's room, right?

622
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,132
Yeah, light pink room. Exactly.

623
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:26,166
And then the third,

624
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:28,032
I didn’t know what to say.

625
00:27:28,033 --> 00:27:30,666
So, I'll just go with, and this is absolutely

626
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:34,132
hyphenated ...

627
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:39,666
I'm a proud dual citizen of Israel and the US.

628
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:43,099
But where I grew up, my roots

629
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,166
is from ...

630
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:45,599
and what that means to me is

631
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,132
community, family,

632
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:51,732
and that is where I'm from

633
00:27:51,733 --> 00:27:52,599
and where I started.

634
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,432
And frankly, all my family,

635
00:27:57,433 --> 00:28:01,266
cousins, aunts, about 40 close members

636
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:03,299
of my family all live five minutes from

637
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,566
one another. Walking distance.

638
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:05,899
And I'm the only one who isn’t.

639
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,966
So, I'm like the black sheep of the family.

640
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:15,899
But yeah, that's what hyphenated values

641
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,332
to describe myself.

642
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:18,632
Gil, toda raba. Best of luck.

643
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:19,532
It sounds amazing.

644
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:22,299
And look for my email with the deck

645
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,332
in one or two years.

646
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,732
Thank you so much.

647
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:27,232
Thank you for having me.

648
00:28:27,233 --> 00:31:23,667
Take care.
