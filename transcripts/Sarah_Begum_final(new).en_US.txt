1 So, I went there, I was hunting with the warriors. I was gathering with the warriors. Then they made me queen and married me to the warrior. To the best warrior. Sarah Begum, thank you so much for joining me, all the way from the United Kingdom. How are you? I'm good. Thanks, Matias. How are you? Thanks for having me. Thank you very, very much for being here. I really appreciate you taking the time. You know, between all the traveling, I don't know how much of that you've been able to do during covid. But, through all these extraordinary experiences that you've had, I'm especially curious as young entrepreneur on my journey, I'm trying to discover what are different cultures in the world, where there are different experiences people are having. And I can't think of anybody better to tell me about these extraordinary experiences than you. So, Sarah, why am I so excited to speak to you? I'll let you tell them yourself. Okay. So, I have travelled to remote parts of the world, living with indigenous tribes and capturing their stories. I've also survived dangerous places such as the murder capital of the world, slums and mostly undercover to tell those stories, too. So, we're going to have to spend the majority of the time hearing those stories, because myself nor my friends have gotten to be undercover in slums and the murder capital of the world. So, tell me first a little bit about your entrepreneurial and adventurous self. Where does that passion for traveling and finding those crazy adventures, what did that stem? Where does that come from? Okay. So, growing up, I grew up in a very multicultural environment with friends from all over the world, different cultures. And I was always curious. And I was curious about the world, what else is out there. At the age of nine, I learned about deforestation in the Amazon. And it became my dream to go there and save the trees, and also to visit these tribes. And at the age of 21, I was studying television film and journalism at a BA HONs at a university. But I didn't want to be just another graduate in a sea of other graduates. I wanted to stand out from the crowd. And so, during my final year, I took a month out to make my own film. I won an award that helped fund the ticket there. I used my life savings and also the university's resources, take note. And I decided to follow my childhood dream. So, I found a cameraman from New York, someone from Portsmouth and an indigenous tribe who lived primitively till this day. And I just went there. I planned the whole thing, obviously, six months in advance. And my goal was always to make it a commercial piece. My goal was also to get it in the Cannes Film Festival. So, I went there. I was hunting with the warriors. I was gathering with the warriors. Then they made me queen and married me to the warrior. To the best warrior. To the best warrior. I didn't know what was happening. I was thinking, "Wait a minute. I thought they were just making me queen." Because they had to strip me naked as well and make me one of them. So, I became one of the tribe. And that was actually to create an alliance so that I would spread their message about protecting their land from exploitation, because there's a large oil reserve where they live. And they've had years of fighting against the oil companies to preserve their land and the jungle and their home. So, when I got back, I finished my degree. And then, I started working in TV. I was taking under the wing of a prominent film directors and producers. That one of Bear Grylls directors, my role model, Bruce Parry, contacted me. That gave me hope. And then eventually, I managed to finish making this film, this TV style, half hour documentary. And I was the youngest person ever to do that, to live with a tribe and make a first film. And funny enough, as soon as I made this film, it was accepted into the Cannes Film Festival, and that's where it premiered. And it has been, I'm still making royalties from it today. So, it was acquired by Schultz TV and many other online broadcasting companies. And yeah. Talk about following your dreams, right? Yeah. Follow your dreams. But that also made me realize that this is what I want to do. I didn't realize I was an explorer and anthropologist, a journalist, I had no idea because I wanted to direct the next godfather, you know, and that didn't happen. It just, life just took a different turn. And I wanted to do something meaningful with purpose in my life. I just found it so exciting going to these remote parts of the world, learning about how these people live and just giving them a voice. And it helps them, it also helps me because I feel fulfilled. And over the years, that's what I've been doing. And jungles, I've been to the Brazilian jungle as well, and the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, with the Native Americans in the USA. I did a road trip in three weeks, 18 states on reservations, powwows everywhere. In deserts, in the Jordanian desert, the Wadi Rum desert with the Bedouin tribe. The Chai tribe in Ghana, where I lived for years, as an investigative journalist. A year. Yeah. Wait, I have to hear about this, with the Chai tribe in Ghana for a year. What is that like? So, I lived in Ghana for a year as an investigative journalist and I was with the Chai tribe. I was the only British woman at the time when they were showing me the [--] festival, to commemorate when the British kicked them out of their hilltop homes because they thought they were committing human sacrifice. It was really interesting. They were calling upon their ancestors. And we went to various sacred spots for libation and prayer and chanting. And it was really interesting, really interesting. Almost like a pilgrimage. And so, I documented that. By the way, when you go and document as an investigative journalist, so you're both an explorer, from what it sounds to me, it's like you actually become one of their own, right? I mean, you marry a warrior right in their own ceremony and make an alliance with them, and then you go and you immerse yourself in the culture and of the Chai tribe in Ghana, spending years of an investigative journalist there, but then also going to all these different cultures. And so, tell me a little bit about this immersive experience that you're having there. Because, I'm imagining that you're not just there as a journalist with a microphone and a camera all the time, right? You're actually experiencing what they're doing. So, I don't always like, I know that the camera's there, but I'm not focusing on the camera. When I'm there, I'm with them. I focus on them. And it's about human connection. So, you have to connect with them in an authentic way. And I believe by immersing yourself in a culture but completely letting go with any preconceived ideas or beliefs or values, you get a genuine and true depiction of their culture and who they are and how they live. And that creates understanding between you and their culture. And then you're able to portray that in a very honest way, you know, and a very genuine way. And I think if we all were able to do that, instead of having all these judgments about cultures before experiencing them ourselves and before communicating with people on a very honest level, you know, then we'll learn how to respect others. We can respect one another and that creates diplomacy, and that creates peace. 100%. So, I completely agree. I think it starts with a dialogue. Before the dialogue, it starts with respect and truly respecting and acknowledging the other person's way of life, which is different than your way of life. Yeah, but how can you respect what you don't know? Right. What you don't understand, you know. So, by having an immersive experience, you learn to understand. And by understanding, you then develop that respect. Right. So, before we get to talking about, you know, the different experiences that you've had, I have to hear about, you know, being in the slums and being undercover also in the murder capital of the world. But talk to me a little bit about, but I have to hear your thoughts a little bit about the impact. And at the end, you're going through these immersive experiences and obviously you're documenting and showing them with the world. And one of the insights I hear from you is in order to really respect and really acknowledge their existence and their, you know, our joint livelihood, we first have to know and understand what they are like. Right? And it's very hard to do that when we're not immersing ourselves with them. So, how can we, as a civilization, come together without actually, you know, without each person being able to go and immerse themselves with, you know, the Chai tribe in Ghana? Watch documentaries. When you see, I mean, we live in a country and in a world where we are very lucky to meet people from other parts of the world, you know. Our neighbors are different from us. Our colleagues are different from us. Have the time to maybe ask them questions about their background, about their cultures, you know, maybe what kind of music they listen to. What was the story of that artist that they really like from Senegal, and just learn about them. So, ask questions that show that you really actually care about them as a person and what's unique about them. Because when you ask questions, then you learn and then you develop that connection and understanding. And who knows, it deepens your friendship or your working relationship, whatever the relationship maybe. And also, watch documentaries, read up about those. So many different ways to explore and understand and learn without going anywhere. And do you really think that watching documentaries and exploring online without having that personal connection, is that enough? Well, I'm talking about in a pandemic, thing in a pandemic, you can speak on Zoom, you can interact with people all over the world on the Internet. That's why the Internet has been very useful. One thing I'd like to mention about the Internet is, my warriors are on Facebook. And they messaged me all the time. Now, when they first started calling me and Skyping me and sending me email, I mean, I was like," Wow." "They use email. They use the Internet. This is so cool." But it's a great way of staying connected to them. And for them, it's a great way of teaching the world about their culture. Right. And, you know, sending their message themselves. It gives them an authentic platform. So, I do think we need to make use of all the different types of apps and online education available to us. However, I believe that nothing beats human connection. So, at the moment, I mean, I don't want to say anything that will make you break the rules, broke down rules. But after lockdown, whenever that may be, it would be great for you to travel and learn about other cultures through participation, through observation, through experiences. And if you can't do that at the moment, think about who there is at home. Even your friends, maybe you haven't asked them a question that maybe you didn't think about until now. And if they're from a different culture, a different background, maybe you can go and after this, after listening to this, ask them those questions about them. Maybe you'll learn something. Who knows. I can't wait to go and practice this myself. I've been thinking for a long time about the things that I want to be doing. And what one of those things is using technology to make a positive impact. And that's on all over the world. But it's very, very hard for me to understand what really needs to happen to make a positive impact in places like, let's say, Africa or East Asia. And I think part of it is because I'm not there. It's because I'm not feeling the people. I'm not interacting with them on a daily basis. So, it's hard for me, to understand really what they need and how we can collaborate together. And I have to also mention that I've been an avid participant in Burning Man. And one of the main points of Burning Man is inclusion, diversity and understanding. And there is one rule that you are not allowed to be a bystander. You're not allowed to be a spectator. You have to participate in whatever you do. So, if you see something happening, you're not allowed to stand there and watch. You have to actually go in the circle and take an active part. And that's one of the scariest, but also most fun things for me in that. Sarah, we have about five minutes left and I'd love to hear from you some more stories about your immersive experience. Because I want you to give me this a taste of what I and my friends can experience as we go and travel the world and immerse ourselves with these. Where would you like to go? Is there a place in mind you have? Tell me a little bit about the slums. About you coming from the United Kingdom and immersing yourselves in a culture that is a little bit different, please. Yeah. So, the first time I ended up in the slums in Venezuela was by accident. And this was in Caracas. It's the capital and Petare is the name of the slums. So, Petare is the largest, most dangerous slums in all of Latin America. And I ended up there the first time by accident because the road was blocked to work. The second time, I went undercover to explore and investigate what the conditions were like there and to learn how people lived. Now, I remember, I'm seeing a space developed by a group of students from the local university there, because they believed by taking care of the spaces and renovating them, people start caring about the said spaces and it reduces crime. And once I was out there, I was in these slum houses. I was invited by a woman who happened to be a friend of one of the teachers. Now, it was so bizarre because I saw like a thousand plushies everywhere. It was like seven different levels in terms of how many level floors that were in the House. There were speakers, and like all the latest gadgets and tech and, you know, computers and music systems, everything you can think of. I was just so confused. Because I was thinking, how? Right. What they did was they sold essential goods, which in the main city was hard to find because of the shortages caused by economic crisis. And I can't believe I found toilet paper here and shampoo and milk and sugar and all these other things you couldn't find the shop in the city. So, I was like, "Whoa." However, they were being sold about three, four, five times the price. Really? Yeah. And I mean, it was just, it was just bizarre. Like if you watch my video on my YouTube channel, Surviving Caracas, you'll see. And then I do some other like short videos with longer, longer durations of those actual scenes. Yeah. It was just really bizarre. But she was nice to me and she offered me some food and drink and she was just so crazy. She wasn't really lovely. How do you even get to those opportunities? How do you go from the UK and said, "Okay. I'm going to hop on a plane and I'm going to go to Venezuela and I'm going to be in one of the most dangerous places in the world." So, that one actually I was offered to be, I was offered the role to be a journalist and anchor, a news anchor for an English government channel based over there. And I had no idea what I signed up for. So, when I went there, I discovered through my, through realizing the lines that I was expected to read on TV. It was not a true depiction of what was actually happening there. So, I decided to make a documentary undercover. I went back, I made a documentary about what was really happening. And then I, I launched that in December 2015, just before the elections. And the slums in Ghana, that was interesting because I did several stories in the slums. I did one on petty crime where a man was beaten up badly. It was like blood flowing down from his head because he refused to fix the car properly. Or he refused to do something and it was just about fixing a car. And so he was beaten up. And then I just stopped him and I asked him what happened. And he told me and I said, "Where are you going?" And he said, "Well, I'm going to the police station." I said, "Okay. Can I come with you?" He said, "Okay." So, as I was walking to the police station, there was, I was watching him report the incident. But then a man on a motorbike, he was unconscious, beaten unconscious, sandwiched between two men on this motorcycle came and they were trying to frame the guy who was reporting the incident. It was bizarre, like, wow, what's this? What's going on? And also, I went into, to investigate the conditions of the brothels in the slums. And I remember walking up into the building and almost falling through the roof. Well, the floor, you know, it was insane. And you know, these girls, they came to the city from the countryside. They had big dreams. One of them wanted to be a football player because she had talent. And she thought if she goes to the city, she can save up money or she can be spotted. But that never happened. She ended up in the brothel and she wasn't able to leave. And she was embarrassed to go back because she worried about what her parents would think. Another one I did was, I'm investigating illegal mining that, I don't really want to talk about that too much. It's like sensitive information, you know. No, no, no, Sarah, I have to, first thank you for being so generous with your time and for sharing all those experiences. I think that one of the things that I'm getting most inspired by from this is the passion and the ambition to go and experience these for myself. It's one thing hearing you talk about them, I'm sure it's a completely different world being there and actually immersing myself and indulging myself within those experiences. That some of them sound very uncomfortable, some of them sound scary, some of them sound exciting and joyful. But overall, I think it just sounds mind opening. And so, thank you for sharing that with me and thank you for instilling within me now this excitement, and hopefully anyone else who's listening. But before we leave, I have to ask you the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. Okay, adventurous, brutally-honest. Well, there's a hyphen in there. Yeah. And loving. I love to love. I believe in love a lot. I love that. Sarah, thank you very, very much. Stay safe and stay healthy. And I can't wait to follow you on the next places you're going to go to the world. And I can't wait to watch these documentaries because now I'm completely excited about them. Thank you so much, Michael. I hope you do. I hope you have more stories to share. Thank you very, very much.
