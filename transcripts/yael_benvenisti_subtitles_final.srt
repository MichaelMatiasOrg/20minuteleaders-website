1
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,000
Yael Benvenisti, thank you

2
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,680
for being on my show.

3
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,840
How are you?

4
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,840
I'm fine, thank you.

5
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,000
Really great to have you here.

6
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,040
I'm gonna learn about aging

7
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,240
in the next 20 minutes.

8
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,640
You're an expert in the longetivity space.

9
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,440
You're actually named

10
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,120
both in 2019 and 2020

11
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,840
one of Israel's top influencers

12
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,200
and experts in the longetivity space.

13
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,760
The CEO of Mediterranean Towers Ventures,

14
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,080
but you're also running a private clinic.

15
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,960
And you mentioned that that's leftovers

16
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,200
from the first degree,

17
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,000
so I'll have to understand

18
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,800
a little bit why.

19
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,720
But Yael, we have to start

20
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,400
with the fun fact

21
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,440
because who doesn't like chocolate? What?

22
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,120
Me. I hate chocolate.

23
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,360
I think I'm unique in that space

24
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,080
but really I cannot eat it.

25
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,120
It's like somebody saying

26
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,440
that they don't like music.

27
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,480
I know,

28
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,120
but really if you want to surprise me,

29
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,240
please do not bring chocolate.

30
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,880
Bring flowers, ...

31
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,450
I love it. Okay.

32
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,880
Yael, first of all,

33
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,920
before we even dive deep

34
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,000
into your personal journey,

35
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,200
give me a little bit of background

36
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,520
as to what is the longetivity space?

37
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,080
What is this thing called Aging2.0

38
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,320
that you're so passionate about?

39
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,600
Okay, well we all know

40
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,480
that the world is getting older.

41
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,440
If we are looking

42
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,080
at what is happening now,

43
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,160
there are around 12% of the population

44
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,280
that are 60 and above.

45
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,720
If we're looking at the year 2030,

46
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,360
there will be 16% of the population

47
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,120
that are 60 and above.

48
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,920
And in the year 2050,

49
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,040
there will be more than 20%.

50
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,840
That means that

51
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,880
every fifth person in the world

52
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,640
is going to be older adult.

53
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,520
And this changes our whole society.

54
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,800
And this opens a huge market

55
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,840
and opportunity for innovation.

56
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,720
And if we, as a society,

57
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,760
want to continue and provide services

58
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,120
to a growing population,

59
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,440
and still we have a limit in our budget,

60
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,200
there's no other solution

61
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,720
than to develop technologies.

62
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,960
So, I think this is the only way

63
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,160
that we should go.

64
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,800
We should really implant technologies

65
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,880
in our services, in our life

66
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,120
in order to have quality of life

67
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,040
and not just live longer.

68
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,720
So you're saying that

69
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,120
in the next dozen years,

70
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,080
we're gonna see that

71
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,840
one in five people in the world

72
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,480
are going to be elderly,

73
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,240
and that's a fantastic case

74
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,880
as to why we need to continue innovating

75
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,440
and put at least, I'm imagining, a fifth

76
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,880
of our innovative efforts

77
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,160
on the elderly population, if not more

78
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,040
because a lot of the times

79
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,560
they need more assistance, right,

80
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,080
than the younger generation.

81
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,160
Yet, if I look at the landscape

82
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,640
of startups and of innovations

83
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,440
that are happening today,

84
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,280
I don't think a fifth of them

85
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,000
are dealing with the longetivity space.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,080
Is that right?

87
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,720
That's right.

88
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,280
It feels like there a shortage.

89
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,560
Yes, because I think

90
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,880
the demographic change

91
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,200
begin just now,

92
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,480
because the baby boomers,

93
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,760
the ones that were born

94
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,560
after World War II,

95
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,680
they are just now entering

96
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,520
what we are called

97
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,560
being older adult.

98
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,560
So we just, I think in the four, three years,

99
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,920
we can see the change that is developing.

100
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,080
And we can see the big companies

101
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,400
are trying to enter the market.

102
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,200
We can see Apple Watch,

103
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,760
that is, it's a senior Apple Watch.

104
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,720
We can see Amazon, we can see Best Buy,

105
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,800
all of them are opening departments

106
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
for technologies or products

107
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,920
for the elderly.

108
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
We will see the change

109
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,640
this period, the covid-19 period,

110
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,800
had done really big things

111
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,640
with elderly and how we approach elderly.

112
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,400
And this is not only

113
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,200
about being vulnerable

114
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,480
or someone that is being fraud,

115
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,120
it's all about having a good life,

116
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,240
opportunities,

117
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,080
being active in society

118
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,400
and what will happen now

119
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,680
if I have to stay at home

120
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,160
because it's too dangerous outside.

121
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,280
How do I continue my life, my activities.

122
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,040
And technology is the answer.

123
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,640
So Yael, give me

124
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,440
a little bit of background

125
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,040
as to what needs to happen

126
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,840
in the longetivity space.

127
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,480
So, in order for us to accommodate

128
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,560
for the growing elderly population

129
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,160
and to be able to help

130
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
improving their lives as well,

131
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,840
what spaces within the longetivity space

132
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,920
do we need to focus on?

133
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,880
Is it health care?

134
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,280
Is it loneliness?

135
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,800
Is it communication?

136
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,480
What do you think?

137
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,160
Well Aging2.0 which is organization,

138
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,320
it's an international organization,

139
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,520
based in San Francisco

140
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,920
but it has, I think,

141
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,960
almost 150 ambassadors

142
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,760
all over the world.

143
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,720
We are the Israeli ambassadors.

144
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,680
They define eight segments in which

145
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,160
we can see technologies for aging well.

146
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,080
The first one is engagement and purpose.

147
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,600
The second one is financial wellness,

148
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,400
mobility and movement,

149
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,560
daily living and lifestyle,

150
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,800
caregiving or care coordination,

151
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,640
brain health and the end of life.

152
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,160
In each segment, we can see

153
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,760
a various of technologies

154
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,920
like virtual reality, augmented reality,

155
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,080
robots, IOT, artificial intelligence,

156
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,840
machine learning.

157
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,600
The type of technology is not important;

158
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,840
it is the space

159
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,520
that they are connected with.

160
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,600
And if we will invest in those area,

161
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,320
we will see individual well-being

162
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,520
and well health.

163
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,960
We can see workforce participation,

164
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,760
because people will be able

165
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,920
to work longer.

166
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,720
We will see a raise in the consumption

167
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,080
because people will buy more things,

168
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,920
so they will continue

169
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,480
and develop the economic of the country.

170
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,920
We will see a lot of innovation

171
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,640
because this is an empty space.

172
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,640
It just begin in these activities.

173
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,400
So by the way, Yael,

174
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,000
out of those eight segments

175
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,640
that you were talking about,

176
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,400
which one are you most attracted to?

177
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,360
Because I could make

178
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,840
a very strong case as to why

179
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,480
you should be passionate

180
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,360
about all of them,

181
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,800
but what really gets you excited?

182
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,760
I think that continue your lifestyle

183
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,160
and daily living

184
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,680
will make the the biggest change

185
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,880
in our life.

186
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,680
So, can you clarify?

187
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,600
Does that mean that people

188
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,760
will not stop living

189
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,480
the way that they are living

190
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,800
just because they're getting older

191
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,320
and they're having more challenges

192
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,320
because of their physiology?

193
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,200
This is exactly what I'm saying.

194
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,000
It doesn't matter

195
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,360
if you cannot leave your home,

196
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,960
if you have some disability;

197
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,600
you will continue your favorite lifestyle,

198
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,520
you will continue to be active

199
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,640
in your community, in your family,

200
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,360
do what you like to do.

201
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,960
Even if you will stay at your home,

202
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,000
that doesn't mean that

203
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,760
you will not have a community

204
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,280
to be engaged in or friends or family

205
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,440
or doing whatever you want.

206
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,840
Learning something new.

207
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,280
Right. But I'm thinking still, Yael,

208
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,040
today. The past 20 years,

209
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,160
we've had such a boom

210
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,560
in consumer technology

211
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,760
and things that are helping us

212
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,640
live our lives better,

213
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,360
yet even my own grandparents, who are 85,

214
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,320
and they have a phone and everything,

215
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,960
there's still no technology

216
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,760
that is helping us communicate better

217
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,000
and is helping ...

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,160
between the generation gaps.

219
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,040
You know I'm thinking about

220
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,640
my six year old niece

221
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,160
and my 85 year old grandmother,

222
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,880
they love talking to each other.

223
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,320
And it's getting,

224
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,240
I can just imagine that if they will be

225
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,520
disconnected geographically,

226
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,280
it'll be nearly impossible

227
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,520
to bridge that communication gap.

228
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,280
So why even today isn't there

229
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,360
any practical solutions for these,

230
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,280
because the market is already here?

231
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,600
Well there is,

232
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,680
but there is a lack of knowledge.

233
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,520
There is a lack of knowledge at your side,

234
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,840
as a family member,

235
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,360
and a lack of knowledge

236
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,240
in your grandmother or grandfather side.

237
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,800
So, we are doing what we can

238
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,120
in order to spread the ...

239
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,440
but it's hard.

240
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,880
I personally have a segment

241
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,480
in one of the commercial TV channels,

242
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,000
in one of the morning shows.

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,240
So, I'm trying to spread the ...

244
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,480
that there are solutions,

245
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,080
there are wonderful solution,

246
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,360
even for people

247
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,360
that are not technologists at all.

248
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,560
They don't know how to operate Zoom,

249
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,000
they don't know how to push a button,

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,440
they don't know how to operate

251
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,680
the WhatsApp video.

252
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,960
There is a technology using the TV screen

253
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,240
or even just using a regular screen

254
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,360
that is not a TV,

255
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,440
that when you schedule in an hour,

256
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,880
the video conversation will be open.

257
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,480
The person just had to sit

258
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,480
in front the screen and that's it.
- I love it

259
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,880
That's all it is.

260
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,680
... and the cost is so low, really.

261
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,000
It cost around one dollar a day.

262
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,960
It's nothing,

263
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,160
but people do not know.

264
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,120
So we have work to do.

265
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,720
Definitely. I actually,

266
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,200
I participated in a hackathon

267
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,480
here in Palo Alto at Y Combinator

268
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,160
a few months ago

269
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
with my friends from Stanford.

270
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,360
And we developed this app

271
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,000
where we put a camera on the TV,

272
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,760
and when the grandchild calls

273
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,160
their grandfather a grandmother

274
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,920
on the phone, it shows on their TV.

275
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,320
And then all the elderly person has to do

276
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,640
is wave in front of the camera

277
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,120
and it'll open,

278
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,320
more for the accessibility side,

279
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,600
but we were still shocked

280
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,240
that the number of solutions,

281
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,920
even if a few do exist,

282
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,720
it's still very limited.

283
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,680
But Yael, I'd love to learn

284
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,520
a little bit more

285
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,960
about what you're doing specifically

286
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,520
with Mediterranean Towers Ventures,

287
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,520
and how specifically you got into this.

288
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,120
Because you're very young.

289
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,400
You can be doing anything else

290
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,800
... doing venture capital,

291
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,080
yet you're excited about

292
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,160
the longetivity space,

293
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,400
and I have to really understand why.

294
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,760
Well, it all started years ago.

295
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,200
I was a young physiotherapist

296
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,280
working one of the HMOs.

297
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,000
And my grandma was a resident

298
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,560
in one of the nursing homes

299
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,160
in my hometown.

300
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,680
And one night the staff,

301
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,720
they didn't close the bars

302
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,480
of the beds properly.

303
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,040
And the bars fell down and she rolled over

304
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,400
and she hit her head in the bleacher

305
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,320
that was standing near the bed.

306
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,040
And she died from a brain hemorrhage.
- Oh no

307
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,800
So at that point, I made the decision

308
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,680
that this will never happen again.

309
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,920
I quit my job.

310
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,960
I went to learn rehabilitation

311
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,000
and geriatrics and start working

312
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,840
in rehabilitation centers

313
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,880
and in nursing homes

314
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,720
with elderly people.

315
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,760
And I just loved it.

316
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,120
And I continue looking for solutions

317
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,680
that these sort of things

318
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,360
will never happen again.

319
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,000
And then I joined the society,

320
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,520
the Electrical and Electronic

321
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,080
Engineering Society in Israel.

322
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,800
They opened a new group,

323
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,600
Technologies for Aging Well.

324
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,640
And I was elected as the chairman.

325
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,800
We started 14 people

326
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,120
around one table.

327
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,720
Didn't know what to do.

328
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,720
Now we are more than 1,500 members.

329
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,400
So, we are very proud.

330
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,400
We have a very nice ecosystem.

331
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,600
Very active.

332
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,440
Yes. So, you were elected chairman

333
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,400
to the organization, to the society.

334
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,120
Yes. And we started as 14 people

335
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,240
around one table,

336
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,560
and we really didn't know what to do.

337
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,200
And now, we are more than 1,500 members.

338
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,600
A very active ecosystem.

339
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,400
We are very proud.

340
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,560
We joined Aging2.0

341
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,000
that is international organization.

342
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,120
And two years ago, two and a half years ago,

343
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,840
Mediterranean Towers Venture,

344
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,720
which is a publicly traded company,

345
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,920
they came to one of our conference

346
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,600
and they said that they want to open

347
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,880
a CVC, corporate venture capital,

348
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,720
and invest in technologies for aging well.

349
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,640
Mediterranean Towers Group is a company

350
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,400
that is running

351
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,160
independent living facilities in Israel.

352
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,720
It's the biggest private

353
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,520
independent ... facilities in Israel.

354
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,000
And we opened the fund.

355
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,480
This is the only venture capital in Israel

356
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,600
that invest in this space.

357
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,760
We are very proud.
- Wow.

358
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,600
And we open, even if we don't invest in a company,

359
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,760
we open our facilities for focus group

360
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,120
or for beta testing,

361
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,200
and we try really to give a push

362
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,640
to the whole ecosystem in Israel.

363
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,320
Right. It sounds like it's beyond

364
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,840
just another venture capital firm.

365
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,160
This is, it's a mission driven fund

366
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,640
that is about the community

367
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,800
and about fostering

368
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,280
an innovative community

369
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,240
in the startup nation

370
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,960
to help, also motivate, more people

371
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,800
to create companies in this space.

372
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,880
So, even if you don't invest

373
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,760
you're actually helping them

374
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
continue to grow

375
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,800
and develop the relationship with them.

376
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,600
It's not just a financial transaction.

377
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,840
It's much more about a community, right?

378
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,240
Right.

379
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,120
Each year we're doing a competition.

380
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,960
And our judges

381
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,320
is not just a panelist of experts,

382
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,320
it's also our residents.

383
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,680
They get a chance to vote

384
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,640
and they get a chance

385
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,040
to ask the entrepreneurs

386
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,920
all the questions.

387
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,120
And they're really doing a great job.

388
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,680
It's not easy to stand on the stage

389
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,760
and to answer their questions,

390
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,560
because they have very good questions.

391
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,000
And we are very proud

392
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,920
that they really are active and they shape

393
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,960
the next generation of products

394
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,040
for the elderly generation.

395
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,200
So, putting on the investment hat,

396
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,080
are the returns in this space

397
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,320
the same as in other spaces

398
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,600
like cybersecurity

399
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,520
and other consumer technologies?

400
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,240
Like what are the differences

401
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,080
between the longetivity space

402
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,480
and investing exclusively or primarily

403
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,680
in the longetivity space

404
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,680
rather than other funds

405
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,400
that may be focusing on other industries?

406
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,480
Well first of all,

407
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,480
we are focused in the space

408
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,240
and not in the technology.

409
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,000
So, I think we are very young space,

410
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,200
so the number of exits are really small.

411
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,760
But we can see the trend.

412
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,800
We can see that

413
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,120
all these technologies are raising.

414
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,240
When I think two years ago

415
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,800
we saw most of the companies

416
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,200
raising seed money.

417
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,960
Now we can see they passed A-round

418
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,840
and they are continue to developing. Ours,

419
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,680
we made three investments,

420
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,920
all of them are now passed A-rounds.

421
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,680
So, we are very proud.

422
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,040
And it's only two years ago,

423
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,520
so it happens fast.
- Wonderful

424
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,440
We can see the trend.

425
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,960
We can see the really

426
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,760
the potential in this area.

427
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,200
It's like FinTech five years ago.

428
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,520
You have to be patient.

429
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,360
No, no I love it. Yeah.

430
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,000
but it will happen,

431
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,920
definitely it will happen.

432
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,600
So Yael, for myself and for my friends

433
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,680
who are watching this,

434
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,600
we're also considering

435
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
what to start their next venture,

436
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
and as we know, especially in Israel,

437
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,760
it is very common

438
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,360
out of the intelligence unit

439
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,560
to go more into the cybersecurity spaces

440
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,000
and those types of fields.

441
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,800
But I'd love to hear a few ideas

442
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,160
just to get the juices running

443
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,400
for young entrepreneurs

444
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,040
that are thinking of what to do next.

445
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,240
And I want to understand really

446
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,960
what are the opportunities in this space.

447
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,240
And maybe you can give me

448
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,120
two or three high level ideas of problems

449
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,200
that one can tackle

450
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
in the aging and longetivity space

451
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,240
using technology.

452
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,160
Well first of all,

453
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,200
when we are talking about technologies

454
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,080
for aging well,

455
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,920
we are talking about a platform

456
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,160
that will combine several services,

457
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,440
because we cannot put a lot of devices

458
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,880
in your house and use them

459
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
at the same time.

460
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,320
It's too complicated,

461
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,640
and it's too expensive.

462
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,320
So you have to build a platform

463
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,420
that will give a service

464
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,560
service,

465
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:26,440
and the service must solve some need.

466
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,080
Cybersecurity is nice,

467
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,080
but it doesn't solve a problem for me

468
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,320
as an individual.

469
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,080
But as an older adult

470
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,480
that wants to continue

471
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,440
and live his life like he used to do,

472
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,280
it must solve a problem,

473
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,520
some need.

474
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,440
This is a very big difference.

475
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,840
And I think that every entrepreneur

476
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,360
that is entering the space

477
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,680
must think about who is the customer

478
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,520
and who is the payer.

479
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,760
It's not the same person most of the time.

480
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,480
Right. Right.

481
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,560
And it's a little bit complicated.

482
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,800
But if I'm comparing this

483
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,840
to the younger generation,

484
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,360
you must understand that the product

485
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,240
that you are selling

486
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,440
for a three years old child

487
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,880
is not the same product that you will sell

488
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,280
for a 16 years old child.

489
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
This is the same

490
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,560
as the older adult population;

491
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,080
you cannot sell the same product

492
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,920
for a 65 years old person

493
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,160
or to a 90 year old person.

494
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,080
This is a huge population,

495
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,640
a lot of segmentation,

496
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,200
inner segmentation, especially

497
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,680
the ability to perform your activity,

498
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,160
how activity you are.

499
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,080
You have to do a good segmentation

500
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,120
of the population

501
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,760
and know who is your customer,

502
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,080
what you are selling,

503
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,320
and who will want to pay for it.

504
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,160
I think that's fascinating.

505
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,360
And I've been thinking quite a bit

506
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,040
about this space,

507
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,880
and one of the things

508
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,320
that really intrigued me is that

509
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,440
this space, more so than a lot of others,

510
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,480
like you said, a lot of times

511
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,360
the person who is using your product

512
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,400
is not necessarily the person

513
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,720
who's buying the product.

514
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,880
So you have almost

515
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,080
like a two sided marketplace

516
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,000
and you have to really understand

517
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,600
who are the moving players in this puzzle.

518
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,200
But it's really, really fascinating.

519
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,680
Yael, so I understand the passion

520
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,480
that you're coming in doing this.

521
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,200
Do you see yourself

522
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,320
staying in this space for a long time?

523
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,400
I know that you also are still practicing

524
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,640
from your original profession

525
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,040
out of a love for that profession,

526
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,760
but do you see yourself continuing

527
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,600
with that mission for many years to come?

528
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,160
Or is this something that you're saying,

529
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,480
I want to make a dent now

530
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,920
and potentially later I'll move on

531
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,720
to different industries?

532
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,160
No, I will say in this industry

533
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,960
it has a huge potential.

534
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,320
I saw more than 250 companies

535
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,160
in three years.

536
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,920
I see the activity.

537
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,600
I have a lot of knowledge today

538
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,640
that I didn't have four years ago.

539
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,760
I want to give it to our entrepreneurs

540
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,840
and really to put Israel

541
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,400
as the leading country

542
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,880
for AgeTech in the world.

543
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,760
I love it. Okay,

544
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,440
and on that note Yael,

545
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,360
I need three words that you would use

546
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,480
to describe yourself,

547
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,400
and I need you to explain

548
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,000
a little bit about these words.

549
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,400
Well, I'm a perfectionist person.

550
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,200
I love perfection, really.

551
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,000
I have to learn about everything

552
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,320
and to understand it

553
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,440
until I make a decision.

554
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,960
I live a good life, really.

555
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,440
I'm having a good life.

556
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,920
I love coming to my work.

557
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,920
I'm coming every day with passion,

558
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,840
I see a lot of new things,

559
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,000
and I feel that I can contribute

560
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,960
to the space.

561
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,120
And the last word is a blonde

562
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,560
... the color.

563
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,200
I'm not a neutral tone.

564
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,800
I love it.

565
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,120
Yes.

566
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,480
And it's really fun because

567
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,200
when people see me,

568
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,840
they know my degree,

569
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,600
that I have a PhD in geriatrics,

570
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,280
and when I come to a conference

571
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,240
or to a meeting, they say,

572
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,040
"Wow. You?"

573
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,760
I said,

574
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,160
"Yes. I'm shaping my future.

575
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,280
I'm doing it for me.

576
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,960
My future will look different"

577
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,920
Well your future,

578
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,880
but it sounds like you're also

579
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,960
in the process of helping millions

580
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,840
if not billions of others down the line.

581
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,720
So, shaping your future while shaping

582
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,000
everybody else's future as well.

583
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,240
Yael, thank you very, very much

584
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,880
for the inspiration.

585
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,080
This was wonderful.

586
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,360
I'm personally very passionate

587
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,560
about this space that you're in,

588
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,440
and that's why I was so excited

589
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,040
when you agreed to do

590
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,920
this episode with me.

591
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,080
And I hope that I'll definitely take

592
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,000
an active part in this space,

593
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,840
and I hope that my friends,

594
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,280
both at Stanford and 8200,

595
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,520
will also consider this as a viable path

596
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,000
in their entrepreneurship journey.

597
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,320
And thank you for all the insights

598
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,120
over the past 20 minutes.

599
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,720
Thank you.

600
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,600
Take care.

601
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,560
Bye.
