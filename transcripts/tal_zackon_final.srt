1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,840
I have a team here

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,800
that came with one idea,

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,160
and they already pivoted

4
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,000
two or three times.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We have a team that came in

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,040
and people look at the idea

7
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,120
and they were like, "What?

8
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,560
How am I supposed to analyze this?

9
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,520
I've never heard of something like this."

10
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,880
And we said, "Okay, here's a 100k,

11
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,700
let's work together."

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,160
Tal Zackon, thank you

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,600
for joining me on 20 minute leaders.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:45,920
How are you?

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,720
Thank you for having me.

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,360
It's great to be here.

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,040
Calling straight

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,840
from the F2 offices, right?

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,800
Yes. Actually, as you said,

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,760
the lighting was not good

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,960
in my office, I'm in my partner's office.

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,520
It's my aspiring position.

23
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,560
I love that.

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,000
I definitely love that.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,800
Tal, can we talk about pre-seed.

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,480
F2 Capital, the junction

27
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,560
that one of my best friends, Mickey,

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,680
has also had the pleasure

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
of being a part of,

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,440
but also, about the interesting journey

31
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,728
of both being

32
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:18,441
one arm in startup scene and

33
00:01:18,442 --> 00:01:20,000
one arm in the investment scene,

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,880
and you know,

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,120
cross bordering the insights.

36
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,080
But before we get there,

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,400
tell me a little bit about your journey,

38
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,920
and how do you find yourself

39
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,920
in venture capital?

40
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,000
Sure.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,080
Well, you know, I actually,

42
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,560
I told this story a few times.

43
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,212
So, do you want to start

44
00:01:35,213 --> 00:01:36,520
from South Africa

45
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,280
where I was born

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
or should I go straight forward

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,320
to me joining the F2?

48
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,160
If we had enough time,

49
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,760
we would go back

50
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,840
to when your parents were born.

51
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,320
Bute we'll start when you were born.

52
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,960
Okay, cool.

53
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,080
So, I'm originally

54
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,360
from Cape Town, South Africa.

55
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,280
I moved to Israel

56
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,680
when I was five, with my parents.

57
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,120
I'm not going to go into that

58
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,400
my whole childhood story

59
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,120
but when I was 18,

60
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,200
I joined the army,

61
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,560
I joined the Special Forces

62
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,480
Intelligence Unit.

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,760
And then after the army after six years,

64
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,960
serving as a combatant and a captain,

65
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,920
went to study to IDC business.

66
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,040
And for my studies,

67
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,800
I did an exchange program at USC,

68
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,680
University of Southern California.

69
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,040
So, I was about 26 at the time,

70
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,960
and then all the others around me

71
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,280
were about, youngest were like 18,

72
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,640
straight out of the high school

73
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,480
into college.

74
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,320
And some of the other exchange guys

75
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
were like 21, 22.

76
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,680
And in Israel it's not common

77
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,200
to have internships.

78
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,520
And all my friends,

79
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,360
were like, yeah, I'm going back home,

80
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,040
I'm going to be working

81
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,400
for Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, McKinsey.

82
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
And I was like, "Man,

83
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,480
I have a semester

84
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,280
that I have nothing to do.

85
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,280
What should I be up to?"

86
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,520
So, I decided to be proactive

87
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,000
and reach out

88
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
to bunch of VCs on LinkedIn.

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,560
Until this day

90
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,200
I say that any VC in Israel,

91
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,160
if they go into their LinkedIn inbox,

92
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
they'll find a message from me

93
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,560
from like, 2017 saying,

94
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,440
Hi, my name is Tal

95
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,640
and I want to work for you.

96
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,440
I think none of them responded seriously.

97
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,960
One did, Johnny Saacks from a F2 VC.

98
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,160
And before that of course,

99
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,440
he was at Genesis.

100
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,200
He said, "Let's meet for coffee."

101
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,960
I came to meet him.

102
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,440
I asked to join. He said, "No."

103
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,120
I said, "Please."

104
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,800
He said, "Okay."

105
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,000
That's the short version.

106
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,720
And two days after, I started at F2.

107
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,200
And since then I've been

108
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,600
at the fund for three years.

109
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,440
Wow.

110
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,400
Tell me a little bit about F2 about,

111
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
about some of the insights

112
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,120
that you've had at F2,

113
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,840
but also about what F2 is all about

114
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,120
as a venture capital fund.

115
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,480
Sure. Sure.

116
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,040
So, F2, we are seed stage

117
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,520
specialized venture capital firm,

118
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,139
investing in Israeli

119
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,000
early stage companies.

120
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,280
We believe that's all about the people,

121
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,600
It's all about the founders.

122
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,680
We put the founders in the center

123
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,720
and we do everything we can

124
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,800
to be an extension

125
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,680
of their core founding team.

126
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,440
We invest in deep technology,

127
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,000
focusing on machine learning, AI,

128
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,640
big data connectivity.

129
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,960
So, it's pretty general,

130
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,480
but there has to be some

131
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,720
kind of aspect leveraging data

132
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,200
or machine learning internally.

133
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,480
Now, you know these are buzzwords,

134
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,520
but we do have the capabilities

135
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,720
in terms of network

136
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,360
and in-house knowledge

137
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,320
to really determine

138
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,920
if this is real technology

139
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,440
and leveraging state of the art machinery

140
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,280
and data science.

141
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,080
As part of F2, we also have

142
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,320
the platform called the Junction,

143
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,560
which is the pre-seed platform.

144
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,880
And that's kind of our premise

145
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,760
to the ecosystem.

146
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,320
So, we go much earlier than anyone else.

147
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,280
So, besides investing C stage,

148
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,840
which is the core business,

149
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,640
we also do pre-seed investments.

150
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,120
And that's when we see a team

151
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,320
that we feel the risk

152
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,560
is too high for putting in

153
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,960
a couple of million dollars,

154
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,240
so, we will invite them

155
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,640
to come sit at our office

156
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,920
at the same time

157
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,960
and also, give them all the variance,

158
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,240
we give our preferred companies

159
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,240
while also investing on a safe,

160
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,760
a few hundred case

161
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,040
and working with them towards

162
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,200
the seed round.

163
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,440
So, tell me a little bit about

164
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,560
the pre-seed in general.

165
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,800
It's very rare that a proper VC goes

166
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,120
and writes pre-seed checks

167
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,080
or present at the forefront.

168
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,280
You're actually the general manager

169
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,840
of the Junction.

170
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,120
So, what is the junction?

171
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,280
And what are some

172
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,120
of the thought process behind pre-seed?

173
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,960
I did meet a few very interesting people

174
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,200
that are in Palo Alto

175
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,720
that are working on the assumption that,

176
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:19,960
you know,

177
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,720
by reaching the founders early

178
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,680
and going through the journey

179
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,640
and actually when you reach

180
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,840
the millions of dollars of checks,

181
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,920
you actually have much more data

182
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,280
to base your due diligence on.

183
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,000
I know that 15, 18 fund,

184
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
it's a relatively new fund.

185
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,135
They write even thousand dollar checks

186
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:34,320
to founders as a gift,

187
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,800
no equity, just to get to know them

188
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,440
and to go on their journey with them.

189
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,680
But tell me a little bit about

190
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,560
what the thesis behind the junction.

191
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,440
I think that,

192
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,400
as you described it very well,

193
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,680
it's about building a relationship.

194
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:48,680
So, all founders,

195
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,920
especially first timers around,

196
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,400
walking around the ecosystem

197
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,920
trying to raise funds,

198
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,520
and it's very important to understand

199
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,280
that they aren't competing

200
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,320
only against the companies

201
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,400
that are doing what they are doing.

202
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,680
They are competing against

203
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,920
any other startup

204
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,080
that has been established,

205
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,280
all went to fundraising

206
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,520
in the past two months.

207
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,080
So, that's a very difficult competition.

208
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,120
And the process of raising funds

209
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,160
can take even six months

210
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,040
if you are really having

211
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,840
a hard time proving the value

212
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,560
of what you are doing,

213
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,720
and you also need a team

214
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,000
to believe in you.

215
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,200
What we offer at Junction

216
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
is a very quick

217
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,080
due diligence process

218
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,120
that takes about a week.

219
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,840
And we can offer at the end,

220
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,520
100, 200, $300,000

221
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,680
and offer them to come work with us

222
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,480
and build a relationship

223
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,760
with a venture capital firm.

224
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,000
So, we also provide all this knowledge

225
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,360
and this knowledge base

226
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,120
of how venture capital firms work.

227
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,840
And also from our experience

228
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,480
working with startups,

229
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,680
we can advise them

230
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,240
on what's the best thing to do.

231
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,720
So, we have teams here

232
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,880
that came with these crazy ideas

233
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,680
that all the VCs said like, no,

234
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,320
and we were able

235
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,280
to build a relationship,

236
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,640
help them build the business

237
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,360
and develop the idea

238
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,680
and then go and launch

239
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,440
a very successful seed round.

240
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,640
In 2019, we had

241
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,200
a few companies come through.

242
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,560
And I think all of them,

243
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,160
one maybe out of the 18 raise,

244
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,560
but all of them raised seed rounds

245
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,160
from really well-known

246
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,320
Israeli seed funds.

247
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,280
So, it's about building the relationship,

248
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,000
understanding how the VC ecosystem works,

249
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,360
bringing the value add

250
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,440
and building the relationship,

251
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,880
which is really, really important

252
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,480
because they get to know us

253
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,200
and they will understand if they want

254
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,360
to even work with us in the future,

255
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,840
and we get to know them.

256
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,720
It's a six-month or four-month

257
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
live due diligence.

258
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,320
It's like the best thing, both sides.

259
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,600
So, the pre-seed, you know,

260
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,640
from my perspective,

261
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,000
pre-seed stage really is a few people

262
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,520
that have a passion,

263
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,320
that found a cumulative passion together,

264
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,200
they think they have the right expertise

265
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,160
to go and tackle the problem.

266
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,960
The not usually

267
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:47,160
don't even have a product

268
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,400
let alone product market fit,

269
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,080
they go and they want to raise funds

270
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,200
that they were able to come

271
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,680
and bring some into fruition,

272
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,000
possibly even get a few clients

273
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,920
to raise a proper seed round.

274
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,840
Is that too early to talk about VC?

275
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,560
Because from one perspective,

276
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,200
you can say that

277
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,640
at the pre-seed stage,

278
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,800
you really should be focusing

279
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,040
on being with a team together

280
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,440
working day and night

281
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,320
and getting that technology there.

282
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,240
But it sounds to me that

283
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,040
from your perspective,

284
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,840
it's not too early

285
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,080
because getting those relationships

286
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,280
can only be beneficial

287
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,320
as you actually go in

288
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,120
and want to raise

289
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,720
a meaningful round later on.

290
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,400
I think that these benchmarks of,

291
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,600
if I have a presentation

292
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,120
and then I have customers, can I raise?

293
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,200
If I have $100,000 in MRR, can I raise?

294
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,280
These are discussions

295
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,760
that I think founders try

296
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,560
and understand the formula

297
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,880
of how VCs work.

298
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,160
There's no formula.

299
00:08:38,161 --> 00:08:39,800
There are different risks

300
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,920
that some VCs feel more comfortable with

301
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,880
and some that others don't.

302
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,040
And that's how it works.

303
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,240
If I see a team with great potential,

304
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,920
and I feel like I want to work with them

305
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,760
and it's something that

306
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,240
I can do with them

307
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,920
and they are targeting

308
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,960
an interesting problem

309
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,080
or an interesting market,

310
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,520
they still aren't quite sure,

311
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,080
but if I feel that

312
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,920
if I can work with them

313
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,720
for the next few months

314
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,160
they will be able to build something

315
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,320
then I would like to work with them.

316
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,040
And it's okay if they have a presentation

317
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,200
and they haven't even written

318
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,280
a line of code.

319
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,960
I have a team here

320
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,920
that came with one idea

321
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,280
and they already pivoted

322
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,120
two or three times.

323
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,160
We have a team that came in

324
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,160
and people look at the idea

325
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,240
and they were like, "What?

326
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,680
How am I supposed to analyze this?

327
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,640
I've never heard of something like this."

328
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,040
And we said, "Okay, here's a 100K,

329
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,280
let's work together."

330
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,600
Fast forward four months,

331
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,160
one million dollars are raised.

332
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,760
It's going to YC starting in two weeks.

333
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,440
Things, you know, things develop.

334
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:33,680
You just need to look at the team

335
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,560
and see the potential

336
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,680
and take a bet

337
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,880
and what we do here is that

338
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,040
because our core business

339
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,000
is the seed investing,

340
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,800
a pre-seed investment is kind of,

341
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,920
I wouldn't say cheap

342
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,920
but easy for us to deploy

343
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,680
and take those kind of bets.

344
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,520
Betting with the seed round

345
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,280
is more difficult

346
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,000
because at the end of the day,

347
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,520
we only have 15 bullets

348
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,280
that we can shoot during

349
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,520
the active lifetime of the fund.

350
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,160
100%

351
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,240
So, at the end,

352
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,360
when it comes down to the seed round,

353
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,720
how does the due diligence process

354
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,560
look like for a company

355
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,800
that you've been following along

356
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,320
with the Junction through the pre-seed?

357
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,600
Is it basically, you know,

358
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,800
tell us when you're ready to raise

359
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,760
and then we'll sort of know already

360
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,200
if it is, or do you do the whole process

361
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,240
as if it's a new company?

362
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,800
How does that actually work tangibly?

363
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,920
So, it's actually very different

364
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,280
because we've been working with them

365
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,400
and have these biweeklies

366
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,640
and these ongoing discussions.

367
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,360
We are super up to date

368
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,000
with what's going on with the company.

369
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,160
So, sometimes we will even be proactive

370
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,000
and come to come and say,

371
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,720
"Hey guys, this is time to scale.

372
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,520
We're going to be leading

373
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,760
a four million dollar round.

374
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,360
Let's go for it."

375
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,720
You can also bring the follow up

376
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,360
like, we will do this for you.

377
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,860
And sometimes they'll be like,

378
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:44,000
"Okay, now we want the money."

379
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,960
And we'll sit down and say,

380
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,520
are we ready, are we not.

381
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,280
Should we offer them

382
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,000
another two months

383
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,440
and then go for the raise.

384
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,920
So, it's kind of this

385
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,880
very friendly discussion

386
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,760
in order to optimize for both sides.

387
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,480
It sounds like a really, mainly,

388
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
it takes away a lot of the stress

389
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,360
of considering, okay

390
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,520
how are we going to be able to fundraise

391
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,520
and who do we fundraise from

392
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,160
and how do we allocate now

393
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,960
five months of our CEO's time

394
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,720
to just go on this road show

395
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,280
where you can have

396
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,440
this invaluable partner that not only

397
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,560
gives you that $300,000 in the beginning,

398
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,520
but gets you to the place

399
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,240
where you can be confident yourself

400
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,720
about whether you're able to raise

401
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,000
the proper seed round.

402
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,880
And by that, obviously,

403
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
we're not talking about the metrics

404
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,480
that we're talking about,

405
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,680
whether you're actually creating

406
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,920
a viable business

407
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,240
that could actually be impactful right?

408
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,520
100%.

409
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,642
And one more thing, you have fun.

410
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:35,920
I mean, it's fun.

411
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:37,760
The vibe here is incredible.

412
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,640
I have different startups coming

413
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,400
for seed round discussions

414
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,840
with different people from the ecosystem

415
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,040
and you come into the office

416
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,440
and this kind of this,

417
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,840
this really cool buzz of like

418
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,040
think about we have about

419
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,360
at the moment,

420
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,320
we have five startups sitting here, okay?

421
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,640
One of the startups, as I said,

422
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,000
grew to almost 12 people.

423
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:56,700
They are in our office, [--] for them.

424
00:11:56,701 --> 00:11:57,841
I love them.

425
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,040
They are catching all the meeting ups.

426
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,720
Anyway, the buzz of something

427
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,440
is always happening,

428
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,540
all these meeting rooms

429
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,640
are filled with people

430
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,680
talking and drawing on the boards,

431
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,600
and do this and do that.

432
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,120
And this kind of a sense of community

433
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,680
and we have happy hours.

434
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,520
So, I'm fortunate

435
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,320
because I get to work also at a VC fund,

436
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,480
but also with five stops

437
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,200
at the same time.

438
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,200
So, you get of like really

439
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,520
alternative kind of environment

440
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,840
that you're not really used to

441
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,680
when you enter

442
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,080
a venture capital firms office.

443
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,560
I love that.

444
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,800
So, it's like additionally,

445
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,520
and with a really great segue

446
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,280
to working both

447
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,960
with startups and in VC,

448
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,200
you actually took a little trip down,

449
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,360
startup plane now,

450
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,000
a big trip as head of growth

451
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,840
at Superwise.ai,

452
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,120
while also spending time with F2.

453
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,440
And going back to F2,

454
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,400
you mentioned the [--].

455
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,200
But talk to me a little bit

456
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,760
about this transition.

457
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,200
Why you even do this

458
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,080
and what have you learned

459
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,520
along the way?

460
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,880
Cool.

461
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,200
This has been

462
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,080
kind of this self reflection

463
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,840
that I've been having for the past,

464
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,680
couple of months.

465
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,480
And I think I've discussed

466
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,040
with many people in the ecosystem.

467
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,560
As an investor,

468
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,200
I've heard many times

469
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,400
and I don't have startup experience,

470
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,280
I didn't have until now,

471
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,240
how can you evaluate a company

472
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,000
without really knowing

473
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,040
what a startup is about?

474
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,560
Maybe you should get

475
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,120
some operational experience.

476
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,280
And I've been trying to convince myself

477
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,160
and read studies

478
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,880
that there's no correlation between

479
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,240
people that were operators or investors

480
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,840
that were previously operators

481
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,680
and being a good investor.

482
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,000
And I still think that it's true.

483
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,520
But I feel that I need to gain

484
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,640
some operational experience

485
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,480
and feel what the founders feel.

486
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,983
So, when I say to a founder,

487
00:13:43,984 --> 00:13:46,040
"You know, startups are crazy

488
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,040
and it's really hard work."

489
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,400
Now I can say, yes,

490
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,920
I'm working at a startup

491
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,240
and it sucks, super tough.

492
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,080
And I've been learning so much

493
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,000
from working with the Superwise team.

494
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,200
The company raised $4.5 million

495
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,760
in seed about a year ago.

496
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Hopefully, we'll be going

497
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,760
for an A-round soon.

498
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,200
The team is about 15 people,

499
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,560
so, it's exactly the type of companies

500
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,480
that I would like to work with

501
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,600
because these are the companies

502
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,160
we invest in.

503
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,520
And of course, as a seed investor,

504
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,800
usually when companies get

505
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,520
to B, C, D rounds

506
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,280
the seed investors

507
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,800
kind of a part of the board,

508
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,240
but the growth investors take lead

509
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,600
on how to navigate the company.

510
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,720
So, I think it's very important to,

511
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,360
what's important for me at least

512
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,760
to understand what this

513
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
what the company looks like.

514
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,406
So, it's like

515
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:34,000
building the go to market strategy

516
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,320
and talking to customers

517
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,240
and doing these demos

518
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,360
and follow ups.

519
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,320
And suddenly, from being

520
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,360
on the buying side,

521
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,560
the companies come to me and say,

522
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,480
"Hey, can you invest in my company?"

523
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,440
Now, I need to reach out

524
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,240
to data scientist and say,

525
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,320
"Please, I want to show you a demo

526
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:49,960
of this product.

527
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,440
I think you'll really gain

528
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,160
from using it."

529
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,360
And they just don't answer.

530
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,800
They just don't get back to me.

531
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,760
Usually they do, just kidding.

532
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,200
I'll tell you, about 20%

533
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,640
of the times they do.

534
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,920
So, that's a lot of fun.

535
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,800
And, you know,

536
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,720
closing a customer,

537
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,880
paying customer,

538
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,240
which is a lot for seed stage startup,

539
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,800
it's like the thrill

540
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,320
and the rush that you get

541
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,160
from something like that is amazing.

542
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,400
And I'm really enjoying myself.

543
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,160
So, it's a great experience.

544
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,080
And I can't even imagine.

545
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,560
What are some

546
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,040
of the most meaningful things

547
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,880
that you're taking with you back to F2

548
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,920
from these few months at Superwise?

549
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,000
Because you're mentioning

550
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,680
that you went through

551
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,000
the self reflective journey

552
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,440
where you're thinking about

553
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,280
what type of skills

554
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,480
or what ever experience that you need

555
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,840
in order to be successful investor

556
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,280
in your mind.

557
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,360
And it sounds to me like you've had

558
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,920
a pretty impactful experience

559
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,680
with Supewise.

560
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,880
I'd love to hear some of those

561
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,720
you know, insights

562
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,680
that you've gained along the way.

563
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,320
Sure.

564
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,280
So, I think, the first thing is hustle.

565
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,800
So, you sit on the board,

566
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,972
I'm talking with your startup,

567
00:15:56,973 --> 00:15:58,801
and you're trying to understand

568
00:15:59,001 --> 00:15:59,800
what the processes

569
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,680
and the sales machine, the KPIs.

570
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,840
And sometimes as,

571
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,621
if I look at myself

572
00:16:06,622 --> 00:16:08,006
as a future board member,

573
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:09,280
I would understand

574
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,520
that you have to hustle, okay?

575
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,480
You need to do whatever it takes

576
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,200
to get to the next milestone.

577
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,120
You don't have to do things

578
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,920
that are scalable,

579
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,240
I'm not talking about product or technology,

580
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,280
I'm talking more on sales and growth.

581
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:20,560
Okay?

582
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,920
And to use your connections

583
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,520
and to reach out to people,

584
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,800
you need to do whatever it takes

585
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,760
to score these customers.

586
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,480
And only after you experience

587
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,080
onboarding a few customers,

588
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,360
then you can really sit down

589
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,480
and analyze what you did

590
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,360
the right way,

591
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,560
where you made mistakes,

592
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,120
and then also kind of build

593
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,760
the segmentation of the customers

594
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,520
and how to approach each of them,

595
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,160
and slowly but surely,

596
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,600
then you start building

597
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,800
that marketing sales machine.

598
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,680
So, that's the one thing.

599
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,160
The second thing is measure everything.

600
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,920
Measure everything.

601
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,640
Because there are so many insights

602
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,560
inside those numbers

603
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,200
that will really change your perspective

604
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,840
on how to sell, who to sell to,

605
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,320
A/B testing.

606
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,160
I think sometimes you underestimate them.

607
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,240
You say, "I don't have time for this."

608
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,920
And it's a bit slow at the beginning.

609
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,440
But I think that if you invest

610
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,320
in the infrastructure

611
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,920
of measuring things,

612
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,400
that's a great investment

613
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,680
for the long run

614
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,360
and for the future

615
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,920
and for scaling.

616
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,760
So, those are my two main takeaways.

617
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
And I will definitely recommend that

618
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,320
to any of our companies going forward.

619
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,120
I love that.

620
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,320
Biggest tips for pre-seed companies,

621
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,560
for example, that are coming to F2.

622
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,680
Because you really get a chance

623
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,400
to both seed companies, you know,

624
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,320
in their early, early days

625
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,360
and then in the early days of seed.

626
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:44,880
Right?

627
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,200
So, what are some tips

628
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,680
more for the pre-seed?

629
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,160
Because it's very great to be able to talk

630
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,360
to somebody investing

631
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
in pre-seed companies

632
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,600
and seeing a lot of them

633
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,200
and then seeing some of the journey

634
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,800
that they go through.

635
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,880
So, perhaps, what are some

636
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,200
of the most meaningful things

637
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,800
that a group of people

638
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,040
can undergo between the pre-seed and seed

639
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,720
that you have been experiencing now

640
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,720
and you can sort of tell them in advance,

641
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,040
by the way, watch out this

642
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,120
this is going to be important?

643
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,760
Sure. I think,

644
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,480
being in love with your idea

645
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,640
is a challenge

646
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,000
that many companies have.

647
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,440
And when you raise pre-seed,

648
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,320
you need to understand

649
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
that you have to be very flexible.

650
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,200
And inputs from the market,

651
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,840
and this friction with customers

652
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,680
is super valuable

653
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,000
and you have to take it into consideration.

654
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,320
Because you might be directed

655
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,040
in totally different direction.

656
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,600
And I think investors,

657
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,080
when you reach the seed round

658
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,320
and you pitch them an idea,

659
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,640
if you can say,

660
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,600
I sold out with this idea

661
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,480
and now I'm pitching this idea.

662
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,720
And this is what I learned

663
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,960
during the past three, four months.

664
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,440
These are the insights

665
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,760
I have on the market.

666
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,800
And that's why I pivoted

667
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,080
and I chose to go for this product

668
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,920
and this solution.

669
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,800
As an investor, I'll be like,

670
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,680
"Wow, okay.

671
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,040
He actually studied the market."

672
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,480
Wasn't happy with his idea,

673
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,840
which means he's coachable and flexible

674
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,480
and he is able to kind of productize

675
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,600
the feedback from the customers.

676
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,160
For me, that's a very positive signal

677
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,600
as an investor.

678
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,300
It sounds amazing.

679
00:19:19,301 --> 00:19:20,440
Tal, I want to thank you

680
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,680
for being so generous with your time.

681
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,800
20 minutes go by fast

682
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,680
but I know that there is so much more

683
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,480
that I wanted to talk about,

684
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,760
whether it's the Junction, F2,

685
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,080
where you're headed next.

686
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,760
But it sounds like

687
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,200
it's a phenomenal journey.

688
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,680
And very similar to you,

689
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,720
I think that I'm on

690
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,560
a pretty similar path

691
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,800
of trying to understand

692
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,640
what does it take to make an impact,

693
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,920
whether it's in investing, as a startup,

694
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,280
as a learner, as anything.

695
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,120
And it sounds like

696
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,080
these different experiences

697
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,240
are invaluable.

698
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,280
And I'm definitely taking

699
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,280
a lot from this conversation.

700
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,360
So, thank you.

701
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,200
But before we leave,

702
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,800
I have to ask you

703
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,040
for the most important question,

704
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,280
which is three words

705
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,920
that you would use to describe yourself.

706
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,320
Sure.

707
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,000
So, I think the first word

708
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,560
would be loyal.

709
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,520
Something that I think

710
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,000
one of the values

711
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,080
that I grew up upon,

712
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,400
being loyal to family and friends.

713
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,040
And I know that people that I love,

714
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,200
I'll do anything for them.

715
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,080
And I think that also

716
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:22,000
it reflects in how I work with the companies

717
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,600
and how I work at F2.

718
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,560
And in Hebrew, it says "takkana shema".

719
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,080
So, I think that's part

720
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,080
of really being loyal.

721
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,520
The second word would be proactive.

722
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,400
I think that you make

723
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,800
your own luck

724
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,200
and you have to be proactive

725
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,880
and just be out there,

726
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,160
expose yourself, be vulnerable.

727
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,240
It's okay.

728
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,160
I think you can only gain

729
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,960
from doing that.

730
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,440
And the third would be hustle.

731
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,760
I hustled my way into F2.

732
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,040
I hustle to source leads at F2.

733
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,480
I hustle at Superwise to reach these

734
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,800
head of data science

735
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,400
and the machine learning.

736
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,080
And it's all about the hustle.

737
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,120
So, just do hard work and hustle

738
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,080
and do whatever it takes.

739
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,120
So, those are the three words on my mind.

740
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,360
Tal, thank you very, very much.

741
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:17,960
This is great.

742
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,520
And stay safe and stay healthy.

743
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,720
Cheers. Thanks for having me.

744
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,800
Have a good one.

745
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,240
Of course.
