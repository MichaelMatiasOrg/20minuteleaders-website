1 I don't think we live in a world anymore where there is one path to drive successful life. Entrepreneurs come from all shapes and walks of life. And we see that daily with companies that thrive and companies that, you know, perish. Shahar Erez, thank you for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? I'm doing well. How are you, Michael? Good morning. I'm doing wonderful. Thank you very much. Let's talk about Talent. Let's talk about the workplace, talent, data driven talent acquisition and hybrid models. Because what you're doing with Stoke Talent is fascinating. But right before we get there, let's go back to you journey just a little bit. From the Technion and finishing 12 years of studies getting your high school diploma at the age of 22. You will not really think that a 22 year old graduate will end up being a successful tech veteran? What is that about? Neither did my parents. They were pretty concerned when I graduated high school without a diploma. But you know, during high school my mind was at a different place. I didn't enjoy studying. Although I was registered to study physics and computers, it's kind of a great class considered but my mind was elsewhere. I was already thinking about going to the military service. And so, I actually didn't wake up to my final math test in high school. And so I never, Wow. I never officially graduated. I did almost five years in the military, various roles. And when I left, I think I was already a little more mature and understood that if I want to do something with my life, I better complete that. By the way, the day that I left the military, I remember my parents calling me like, "If you want to double think that when you don't, you won't get any job outside. Why don't you stick in the military?" And so, I did leave the military. I completed my high school diploma. I did my math, physics exams. And went and did my psychometric exam. I guess it's the equivalent of an SAT. I got a pretty good score. Kind of, you know, combined with my military service, paved the way to get a full three year scholarship for computer science. Although I never wanted to study computer science, I thought it was going to be boring. But somehow I got a full three year scholarship. And that's how I got into computer science. One thing led to the other. And I was never a great engineer. I never thought I will be a great engineer but it gave me, you know, it gave me insights into this entire, back then you know, high tech industry, what does it mean. And there's more than just coding. There's an entire ecosystem around it. Got to work with a lot of people, startup companies, large companies. How business get built around software, the various elements that are required. How do you build a product. How do you go sell a product. How you market a product. And so, I was fortunate to work from my perspective with the best of the best you know, joint companies like Mercury Interactive. I was mentored by leaders, probably the best leaders in the industry. People like [--], Amnon Landan. Then in VMware, with people like Paul Maritz. I was really had the opportunity to learn from these people. How to think about business, how to think about leading people, what should you focus on, what should you give up on, what to insist and you know. Shahar, would you do anything differently? If you were to go back to high school, middle school, would you do anything differently? You know, I'm not sure. Yes, you might say I wasted some time. But I don't think anything could have been different. Some things need to happen in their own pace. The only thing I regret is I never graduated quite cool. Other than that I don't really care about anything else. My kids now, I have three kids now, all in their teens. And although school is important, we never really look at their grades. I don't really make it a thing. I think that there's so much more at driving successful happy life than you know, how much you scored on your English, math or whatever exam. I think that, I'm living testimony to someone that flunked math in school. And, you know, my parents were called in to school multiple times. It just took some time for me to get settled in and, you know, to find my way. And I think that the most important thing is to find how should I say it, find your passion, be a good person. And beyond that, I mean, there's multiple things that need to be done. I don't think we live in a world anymore where there is one path to drive successful life. Entrepreneurs come from all shapes and walks of life. And we see that daily with companies that thrive and companies that, you know, perish. And there's no one path for that. It's not that you have to go to these schools and you have to study these things and you have to take this track. It's mostly about the person you are. The interaction that you are able to create with others. Your ability to think outside the box. I think that a lot of these things are not things that you acquire in traditional education. But you acquire them through different experiences in life. Which, by the way, would lead to some of my observation around where the talent market is heading. A lot of who I am today is an outcome. That is going to be my next question. Obviously, it's not because of what I've studied at school, but it's because of the experiences I had both in school and then in my military service with the people I had the opportunity to interact with. And then being fortunate to work for the company with the people I worked with and how much I was open to learn from them, to get feedback, to do better at what I do. And it's not specifically about getting this grade or that grade. It's one of the things you study in Israeli air force is, it doesn't matter how successful your last flight was. It's like, can you come off that flight, spend time to research what was wrong. Research what went well, keep what went well and fix what went wrong for your next flight. And then on an ongoing basis, how do you create ongoing improvement. You know, I think without applying the specific approach on a day to day basis, this was the mentality that I've absorbed over the last 20 years. Sometimes I succeeded to what I did. And a lot of times I failed. I've built products that didn't succeed. I've built products that were extremely successful, but what can you learn from it. Right. I think one of the things that I was always so hugely impressed doing during my service and I was always looking at the Air Force debriefing methodology that you were referring to. And I think that it's been quoted countless times by Eric Schmidt and [--] and others, they were talking about this behavior mechanism where it doesn't matter if you succeeded or failed, there's always something to learn from this experience. And unless you're very intentional with the way that you debrief this experience, you can let the lessons just fly by you and then it's worthless because you didn't learn anything, right? Then where's the compounding learning along your life. And I agree. It's so important there and it's the debrief. And one of the most important things with that debrief is, how do you debrief leaving your ego aside. Because we have this internal defensive mechanism. It's like, it wasn't me, something else went wrong. Right. And I met at some point it wasn't in my unit, but one of the elite units in the military. And a friend there kind of told me, It's the first thing you do in debrief. It's like you go up on stage and say, "I failed, I was wrong." Once you do that, you come with that approach, then your egos aside, and then you learn and evolve. And I try to apply that. And then moving on, it's like 15 years later, I heard Paul Maritz back at VMware which is one of the nicest person, one of the smartest person people that I know and he said, "How do you grow up as a leader not spending every minute at work trying to be the smartest person in the room? How do you leave that aside?" It's like it doesn't matter who's right, who's wrong. How do you end a conversation in a different manner? And I think, some of it has to do with maturity. Some of it has to do with obviously attitude and DNA. But once you rise to that level of not really putting yourself at the center but you're just a piece of that puzzle, a lot of things inside and around you start moving a lot better. And I think that that's very, very smart. And I'm definitely taking that to heart. Shahar, tell me a little bit about your insights into the talent space. What is the talent space to start with? Because I don't meet many entrepreneurs that are working in that space. Yeah. So, I'll tell you, my, obviously my POV. So, you know, I spent 20 years almost in the industry leading teams. Hundreds of people in some of those phases. And the one thing that you see along the line is the one thing that I think distinguishes super successful companies with a less successful companies is their ability to deploy the right talent, at the right project at the right time to produce the right results. And what I've seen, and I work for large corporates and small companies is that it's very difficult to navigate this talent pool because the resources that you need are not the resources that you have. And then you start doing you know, all this maneuvering instead of fitting the business, fitting your existing talent pool. Back in 2013, when I moved back to Israel from California, I started my own company and we bootstrapped because we can't raise any money. And we started using online marketplaces. It was early days for Fiverr. oDesk was still the leading platform, I think. We started getting exposure to different online marketplace where you can find talent. After a bit of trial and error, because it gets time to get adjusted to these, we found tremendous value in online platform. Because all of a sudden if I need something, I have someone working on it the next day. Maybe they're not perfect for it. But if I had to go and recruit for somebody to do that job, I'd be waiting three months. Or we get something 70% of the quality, but starts working on it within 48 hours. And that kind of change, Even less. Yeah, even less. It depends what you need. Right? If you need a a piece of code and sometimes you need to qualify them and so forth. But you kind of change your entire month. So, we built a company that started getting traction. At some point we decided to drop it. But it wasn't because we weren't able to execute. At some point we had 18 people working for us all the way from New York, Rochester. All the way to India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, all over the world. We had 18 people working for us from design to coding. And we found that the ability to execute grows exponentially when you adopt that approach. Further on, I joined back into the corporate life and try to apply that approach into corporate, didn't work. Corporates work on a different stages, different processes. And I found that to be a disabler for companies to get to their full potential. And we kind of said, "What if we can connect this world of infinite talent pools?" Because really, there's hundreds of millions highly qualified people around the world wanting to freelance. On the other hand, there is a need for talent, how do we connect the two together, not through the traditional marketplace that exists right now which is more of a consumer based swipe your credit card, get someone to do work, but really in a robust manner for what corporates need to do. So, we embarked on this journey to say, what if we built an enterprise grade mechanism that helps companies A, take control over their existing freelancers and contractors; and B, augment their existing execution processes with external freelancers. The biggest challenge that we saw out there was the internal organizational processes for companies, unlike consumers, require a different process. Because, you know, Michael, if you need someone to do slides for you or get a video for you or swipe your credit card on Fiverr, someone will do that for you. If you want to do that, we need Hippo, for example, do you have the budget? Do you have the permissions? Do you know which paperwork these freelancers need to sign? Can you assure that IP will be owned by Hippo at the end of the process? There's a set of questions that come with it that the company has to comply with to be able to take that value. The best example I can give is, think about Amazon 12 years ago. You're young, you're far younger than I am. So, I don't know where you were when Amazon emerged back in 2007, give or take 2008. But when Amazon started, up until that point, if you wanted to build an application at a company you needed to get servers. To get a server, you need to go to IT. IT sent you back to finance to get budget approval and then you went back to IT that gave you the spec that they can support, then you went and submitted the purchase order. Six weeks later, you had a server and you could start coding. The day after Amazon emerged, if you wanted to build an application, all you do is click a few buttons. What has changed in the process? You know, I think that actually that exact different you know, I experienced that being in the 8200 units where, you know, it's on prime and it's still, it's not there but we have to do it and then a day after, you know, getting out of it, all of a sudden you have everything in the click of a button. So, that mental shock, what you've experienced, I think over 12 years, I've experienced in one day. But I think that's just the nature of the different talents. I agree. And if you think about it, the biggest difference, I mean, it's not that Amazon is far cheaper. But there's two significant differences. Number one, everything that you do on Amazon is fully tracked, sort of digitized. You click a button, you bought the service, someone sees it, someone can monitor it. Someone can come to you and say, "Hey, Michael, did you buy this service?" Everything is fully visible. Nothing goes hidden. Everything that you bought today, you can decide if you don't need tomorrow you return it. The same thing is now happening in the world with talent. If you need someone to help you, I know what part of Hippo you're working on, if you need someone an expert in NLP tomorrow to help you solve a problem, you can and go find someone to help you solve that NLP problem. It's going to cost you a few hundred dollars. It's going to accelerate your work by three or four days, and then you let him go. It's the same exact thought process. Everything is managed. Just like but like you're mentioning, there is a whole added layer of complexity because it's not just the expertise, but there's compliance issues with the data that we're working with. And there is, you know, a lot of it is based around the privacy and the intellectual property of the company. And I'm assuming that with an example like you're giving, if you're requesting the aid of an expert ad hoc, then this is probably dealing with some sensitive data or some core business that you really need to dig deep. And therefore, you also need to be extra careful with who you are submitting the information. That's a great comment. And this is exactly where Stoke comes in. Part of what Stoke built, because we're optimized for these corporates and companies, is to help the company set their policy. Who's allowed to be freelancer in the company, what people do you need this time, which states can they come from, what validation and background check will the platform run on them before they get started, all of that in a fully automated manner. Another example I can give you is think about when you're traveling between Stanford and Tel Aviv and wherever it is you're going, and if you're going on a private trip you're booking your flight through an Expedia or Booking or whatever platform you're using for your personal travel. If you're booking at trip for Hippo, you're probably doing it using a Trip actions, or that sort. The difference is at the end of the day, everyone's boarding the same flight. But the internal controls, mechanisms, validations, policies, budgeting, all of that is different between a personal trip and a corporate trip. And this is where the corporate element of handling talents and freelancer is the layer that Stoke has built. To make sure that everyone's working for the company is valid. Everyone is legal, now with AB5 or Prop 22 in California make sure that they can actually be paid as independent contractor. Making sure they signed the right IP, documents. or you own your IP at the end of the process. Make sure they got paid on time so you're not violating payment legislation. This is exactly the layer that we add. So, if you or anyone else in the company needs to get extra help or resources, they don't have to go through legal, finance, HR, procurement and wait for months before they can actually get going. How do you actually create that marketplace where, because it sounds like the onboarding for these contractors, you can call them as well as the companies, is not a one click, right? I mean, you have to vet the person. You have to make sure that they have compliance with all of the taxes and all the payment methods. And you also have to make sure that they're also sending the right IP contract. So, it does sound complicated. How do you simplify the process for both the contractor and the company that contracts? Great question. There's two sides. A, we're not trying to become a marketplace ourselves. I'm not pooling the talents myself. Most of the companies, we work with startup by bringing on their own talent to the platform, the freelancers that they're working with right now just to make sure that they are complying with legislation. And if the companies look for additional resources, then we're actually partnering with the set of marketplace. There's about six or 700 marketplaces now. HBS just released a paper. There's over seven hundred marketplaces. Some of them are generic like UpWork, Freelancer.com, Fiverr. Some of them are more specific or verticalized. From our standpoint, we're not taking a dime off a freelancer. So, for us we're okay working with anyone in a marketplace in partnership. When someone is searching for talent, we'll go search it from multiple marketplaces. And when the connection is done between the company and the freelancer we'll make sure that we vet the freelancer, we make them signed the right paperwork, everything is happening automatically through the platform. So, the work will not start before all that background check is done. That makes a lot of sense. I'd love to spend the last few minutes that we have talking a little bit about your observation on the talent industry as covid hit. So, everybody's talking about working remotely. You know, we hear that sentence every other day. But I'm curious to hear with your outlook on the hybrid model. And not just onboarding employees during covid but also onboarding freelancers. And I'm assuming intuitively that there has been an increase in usage of freelancers. And I'm guessing that a lot of companies are realizing that, okay, if I'm finding people online, maybe I don't have to find the person that's sitting in the next street. Maybe I can just hire the person that is 1,000 kilometers away but is a little bit cheaper or has a different skill set. So, what has happened to your industry as a result? So, first of all, the trend was there way before covid started. There was a report from 2018 in the United States, over 2500 companies without offices in 2018. So, this is not new. This remote thing didn't start with covid. What covid, and if you look at the reports from the IRS and Bureau of Labor Statistics, the projection was that by 2025, 50% of the workforce in the US will be freelancing. And by 2030, 60%. So, the trajectory is there. This is way before covid. Wow. What covid has done is accelerated a five year process into five months. And all the indications that we're seeing by public companies like Fiverr and Upwork, by Gartner, McKinsey, Deloitte, CNBC and Harvard now is that we're seeing 20 to 30%, depends on who you're quoting, growth in the number of freelancers by these companies. There's too many grounds here. Number one is in set. Everyone's remote. So, does it matter if I get someone to work remote for me on payroll or as a freelancer? Obviously, there's a lot of benefit in working as a freelancer. It doesn't matter if they're on payroll or not. Add to that effect, generational shift. Most of Generation Z and a portion of Millennials prefer to be freelancers not be tied to a single employer. Then there's a match of expectation. Companies prefer the flexibility. Individuals prefer the flexibility because no one expects job security anymore anyway. So, why not have that flexibility. And the last thing is that companies are realizing that it's super complicated to run any projection. They don't know how they're, what is going to happen next year. So, getting into commitment with full time employees versus keeping flexibility in a world of changing skill sets, there is expectation that skill sets will change every two to three years. And so, do I really need to spend now getting people on board that will be with me in four to five years? Maybe it's not the right thing for the company anymore. We're seeing average time tech employees spend at the companies has dropped one point nine years. Just under two years, if you think about it. That's the average time someone sticks to a company. So, why not build a flexible workforce that has 60, 70% of its employees as full time employees, and the other 30 to 40% keeps changing on an ongoing basis. Every research shows, freelancers are more up to date with changes in the industry. They're more passionate about what they do. They execute faster. And they on board three times faster compared to traditional employees. Because they're doing it constantly. So, if that's the case, then go on freelancers. Start working with them. If they're great at what they do, try to convince them to become full time employees. And if they don't, get someone else. I think that that's an amazing way to end. And I'm convinced. So, Shahar, thank you very, very much for this time. Thank you for teaching a little bit more than a lot more than I knew about about this industry. And I think the way you're doing at Stoke Talent makes perfect sense to me. Especially with the trajectories of where we're going. And covid-19, as you said, it just accelerated it. The trend was already there. I've been actually using oDesk since 2013. When I had my high school startup, we had almost 50 people in India and Pakistan that were working ad hoc on all these various tasks because we were four high schoolers and we needed more support. And we didn't even know how to get real employees. But it was very easy to swipe a credit card and pay somebody from oDesk. I wish we had Stoke back then. So, if my co-founders are listening to this, they know exactly what I'm talking about. Shahar, before we leave, I have to ask you for three words that you would use to describe yourself. I'd start with assertive, empathetic, and visionary. Although it sounds like, you know, I'm a bit exaggerating about myself. But that's how I usually approach things. I look at the long term. I love that. And it comes definitely across in this conversation that a lot of it is long term thinking. And I love that. But if I had to say one thing again as a tip for others, it's like empathy is keys. Like, it doesn't matter what you do and how you trying to build it. And you're working for Hippo. And Assaf is a great example of beyond being the visionary and the leader. And he's one of the smartest people I know. It's like the first thing is to be a mensch. In Yiddish, a mensch is like be a decent person, be a kind person. Everything else is [--]. I'm very excited to send this to him now. Shahar, toda raba. Thank you very, very much. And stay safe and stay healthy.
