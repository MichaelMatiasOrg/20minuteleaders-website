1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
The last piece that clicked was,

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,440
okay, there's something big here,

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,680
I love this industry.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,280
There's an ability to really make

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,200
a difference for small businesses.

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,720
And then it was like, you know what,

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,080
this needs to be you doing it.

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,560
It can't be somebody else

9
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,800
executing on your vision.

10
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,500
You need to do it.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,120
Eyal Liftshitz, thank you for joining me

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,360
all the way from California.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,600
How are you?

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,040
I'm great.

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,960
Thanks for having me, Michael.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,480
Of course. I'm both jealous

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,160
and not jealous of you.

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,680
I can't wait to come back

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,360
and live in Silicon Valley.

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,840
It's such a wonderful place.

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,760
But, you know, it's an interesting time

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,440
where we are now.

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,640
So, I'll hopefully we'll get

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,880
to meet in person in a few months.

25
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,800
But for now, I'll get to hear all about

26
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,480
your journey all the way from Israel

27
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,360
and Chicago Booth to Greylock,

28
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,960
McKinsey and now, BlueVine.

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,280
So, Eyal, first walk me back

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,080
all the way to your pizza delivery days.

31
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,080
What is that all about?

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,800
I think, well, I started by,

33
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,120
my first job was delivering pizzas, okay.

34
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,240
And I think this is

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,800
highlighting the fact that,

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,480
you know, I didn't start

37
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,360
my career in tech.

38
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,440
And even furthermore, you know,

39
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,920
kind of a funny or an anecdote here,

40
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,080
I did not own a computer

41
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,080
before I was around 22.

42
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,640
Really.

43
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,560
So, yes, I was a carefree teenager.

44
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,800
I served,

45
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,960
I didn't really care about technology.

46
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,800
In the military, I served in infantry.

47
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,560
I did not go to 8200 or 8100.

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,080
I basically, decided to go

49
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,920
and pursue a technology career

50
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,480
back in, it was 2000

51
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,520
when I started my degree

52
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,080
in electrical engineering.

53
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,280
And it was due to a choice that

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,120
I really didn't know

55
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,240
what I wanted to do in life at the time.

56
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,040
And high tech seemed

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,640
like a good opportunity.

58
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,880
You know, tech was booming

59
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,000
in the year 2000.

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,400
I didn't have a lot of sense

61
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,240
of what that means.

62
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,680
But you know what?

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,600
People are making good money

64
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,400
in technology,

65
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
why don't I go into high tech.

66
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,360
And the pizza delivery story

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,960
connect to that,

68
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,840
I think a little bit, even comically.

69
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,320
I used to deliver pizzas,

70
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,400
I lived in Ramat Aviv at the time,

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,560
and I delivered pizzas

72
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,480
in a pizzeria in Ramat Aviv.

73
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,480
And I used to deliver a lot to

74
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,720
like the tech companies

75
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,000
in Atidim and other places.

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,480
And I asked him, like,

77
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,360
"What are you guys doing?"

78
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,000
They were like,

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,320
"Well, we're engineers."

80
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,680
So, I was like, okay,

81
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,880
I need to go and do this job.

82
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,320
This is a good job, you know,

83
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,800
getting the pizza delivered to you

84
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,000
versus delivery.

85
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,840
So, that was the start of my you know,

86
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,920
my pizza delivery days is kind of like

87
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,320
grounded me into tech.

88
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,960
I love it.

89
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,040
Was it Pizza Fino by any chance?

90
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,120
It was Pizza Fino.

91
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,600
It is my all time favorite pizza.

92
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,640
I'm from Ramat Aviv as well,

93
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,400
and I used to eat there

94
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,120
almost on a daily basis.

95
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,200
So, we already have

96
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,400
a huge thing in common.

97
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,560
And I'm hugely appreciative

98
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,240
even more than what you do at BlueVine,

99
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,920
I think what you did with Pizza Fino

100
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,880
tops that much more so.

101
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,840
So, thank you for that.

102
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,920
But you're actually,

103
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,240
your entrepreneurial experience

104
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,280
goes beyond just the pizzas

105
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,520
and then your understanding to transition

106
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,720
to a different industry.

107
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,280
Your family, you say

108
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,880
you're a third generation

109
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,080
entrepreneur. Right?

110
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,720
So, talk to me a little bit about that

111
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,680
and how that runs in the family.

112
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,920
It's an interesting story here.

113
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,840
And I don't know

114
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,320
if it runs in the family.

115
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,760
And I'll explain further on that.

116
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,880
My dad was a small business owner.

117
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,400
He had a physical therapy clinic

118
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,640
in the Upper East Side

119
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,000
of New York for 30 years.

120
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,040
His dad owned a

121
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,200
kind of lighting electricity lighting

122
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,840
store in Dizingof for 40 years.

123
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,640
So, both of them were

124
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,600
small business owners.

125
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,040
And you know,

126
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,360
the reason why small

127
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,400
business owners start their business is

128
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,560
many of them don't want a boss.

129
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,600
And they want to be able to run, you know,

130
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,800
their own kind of thing and do their own,

131
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,280
you know, run their own show.

132
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,320
And so, I view small business owners

133
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,480
as entrepreneurs by their own right.

134
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,640
They start their company,

135
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,320
or their business or their whatever.

136
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
And they share

137
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,280
many of the same things

138
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,720
that we do in startup land

139
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,560
when we start a company.

140
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,080
There's many of the same pain points,

141
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,960
you need to figure out

142
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,240
your business plan,

143
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,760
your hiring, how to generate revenue.

144
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,520
Of course, it's a different outcome.

145
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,000
And they're not looking to build

146
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,520
a billion dollar companies.

147
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,760
But there's a lot of the same stuff,

148
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,480
especially when they start out.

149
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,320
Right.

150
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,440
You know, in terms of running

151
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,200
in the family, I don't know

152
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,360
if it runs in the family.

153
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,400
I didn't know that I wanted to be

154
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,880
an entrepreneur

155
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,400
up until I started BlueVine.

156
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,880
If you look at my career, you know,

157
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,120
it's a pretty safe journey.

158
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,000
I kind of stuck to larger companies,

159
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,080
pretty strong brand names.

160
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,440
I didn't really take any risk

161
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,520
before I started BlueVine.

162
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,880
There are some people that

163
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,680
they graduate from college and they know

164
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,720
that their destiny is to start a company.

165
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,120
They know they want to be

166
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,240
an entrepreneur.

167
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,840
I did not have that.

168
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,560
Interesting.

169
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,720
I wasn't that.

170
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,040
I very much followed a safe path.

171
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,000
And the reason I started BlueVine

172
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,960
was less so about the personal interest

173
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,000
or the draw to actually become a founder,

174
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
but rather

175
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
the opportunity and the calling.

176
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,560
You know, even further adding to that

177
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,360
in the beginning,

178
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,080
the mindset working in venture capital

179
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,960
and seeing the opportunity

180
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,200
to start BlueVine I was like,

181
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,640
why don't we find a CEO to do this.

182
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,320
When do we found

183
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,480
somebody else to do this.

184
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,040
I wasn't thinking that this would be me.

185
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,360
But I got so consumed with the idea

186
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,920
and the opportunity that at some point,

187
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,680
you know, this is mine,

188
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,840
I need to really go do this.

189
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,480
So, walk me through

190
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,360
that thinking process.

191
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,040
Because you're a principal at Greylock,

192
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,200
one of the best investment groups

193
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,560
in the world based in your,

194
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,840
in the cohort based in Israel.

195
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,320
You're thinking about this industry.

196
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,960
You're thinking about

197
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,760
small business owners.

198
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,200
Obviously, this has a connection to you

199
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,080
coming from a family

200
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,000
of small business owners

201
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,600
and you're understanding

202
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,200
that there is a gap in the market,

203
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,040
an opportunity that at the end you decide

204
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,960
to go and fulfill it

205
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,520
yourself with BlueVine.

206
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,680
What are those weeks, days, months like?

207
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,360
What does that process look like

208
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,160
for a safe journeyed

209
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,680
you know, technology guy and

210
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,080
somebody who is working in tech,

211
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,560
working in fantastic beginnings,

212
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,880
McKinsey, Greylock.

213
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,840
And you're saying, you know what,

214
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,640
I'm ready to go start my own journey.

215
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,320
What is that thinking

216
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,040
process like for you?

217
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,720
It was an evolution.

218
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,560
So first, when you work in venture,

219
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,240
you get exposed

220
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,360
to entrepreneurship in general.

221
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,840
You worked with a lot of founders.

222
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,400
You assess investments.

223
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,280
And, you know, entrepreneurship

224
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,720
is somewhat infectious.

225
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,000
You see the excitement of people

226
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,480
starting something from nothing.

227
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,040
You kind of follow their journey

228
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,800
from the outside in.

229
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,400
And, you know,

230
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,280
there's a lot of excitement

231
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,200
that rubs off.

232
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,880
So first, being in venture

233
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,080
did move me closer in that direction.

234
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,040
The story of BlueVine at the beginning

235
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,520
was more of an analytical exercise.

236
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,080
I had an opportunity to look

237
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,280
and see a lot of companies

238
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,840
in the fintech space

239
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,280
through Greylock Israel.

240
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,320
And there were heavy investors

241
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,640
in fintech at the time.

242
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,320
And I realized

243
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,240
that there's an opportunity,

244
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
there's a white space,

245
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,240
specifically at the time when we started

246
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,560
the company and factoring.

247
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,880
And I was a big fan

248
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,680
of what was happening

249
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
in online financing,

250
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,640
and I realized there were

251
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,360
still areas of opportunities.

252
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,320
And so, when I learned

253
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,720
about factoring at the time,

254
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,640
it clicked that there is an ability

255
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,440
to take a page from what was being done

256
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,200
in other sort of products

257
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,440
and apply it here.

258
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
And the market sizes is quite large.

259
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,080
And so that from an analytical

260
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,400
from the outside in, it really connected.

261
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,200
And then there was

262
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,640
a personal passion always to

263
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,280
evaluate and see opportunities

264
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,200
within small businesses.

265
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,080
And this does relate

266
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,200
to my personal background.

267
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,280
I did grow up

268
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,160
around my father's business.

269
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,920
I heard about him talking about

270
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,880
growing up with his father's business,

271
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,920
around his father's business.

272
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,000
It's something that was always around me.

273
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,440
I had a connection to this segment.

274
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,920
And so those two things came together

275
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,200
in terms of,

276
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,520
wow, there is really something here.

277
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:16,880
And the last piece that clicked was,

278
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,600
okay, there's something big here.

279
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,880
I love this industry.

280
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,480
There's an ability to really make

281
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,360
a difference for small businesses.

282
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,920
And then it was like, you know what,

283
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,280
this needs to be you doing it.

284
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,760
It can't be somebody else

285
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,000
executing on your vision.

286
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,200
You need to do it.

287
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,240
And, you know,

288
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,520
while I was 35 at the time,

289
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,880
I did not want to be an entrepreneur

290
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,560
until that point in my life.

291
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,960
At that point, sort of like the regret

292
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,000
minimization framework kicked in.

293
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,920
It was like, if I don't do this,

294
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,160
I'm going to regret it

295
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,080
20 years in the future.

296
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,080
So, I jumped in.

297
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,640
So, do you categorize yourself

298
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,680
as a full time entrepreneur?

299
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,280
I categorize myself

300
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
as a full time founder.

301
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,840
Yes, a full time entrepreneur.

302
00:08:58,841 --> 00:08:59,760
You know, I think

303
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:01,640
when you start a company, the definition

304
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,680
of entrepreneur versus CEO,

305
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,240
they get kind of

306
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,560
mixed over the life of a company.

307
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,760
Right.

308
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,120
I think I'm becoming more and more

309
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,720
of a CEO as time goes by

310
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,320
and the company becomes larger.

311
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,280
Of course, I'm a founder CEO.

312
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,400
So, that is something that is

313
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,840
always part of my sort of outlook.

314
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,240
But as time goes by,

315
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,920
as you take more of the role of the CEO

316
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,440
and your role in the company rather

317
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,960
than just being the founder.

318
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,200
Sure. Can you share a little bit more about

319
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,960
about the industry

320
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,600
and the market of small businesses?

321
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,640
What's happening today,

322
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
especially in the United States

323
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,560
that you're observing?

324
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,400
How do you even get to that

325
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,680
that big pain point that you've observed?

326
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,440
And what is the trend look like

327
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,840
as we are now in 2021, I guess?

328
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,360
So, I will say that the vision

329
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,160
of the company evolved significantly

330
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,920
from when we started.

331
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,160
We started with a very narrow

332
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,080
product set,

333
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,520
answering, factoring

334
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,040
and making that an online product

335
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,920
then evolved to providing a full range

336
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,680
of printed products.

337
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,320
And today, we really involved

338
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,480
in delivering end to end banking.

339
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,480
And so, it wasn't,

340
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,000
there wasn't any pivot along the way.

341
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,920
This was a continued expansion

342
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,560
of the business model and strategy.

343
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,320
So, you're considering it

344
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,400
as an evolvement,

345
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
as an evolvement of that narrow idea

346
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,240
that you've understood, okay,

347
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,280
there's actually a bigger gap

348
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,040
than what we thought.

349
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,680
Yes.

350
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,200
Yes.

351
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,160
You know, there was an entry point here,

352
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,720
but over time, realizing that

353
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,840
the real opportunity is to essentially

354
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,440
fix small business banking as a whole

355
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,960
and factoring is part of credit

356
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,600
and credit is part of banking.

357
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,640
And banking as a whole,

358
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,840
is broken for small businesses.

359
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,920
And that is the true opportunity

360
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,200
that we're looking to solve,

361
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,640
which includes everything that belongs

362
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,280
under making checking accounts,

363
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,600
credit, payments, everything else.

364
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,920
This has been sort of an evolution

365
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,640
that happened through

366
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,680
understanding our customers

367
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,920
and their pain points.

368
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,400
Now, when you

369
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,880
are referring to small businesses,

370
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,720
broadly, what has been happening

371
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,680
in the last two decades, essentially,

372
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,600
they've been outsourcing

373
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,920
their financial services from their bank

374
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,080
no longer that they do most of their

375
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,600
or interact with their bank for most

376
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,720
of their financial services need.

377
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,880
They still hold their checking account

378
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,720
with their bank.

379
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
But payment processing

380
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,560
they get from Square,

381
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,480
from PayPal, from Stripe.

382
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,040
Payments, they get from bill.com.

383
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,400
Credit, they get historically

384
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,360
from third party lenders

385
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,600
like us and others.

386
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,520
It's been a world where

387
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,680
things that you would expect to get

388
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,360
from your bank and corporations

389
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,800
definitely get from their bank.

390
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:20,240
Small businesses end up needing to rely

391
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,200
on many third party providers,

392
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
not their bank.

393
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,680
And that is not an ideal market.

394
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,920
That's not an ideal outcome.

395
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,720
The ideal outcome is

396
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,320
they can actually have a banking partner

397
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,480
that can answer all of their needs

398
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,120
under one place

399
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,040
and everything works together seamlessly.

400
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,080
And that is what we're doing.

401
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,040
Providing them access

402
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,880
to everything they need under one roof

403
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,640
and making it very easy

404
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,200
to transact digitally.

405
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,160
That's another big point.

406
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,240
And that really connects to the pandemic.

407
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,040
It's interesting. Both consumers,

408
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,600
they don't go to the branch anymore.

409
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,280
When's the last time

410
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,240
do you went to the branch?

411
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
I sometimes ask that question

412
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,040
and people tell you,

413
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,680
I actually went last week.

414
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,680
Eyal, I don't even know

415
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,640
that there are branches

416
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,480
that are still existing.

417
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,160
You're telling me a new news now.

418
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,680
I can't believe that

419
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,000
they're still operating in person.

420
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,600
They are.

421
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,000
And you know, when you look at the

422
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,560
small business segment, interestingly,

423
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,800
while consumers over time

424
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,440
have stopped going to the branches,

425
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,440
definitely the younger generations,

426
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,240
small businesses, small business owners

427
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,800
on average still go, on average,

428
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,600
at least once a week to the branch.

429
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Why?

430
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,000
Because they don't have everything

431
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,760
at their disposal

432
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,720
to be able to transact digitally.

433
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,000
You know, adding to that the pandemic,

434
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,280
that doesn't work anymore.

435
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,040
So, certainly there's a lot of like

436
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,040
tailwinds right now for providers like us

437
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,640
to be able to provide a small business

438
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,560
the ability to transact digitally

439
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,960
without needing to go to the branch.

440
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,920
Certainly right now is not a time where

441
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,640
small business value going to the branch.

442
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,560
And even before it was a hassle

443
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,320
and the time stuck.

444
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,000
Now, it's just impossible

445
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,160
and there's a health concern.

446
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,120
So, that certainly is giving us

447
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,000
an increased push for what we're doing.

448
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,360
In addition,

449
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,200
during this time when small businesses

450
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,000
have been struggling

451
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,360
and facing a lot of challenges

452
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,160
given the economic environment,

453
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,480
the banking industry has not necessarily

454
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,600
all stepped up to serving them,

455
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,840
you know, in a very robust way.

456
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,800
And so, the fact that we are 100%

457
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,760
focused on this segment

458
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,720
and are able to deliver really

459
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,480
great banking experience, I think

460
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,800
today even speaks even more loan.

461
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,760
And I think that one of the most

462
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,920
fascinating things that I love

463
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,320
about what you're doing is that

464
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,160
it's not just that you're coming in

465
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,200
and you're educating the market,

466
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,920
but you have a series of other players

467
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,440
that are coming in,

468
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,520
they're educating the market

469
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,560
on the different angles. Right.

470
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,520
So, obviously, the digital transactions

471
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,280
and the whole way that we're dealing

472
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,360
with digital assets today

473
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,440
are completely different

474
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,600
than 10, 15 years ago.

475
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,440
And having that

476
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
end to end banking solutions,

477
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,240
I'm looking at the different

478
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,080
banks here in Israel

479
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,200
and in the United States,

480
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,880
the adaptation is so slow.

481
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,880
They're still focused on

482
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,160
the different consuming habits.

483
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,920
And I think that what you're doing here

484
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,880
has impeccable timing.

485
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,400
And obviously, I can't imagine

486
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,800
in pandemic of 2020,

487
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,840
the different you know,

488
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,160
the way that you seeing your vision

489
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,200
coming together and how

490
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,120
the world has accelerated

491
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
towards this new world

492
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,800
that you're providing a solution to.

493
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,560
But Eyal, I also want to pick your brain

494
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,240
as the founder and CEO.

495
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,600
So, you're saying that you're

496
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,640
transitioning solely from being

497
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,880
the founder and the entrepreneur

498
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,360
towards now being the CEO?

499
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,840
You're the CEO of a company

500
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,480
that raised hundreds

501
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,720
of millions of dollars, right?

502
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,360
It's a big responsibility.

503
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,960
Lots of employees.

504
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,880
Now, you really are a big CEO

505
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,800
of considerably big company.

506
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,760
What are some of the thoughts shifts

507
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,120
that you've had to do as a leader

508
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,480
intrinsically, as you're transitioning

509
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,760
to your role?

510
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,600
Because your role today,

511
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,720
I am imagining is very, very different

512
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,640
from your role four or five years ago.

513
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:43,880
Right?

514
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,520
And it's been a very quick shift.

515
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,360
Yeah. I mean,

516
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,680
quick is a relative term, right?

517
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,040
It's been seven years

518
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
since we started the company.

519
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,920
And it feels like,

520
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,800
it's like startup years

521
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,320
are like gotten years, you know.

522
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,880
On one hand,

523
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,680
it feels it was just only yesterday

524
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,640
that we started the company.

525
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,760
But when I'm reflecting back

526
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,480
and everything that we went through over

527
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,240
over seven years, it's a lot.

528
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,680
It feels like a lifetime.

529
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,760
Yes, the transition is significant

530
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,120
from starting out to over time,

531
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,200
it doesn't happen in one day.

532
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,840
In the beginning, a founder,

533
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,360
you do everything that you need to do.

534
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,160
You're basically the, you know, the cook,

535
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,320
the you know, the office manager,

536
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,160
the recruiter, the programmer.

537
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,040
You do whatever you need to do

538
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,680
in the beginning,

539
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,560
you're all up the sleeves

540
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,480
and you work towards getting stuff done.

541
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,720
And, you know, in the beginning,

542
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,680
there's a lot of focus on you doing.

543
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,520
And of course, you hire employees,

544
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,240
but you are involved

545
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,400
in whatever needs to be done.

546
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,080
And there's a lot of things to be done

547
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,520
and shortage of resources.

548
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,240
And you make all of the decisions

549
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,520
in the beginning, a lot of the decisions

550
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,920
flow through you.

551
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,800
Over time, it becomes less of doing,

552
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,880
but more of making sure

553
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,320
that you have the right people in place

554
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,560
and you're empowering them

555
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,200
and you're creating the right

556
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,880
organizational structures

557
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,240
to be able to scale.

558
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,520
So, it's interesting, you know.

559
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,640
The type of work that you do

560
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,000
as the founder

561
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,280
really changes every two years

562
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,040
based on the size of the company

563
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,240
and based on kind of the

564
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,560
general scale of the business.

565
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
So, you know, it's not one day,

566
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,640
but it does, every two-year,

567
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,600
you kind of need to think about

568
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,160
what do I need to be doing,

569
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,040
what do I not need to be doing.

570
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,480
The things that you always own

571
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,000
as a CEO is the vision.

572
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,440
You always are responsible

573
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,600
for selling the company.

574
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
In selling I mean,

575
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,360
to investors, to employees, to media.

576
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,440
You're always on a sales mode.

577
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,040
You always drive culture.

578
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,040
That happens from the early days,

579
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,240
even when the company is larger,

580
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,120
that is a responsibility of the CEO.

581
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,160
And, you know, and again, vision.

582
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,120
Like vision and strategy

583
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,400
is sort of like connected.

584
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,040
And there are different types of CEOs.

585
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,520
There are sort of like

586
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,320
more product oriented CEOs

587
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,640
and there's more sales oriented CEOs.

588
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,480
I personally,

589
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,640
I put myself more in the first category.

590
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,926
And so, I'm very passionate

591
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,640
about product.

592
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,320
And I do get involved in product.

593
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,000
Even my level of involvement with product

594
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,320
has changed considerably over time.

595
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:07,880
In the beginning,

596
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,800
I was literally writing specs myself

597
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,760
and working with the engineers over time.

598
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,240
As we grew, we have product management.

599
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,400
Now we have a phenomenal

600
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,720
chief product officer.

601
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,960
Now, it's more about just

602
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,000
providing feedback around the roadmap,

603
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,200
making sure that

604
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,320
the vision is instilled

605
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,880
with the, you know,

606
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,760
the plan that we're putting together.

607
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,200
And then obviously, I have opinions around

608
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,720
certain product and specifically around

609
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,000
product experience that I

610
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,280
make sure to voice them.

611
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,240
But I am no longer in the driver's seat.

612
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,920
I'm more of a coach

613
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,440
of a reactive sort of position.

614
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,480
When you're building a company.

615
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,920
The main thing you want to do is

616
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
to make sure that you have

617
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,480
really great people that are motivated

618
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,760
and are pushing forward.

619
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,560
Because as you scale,

620
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,720
you can't be everywhere.

621
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,800
So, it becomes from you doing everything

622
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,400
to make sure that

623
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,520
you have phenomenal people

624
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,160
that are able to execute on your vision.

625
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,040
So, it sounds to me

626
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,440
like your journey is full of firsts.

627
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,120
Right?

628
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,920
Every two years, your role is changing.

629
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,720
But that means that really

630
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,280
every two years

631
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
you are reinventing your role as the CEO.

632
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,600
You have to adapt

633
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,360
to the new environment

634
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,400
every time you get a chance

635
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,080
to debrief over what you've learned

636
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,000
and sort of the skills you've mastered,

637
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,400
you all of a sudden have to reinvent

638
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,040
and master these new skills.

639
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,200
So, how do you keep yourself in check?

640
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,680
Because it sounds to me like a lot

641
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,960
of the things that you have to deal with

642
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,480
every now and then are brand new.

643
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,280
And maybe sometimes there are things

644
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,200
that you don't have

645
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,440
the right skill sets to do.

646
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,360
How do you, as the CEO,

647
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,760
the person that everybody is looking

648
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,560
towards, how do you keep

649
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,280
yourself balanced and making sure that

650
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,880
you're actually doing the right thing?

651
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,080
I think the way to do that is learn

652
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,800
from everybody around you,

653
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,400
learn from your investors and your board.

654
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,880
Learn from your executive team.

655
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,720
It's interesting.

656
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,200
As the founder or CEO of a company,

657
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,760
you get to be the only

658
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,760
executive on the team

659
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,480
without experience and learning. Right.

660
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,960
It's an interesting phenomenon like,

661
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,920
if we're talking scales,

662
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,080
you end up having very

663
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,840
senior executives around you,

664
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,560
which you are much less experienced

665
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,400
than them.

666
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,040
And that's okay

667
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,320
because you bring something different

668
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,800
to the table.

669
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,320
But you need to be

670
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,280
open and vulnerable

671
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,160
and you need to be able

672
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,920
to be in a position when you're learning

673
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,720
from people around you

674
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,000
and you're accepting feedback.

675
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,120
And so some of the changes

676
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,640
and an evolution for me,

677
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,200
again, this is my first time as a CEO,

678
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,920
I wasn't a CEO before,

679
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,360
so it is learning through feedback.

680
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,360
It is this being

681
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,320
in a position where

682
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,400
you have your ears open

683
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,760
and you're hearing what people

684
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,080
are saying and sometimes

685
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,120
it's painful feedback.

686
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,880
It's people telling you

687
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,840
you shouldn't be doing this,

688
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,720
you should be doing this.

689
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,400
And, you know, you could be in a position

690
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
and be defensive

691
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,760
and clutch on to

692
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,840
your previous behaviors,

693
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,560
but then you would not grow.

694
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:53,480
So, I think part of my ability to grow

695
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,360
as a CEO in this company is just,

696
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,000
you know, being open to feedback,

697
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,400
reflecting on it and thinking about

698
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,120
how I can get better every day.

699
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,920
And that is something that I do.

700
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,360
Every week, I think to myself,

701
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,480
what should I be doing

702
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,360
and what shouldn't I be doing.

703
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:10,800
I love that.

704
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,920
Eyal, thank you so much

705
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,080
for being so generous with your time.

706
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,800
I know how busy you are.

707
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,400
And you have so much on your plate,

708
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,160
and I really appreciate you

709
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,680
taking the time to provide your insights,

710
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,000
expertise and your humble nature.

711
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,040
Honestly, it really does inspire me

712
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,160
to watch a CEO as a learner.

713
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,920
And I hope to take a similar route

714
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,760
to yours and continue to be

715
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,080
a lifelong learner and keep checking

716
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,640
who are the right people around me

717
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,480
and what do I need to do

718
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,200
to continue learning and adapting.

719
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,720
Before we leave,

720
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,280
I need three words that you would use

721
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,080
to describe yourself.

722
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,120
Three words.

723
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,720
Honest.

724
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,960
Hardworking.

725
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:47,680
And funny.

726
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,320
I try to take things lightly.

727
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,800
I love that.

728
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,720
Eyal, toda raba

729
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,080
Thank you very, very much.

730
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,080
And best of luck with BlueVine.

731
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,000
And I hope to meet you in person

732
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,040
after this whole thing spins out,

733
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,640
this pandemic.

734
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,480
Thank you.

735
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,360
Same here. Take care.
