1 Eli Bildner, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. It is such a pleasure to have you here. It is a pleasure to be here. Thanks so much for having me. Where are you calling from? Oakland, California. Not too far. Oakland, California. Wonderful. Well I'm in Southern California so definitely not too far. But I'm originally, now situated in Palo Alto. So, Eli, 20 minutes is not gonna do nearly enough justice for everything that I wanna cover from Yale, to Stanford MBA to early employee at Coursera Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and Bloomberg Philanthropies, working on education and housing. Oh my God. Where do we even start? Eli, where do we start? I don't know man. You tell me. All right. Let's start from growth of tech, move to philanthropy, and then let's talk about this non-linear nature of your career because just before we started this, we started talking about this idea that you know, today people don't have to choose a linear path. So, you know talk to me about being an early employee at Coursera. Andrew Ng is one of the, a role model of mine. Talk to me a little bit about what you were doing there and the grow that you helped lead. Yeah. Totally. Andrew is a great guy. Everyone's got these sort of early embarrassing early career memories and I wasn’t so young when I was at Coursera. I traveled with Andrew to China a couple times as we were trying to build up business there. Oh yeah, Fulbright in China. I forgot to mention that. Yeah, this background in China, and yeah I can tell you all about that in a second. But I was having a little bit of a tough time emotionally, just not sure about what I was doing, and I was having dinner with Andrew and I just kinda like broke down and crying. I was sitting there with Andrew in a hotel in China and he was like comforting me and trying to like, So he's a really caring and sweet guy and a great leader, and obviously an incredible thinker. But I had a very fun sort of personal moment with him. I really respect him. Well then I can now share that one of my life's goals is to have a crying session with Andrew Ng. There we go well it can happen. There's hope for you yet. Yeah. So, I mean maybe to connect the career piece to my experience at Coursera piece, I ended up taking a job at Coursera early on, really not without much kind of strategy behind it. I was really interested in what it would mean for the way people access education to change. I've been involved in starting in the very early stages an Online Coding Bootcamp and, and one thing I didn’t appreciate coming to Coursera is that, at an early company where there is so much growth, like really, you end up dictating your role as much as the company does. And I came in with this experience having worked in China. Really, a couple months after I joined, Coursera was starting to think about other opportunities for us in China and it turned out that I was really the only one at the company who had business development and partnership experience in China. And so I was tasked - And you speak Mandarin fluently. I speak Mandarin maybe more fluently at the time. And I was tasked to kind of help project manage this effort and that that became a big part of my role. So, it definitely something I try to share with people who are thinking about kind of early stage career stuff, whenever you come in to a role, you know think about what is in your portfolio, even if it’s not something that was in the job description you signed up for they're probably, particularly at that stage of a company, there are a lot of opportunities to to bring that stuff to there. So, I came to Coursera and then, I was there from 2013 through late 2015. And then went to Stanford to do an MBA. And saw Coursera grow from 40 people 35, 40 people to probably 200 and really interesting time in the company and in the world. And then, after Coursera, I'd done some work in philanthropy before, but sort of have since graduating business school, I have worked more in a non-profits and philanthropy. And yeah, happy to talk about pros and cons of those two very different worlds. But I've seen both sides of that. How do you go from seeing a great company growing so fast, a lot of it under also your initiatives, and then you're going to a business school which inherently business school, it's business and a lot of the business school classes I really hope one day I'll be able to do that as well. I heard about the touchy-feely class of the GSB and all these different experiences. It doesn’t seem like they are guiding necessarily for philanthropy and for non-profits. Where did that even come from? Yeah, I mean there are probably, I don’t know, fewer than five people in my class of 400 who went into non-profits or at least operating non-profits. So, not a huge focus. Although there's a lot at Stanford around social innovation, and yeah there's a lot of good exposure there. But it's not part of the culture and part of it either. But one thing that I learned at Coursera that has stuck with me, is, you know companies love to talk about their social mission and their impact and we're a mission-driven company, and like you know, I think truth be told, a lot of the time that - if can I get to say this on the show - bulls**t it's like more marketing than anything. Definitely. I work in a community non-profit now, but I'm also like, I mean there's nothing wrong with running a successful business and serving customers and serving employees well. And how you run it really matters. And you don’t need to dress it up with this whole like you know "We're a mission driven Fintech company working on payment solutions" Well yeah, I'm sure it's good for the world but just own, like you're a great company. There's nothing wrong with that. So, and yeah, what I came to believe through my work at kind of mission-driven community, I really respect Coursera, is that, if you're a for profit, and particularly venture backed company, you're always gonna be migrating towards your highest growth and highest margin opportunities. And at Coursera, that meant like Coursera was never been, was never gonna be a company that was focused on serving the most vulnerable people in the world. That just not what it was built to do. It was built to scale really quickly through venture capital and through technology And grow, and migrate towards the best business opportunities for the company which have turned out to be in corporate learning and development and in traditional degree programs. I think that's great. I really believe in what Coursera is doing in the world. I'm really proud of having been a part of the company. I love the people there but it's not enough that, you know Our economy does not solve necessarily for the problems of the most traditionally underserved and most vulnerable in the population that's just a fact So, I knew, coming out of my experience at Coursera, that I wanted to think more, and work more on, anchor on a population as opposed to anchoring on a business model and non-profits are really good at that. I love it. Yeah. I think it's incredible. And I think this take on impact, and what really needs to be solved. That’s really inspiring. But then, you go and you actually join some of the most notable organizations in the world for this type of work. You, tell me a little bit about this Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and what you were doing there and then the Bloomberg Philanthropy? Yeah, I've always been a big fan of China. You know, create your own career opportunities. And so much of it just has to do with timing. And during my MBA summer, I was just thinking about what to do. I got connected from a friend and a mentor to someone who is basically the kind of chief of staff or intermediary of Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan's philanthropy which hadn't launched then. And she was helping them stand it up. And so I became their first, Oh, it was just starting back then. It just starting. Yeah. I became their first intern. And I think I just always had been drawn to kind of these early stage experiences but I think philanthropy, you know, each sector I've been involved in whether it's businesses, whether its philanthropy, whether its operating non-profits, they all have an important role. And one thing that’s very powerful about philanthropy is its convening power. Its agenda setting power. It's sort of like the medium in that way in that it's remarkable how little money it takes to change a conversation or to create a conversation. And so, I'm really What does that mean? So, like as an example, particularly with public actors, or state governments, local governments, even the federal government, there's so little, and even companies You know, very very few companies, organizations, policy actors have discretionary money just lying around. And so, if you're one of these actors, and you wanna try something really new, you really have very few places to turn and philanthropy is one of them. And so, you know even if you're, So just to give you a specific example, I was working with Bloomberg Philanthropies, evaluating a bunch of different programs that they might invest in to spur investment in career and technical education so helping students enter mostly non-degree pathways, or help equip them with skills. The State of Delaware was looking to do something really different with how they structured career and technical education and they were looking for funding to do it So I went down there to understand what they were thinking. They'd ask for a few million dollars. Now, the state of Delaware, their entire budget for K12 I don't know what it is off the top of my head, but it's certainly hundreds of millions of dollars. But for a grant the request of $3,000,000 they brought out the governor, a senator the CEO of a major company. Like that is what the promise of a few million dollars of discretionary capital could unlock. And so, if you're a funder, you have this unbelievable, you know, everyone’s gonna answer your call. And it's a tremendous power and privilege that comes with a lot of responsibility in my mind. But if you're someone like, you don't have millions of dollars to give away it makes working in philanthropy interesting because if you can help funders channel their energy in productive ways like you really do have a good shot of changing conversations and setting agendas. Wow. No that's insane. So then you move on to Bloomberg and do you do something similar over there as what you did in Chan Zuckerberg Initiative? Largely. With Chan Zuckerberg Initiative I was focused on helping them think about how they might improve housing affordability in California and particularly in the Bay Area. And then at Bloomberg, my work was more around higher education and career education pathways. But similar kind of philanthropic advising, which is just, it's of these things you know, going back to the thread we started before the interview around career, that you know sometimes you just learn that you have a skillset or that, you know, you kind of end up in a network and and then building a portfolio of projects around that can be really rewarding. So for me, part of that is just been getting to advice different philanthropies on how they spend their money and what projects they pursue. So what is Concourse Education? I believe you're wearing, I believe the the logo is on your sweatshirt, right? Yeah I'm wearing my Concourse hoodie So Concourse is a non-profit that I co-founded about three years ago. That was my first take at starting and operating a non-profit and we're a college program that helps particularly low-income working adults in California at an accelerated low-cost Bachelor’s Degree. Wow. So, you're helping them actually achieve their dream. And how do you actually go about doing that? So, we have a, our headline goal is to dramatically simplify the college experience for working adults who are, you're competing for their attention with kids, with work with all the complications of life and particularly for people who might be working more than one job, or low-wage jobs. And so, you know they don't have time to be on the phone for two hours with the financial aid office or try to figure out what forms to file or you know, if they need academic help to figure out the then different places they might go to get it like college needs to be designed for them And so that's what we've done. We basically redesigned the college experience to really serve that student population and we have done that by partnering with two accredited universities. So we're a stand alone 51c3 non-profit. We've kind of a white label-ish partnership with these universities where we essentially ride off their accreditation and their access to financial aid to again create this better college experience for working students. Incredible. So, Eli, over all these years working with non-profits, Trying to solve really meaningful issues. I mean, these are not simple issues to solve. You know it's one thing to say, "Okay I'm gonna do startup that you know, makes you a better runner with a device" or whatever. It's another thing to say, "Okay, I'm gonna tackle this problem of low-income people trying to attain a college education while going through the different adversities that life has to offer." I'd love to sort of pick your brain over the last few minutes that we have. What are some of your earned secrets over this non-profit sector about what does it take to go and really challenge these big big problems? Yeah. It's a great question. I think one is the just right size of expectations. You know, non-profits, you're not gonna change the world in two years. They’re really slow build organizations and for a couple reasons. One is the problems, as you referenced are really intractable. These are hard problems to solve. Two, you know almost definitionally they sort of are non-market problems and there's market failures so you're kind of you're running against headwinds. And then three, in terms of what is the what is the lifeblood that keeps non-profits going? Obviously it's called profit capital. Even for an earned revenue non-profit like us where we actually earn money from our services we still need our profit capital to grow. And philanthropies are so different from VC. So, just to give you a sense of what that looks like in practice. With VC, if you're an associate at a VC firm you're looking for deals where it's a 10x, a 20x, a 100x. That's gonna be a good portfolio of work. If you're asking for money from a philanthropy, they have a very different orientation. First of all, it's not so clear what a 10x, or a 100x is. Sure. But it's more in the impact for, the whole conversation is centered more around impact rather than return. It's centered more on impact and more on than more on a return. But a program officer is not necessarily incentivized to go for the riskiest proposition. Because even if it does pay off, paying off could take place over 10 to 20 years. And things that go really badly, go really badly in like six to 12 months. So, just from an incentive perspective, philanthropy not incentivized to really do super risky things. At the same time, philanthropy very reasonably. Because non-profits are not you know, most non-profits are not on a track to become self-sustaining on earned revenue, you know, if you're a philanthropy, you don’t wanna set up a non-profit with a $5 million annual budget in year one. And then year two, they have that cliff where it's like, if we don't raise $5 million, we're dead. So, non-profits, the way they work is they're constantly, we're constantly raising our next month of runway all the time. And what this means, from resourcing perspective is it's really hard to invest in like a five or 10, or even a two-year time prize like in a for profit company. So, I think the headline in all of this is that non-profit philanthropy there's really valuable places to work. They are trade-offs and one of the trade-offs is that it can feel really sloggy and it's more of a slow burn than most of the time in for profits. So, do you see yourself, we talked about this idea of non-linear career pathways. Do you see yourself going back to the sort of the business sector and the for-profit sector? Or is it something that you're really passionate about that you see yourself going forever? Yeah. I'm not an idealogue about any particular organization of an entity like you know, some companies are great, that's for profits, there are non-profits, that are great that believe in the importance and the role of government. And so, my hope and maybe to end the conversation where we started I think, I learned about myself that I love having a portfolio of things I work on. And so, I would be surprised, although not shocked if I, if I never spend 10 or 15 or 20 years on one thing in my career. It's just not exactly who I am. Or not who I've been. Although we all can change. One thing I like to share with people who are thinking about their own careers and career trajectories is that that's okay. Like I think for me I felt that was very not okay for awhile and I was talking to a mentor of mine and he basically asked, "Have you ever considered that this is okay? Like this is not a problem to solve?" But maybe a ... to solve around? Totally. Exactly. Well played. So, if anyone's listening to this who's thinking about their own career, and career design like you know, maybe look at the patterns that you've created in your early career and think critically about if you've problematized them. Is this actually a problem? And if it feels like a problem, how might I make it not a problem? And sometimes that can be I think liberating. Definitely. No, no I love it. You know, we have just about a minute and a half left. And I have so many more questions. But, I have the most important one. And I'm gonna put you on the spot. So, I apologize in advance. I'd love for you to tell me three words that would best describe yourself. That you would best describe yourself Or that one of your co-founders would describe you or Andrew Ng would describe you as? Oh man. Okay. Probably, curious. Earnest. Very earnest. And neurotic. Like a good Jewish guy. Very neurotic. I love it. Does it help with business? Sometimes, it creates a lot mental anx but sometimes helps I suppose. Yeah. I love it. Eli, thank you so much for the time. Thank you so much for the inspiration. I mean, this non-linear path that you're talking about I think it's something that's really, it's really ... And I had this really interesting talk, with Alyssa Rapp, who is a GSB lecturer I talked with her awhile back and I believe we already by the time this airs her video would already be published. And one of the most interesting things that she was talking about was her non-linear path that she got that she saw her mother go through And today, really we have this privilege. And especially that we get to go to these really great institutions and we get to harness all these different skillsets It's almost a waste not to go and try to put our feet in, to dive into different waters and to test different fields and see where we can make an impact n various sectors. Not just one. Well put. Yeah. Toda raba. It's been a pleasure. Thanks so much and great to be here. Thank you and we'll need to catch up over a beer when I'm back in Palo Alto and this whole covid thing is over. Beautiful. Let's do it Cool. Take care. Bye bye Eli. Thank you.
