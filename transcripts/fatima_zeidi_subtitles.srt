1
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,640
Wonderful. Okay.

2
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,440
Fatima Zaidi, thank you so much

3
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,120
for being on my show.

4
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,760
How are you?

5
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,520
I'm doing well.

6
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,960
Thank you for having me.

7
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,480
Of course.

8
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,920
Where are you calling from right now?

9
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,280
I am currently based out of Toronto.

10
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,760
As soon as the pandemic happened,

11
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,600
I came back home.

12
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,360
Because, well, we have free health care.

13
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,440
Very well info now.

14
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,160
And some good leadership behind us.

15
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,800
So, yeah, we're in good shape down here.

16
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,280
Wonderful.

17
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,560
But you actually have a long history

18
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,440
with Toronto, with the various startups

19
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,680
that you've worked with, right?

20
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,320
So, have you been on the line between

21
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,400
the United States and Toronto often?

22
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,480
I would say I was born and raised

23
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,320
in the Middle East

24
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,520
and I moved to North America

25
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,720
when I was just turning 17.

26
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,120
And I definitely have spent

27
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,960
a large part of my career in Canada.

28
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,760
And then this last company

29
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,560
that I've started,

30
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,800
which is called Quill,

31
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,360
it's a one stop shop marketplace

32
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,280
for podcasters.

33
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,520
So, if you're an indie podcaster,

34
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,000
or a company looking to start a show

35
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,920
or even outsource elements of your show,

36
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,320
we work with companies

37
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,400
on indie podcasters

38
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,680
to scale through their podcasts.

39
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,240
So, right after this,

40
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,200
you're going to help me learn

41
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,120
how to scale my own podcasts, obviously.

42
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,080
I was going to make a joke

43
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,280
right at the beginning being like,

44
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,560
"Oh, you're recording on a zoom."

45
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,160
"I don't want to be too critical here."

46
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,200
But no, it's great.

47
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,600
I love that you're in university

48
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,320
and I love that you're starting a podcast.

49
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,120
You're definitely ahead of the hype curve.

50
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,560
But just due to the nature

51
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,280
of this business,

52
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,680
we are more US focused.

53
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,080
So, I would say most of the brands

54
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,880
that we're working with

55
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,760
and we own a conference out in LA.

56
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,160
So, I would say that I have been spending

57
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,080
the majority of my time

58
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
the last couple of years

59
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,000
based out of different parts of the US.

60
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,360
Whether it be Chicago or LA

61
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,000
where our event is.

62
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,840
But as soon as the pandemic happened,

63
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,200
I was on the first flight home.

64
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,720
And I'm staying right here

65
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,840
until the foreseeable future.

66
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,100
I love it. I love it. Okay.

67
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,160
Definitely. Definitely.

68
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,520
So, what I was saying is that

69
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,720
I'd love for you to take me

70
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,920
a little bit about back to your journey.

71
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,920
You're both named, No, we're fine.

72
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,160
You were both named the top 30 marketers

73
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,000
by marketing magazine.

74
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,800
You share the stage with Richard Branson

75
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,280
and places like the Web Summit

76
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,160
and other conferences

77
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,920
as part of the National Speakers Bureau.

78
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,680
So, talk to me a little bit

79
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,520
about this dynamic.

80
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,440
You were both in marketing.

81
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,880
VP business development

82
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,800
in various startups.

83
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,640
One of them appeared on the Dragon's Den.

84
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,600
The Canada version of Shark Tank.

85
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,760
So, who are you Fatima?

86
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,640
And what drives you

87
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,400
to these different endeavors?

88
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,800
Yeah, it's a great question.

89
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,560
I would say first and foremost,

90
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,120
I'm definitely a sales person.

91
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,120
So, when I moved to Canada,

92
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,600
I didn't really have a dime to my name.

93
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,720
But I knew that I wanted to build a life

94
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,040
for myself here.

95
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,360
It was one of the few countries

96
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,400
in the world that I thought

97
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,960
could provide you opportunities

98
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,320
based on merit and hard work,

99
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,480
regardless of the color of your skin

100
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,200
and your gender.

101
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,280
And so, I'm really glad

102
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,800
that I made the decision to move.

103
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,120
I worked corporate gigs, while at first

104
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,000
I had to put myself to university.

105
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,400
So, I did part time at jobs.

106
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,720
Got three jobs through school.

107
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,800
And eventually graduated debt free

108
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,400
and joined the corporate world.

109
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,040
And I've always been in sales.

110
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,080
And so, the corporate world taught me

111
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,920
a lot of the structured processes

112
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,680
behind sales.

113
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
But then, eventually,

114
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,200
I moved into the entrepreneurship

115
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,080
and startup space

116
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,080
where I would help companies scale.

117
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,600
And I would say

118
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,640
I'm definitely good at marketing

119
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,440
because I've worked with

120
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,680
tech marketing agencies

121
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,880
to scale their companies.

122
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,080
But I'm definitely not a marketing expert.

123
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,000
I would call myself 100% a sales person.

124
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,800
And that is why I started my own company,

125
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,560
because I wanted to work

126
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,040
on my own bottom line and pipeline

127
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,800
rather than somebody else's.

128
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,360
So, give me a few of the insights

129
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,160
that you've learned about sales

130
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,080
over these years.

131
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,840
What are some of the

132
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,480
key foundational things

133
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,160
that excite you about this industry

134
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,760
that as a young entrepreneur,

135
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,440
I might not even be aware of?

136
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,240
Well, being in sales

137
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,680
is an emotional rollercoaster.

138
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,280
Some days you're,

139
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,120
very similar to entry into the startup

140
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
and entrepreneurship world

141
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,440
where some days you feel like

142
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,360
you're on the top of the world

143
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,280
and some days it's rock bottom.

144
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,800
And I think that good sales people

145
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
realized that they shouldn't be taking

146
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,360
these rejections personally.

147
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,320
It takes a lot more work

148
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,400
getting your ducks in a row

149
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,320
than simply managing and to line up

150
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,920
and say,

151
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,760
I'm hiring for my sales team.

152
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,280
I'm always looking for people

153
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,440
who are extremely resilient.

154
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,960
People who don't feel rejection

155
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,160
and people who have the ability

156
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,200
to keep putting themselves.

157
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,680
Being a salesperson has really trained me

158
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,040
to becoming a really great entrepreneur.

159
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,440
And essentially it's the same DNA

160
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,880
that's required.

161
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,620
Right. So, now talk to me a little bit

162
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,160
about this latest experience with Quill.

163
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,960
What are you trying to do

164
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,080
and how are you bringing

165
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,080
those sales insights

166
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,720
into this new endeavor?

167
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,040
So, I was running an agency

168
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,920
for a few years

169
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,280
where we used to do marketing

170
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,920
for a lot of corporate clients.

171
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,200
And my job was primarily

172
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,400
bringing in the revenue.

173
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,680
And I eventually saw a gap in the market

174
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,480
where I started seeing a lot of brands

175
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,640
were moving into the podcasting space.

176
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,560
And so, I decided

177
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,040
to productize our services.

178
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,560
I sold the agency and launched Quill,

179
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,280
which is the world's

180
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,880
first marketplace for podcasters.

181
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,760
We still have an agency umbrella

182
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,200
to the business because a lot of those

183
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,080
corporate companies came back and said,

184
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,800
"Well, it's great that you have

185
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,280
a marketplace and a product.

186
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,440
But what we also need

187
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,240
is a full service team around us."

188
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,120
So, we have both.

189
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,960
We have the scalable

190
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,680
online technology platform

191
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,400
similar to Fiverr and UpWork

192
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,800
for podcasting.

193
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,960
And then we also have

194
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,120
our in-house service team

195
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,480
where we do podcasts for big brands

196
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,560
along with our conference.

197
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,000
And so, that's really the reason

198
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,640
that I impetus of why I decided to launch.

199
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,560
And we've been working on this company

200
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,720
for almost a year now

201
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,760
and we launched right before the pandemic.

202
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,280
So, that was

203
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,920
an interesting experience as well.

204
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,760
Launching a company

205
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
right through the pandemic

206
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,920
and then actually scaling

207
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,720
during the pandemic

208
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,680
was a very interesting experience.

209
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,520
So, talk to me a little bit

210
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,800
about this world of podcasting.

211
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,920
And I've just discovered this

212
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,720
in the recent months since covid started.

213
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,400
Because I used to go and meet

214
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,280
a lot of people that I speak with.

215
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
I used to meet them for coffee

216
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,120
or for walks or go to their offices.

217
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,200
All of a sudden covid hits.

218
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,720
And I'm like, okay,

219
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,880
now I have to do Zoom.

220
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,560
Well, actually, when I'm visiting them

221
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,120
in the office,

222
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,440
it's really weird to just bring

223
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,640
a video and then station

224
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
and then shoot.

225
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,600
But if we're on Zoom

226
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,560
hitting record, we almost forget

227
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,040
that we're recording this right now.

228
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,760
We're actually recording

229
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,680
an episode right now.

230
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
It feels much more of a

231
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,680
just like a genuine informal conversation.

232
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,360
What is happening to podcasts?

233
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,520
And how do you see this trajectory?

234
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,240
Because it sounds like

235
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,560
you build this company

236
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,120
right at a beautiful time period

237
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,840
where all these Web conferences

238
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,400
are taking off

239
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,560
and this sharing of information

240
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,960
is happening in this medium now.

241
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,320
Absolutely.

242
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,760
It is definitely the future.

243
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,040
And we're really very well

244
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,240
positioned in all time.

245
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,480
from a launch perspective.

246
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,840
Podcasting is definitely

247
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,880
on an exponential growth curve

248
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,960
where brands are realizing

249
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,280
that a lot of their marketing spend

250
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,840
and tactics on things like events

251
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,240
are no longer applicable.

252
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
And so, they're looking for

253
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,160
additional tactics

254
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,240
to spend their money on.

255
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,040
And podcasting is definitely,

256
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,040
now we're at a million podcasts.

257
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,320
20% of them are active.

258
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,360
Actually 200 to 300,000 of those

259
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,000
were only added

260
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,480
in the last 60 days.

261
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,160
So, there's about 4,000 new shows

262
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,200
that are popping up every day.

263
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,000
So, the growth curve is huge.

264
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,240
And we have definitely seen

265
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,440
that as soon as we launched,

266
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,920
we had brands knocking on our door,

267
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,320
asking to be create podcast

268
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,200
and create shows.

269
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,240
And it's been really interesting

270
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,760
because oftentimes,

271
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,200
I get asked all the time like,

272
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,920
"Is it a saturated community?"

273
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
"Are there a lot of podcasts out there?"

274
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,640
And I always say,

275
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,440
"Well, let's compare it

276
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,600
to other forms of content.

277
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,720
There's six hundred plus million blogs.

278
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,680
There's 30 million YouTube channels.

279
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,480
There's 1.5 billion websites.

280
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,760
When we're looking at podcasting,

281
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,160
there's only one million podcasts.

282
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,720
And only 20% of those podcasts are active.

283
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,480
So, really, there's only 200,000

284
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,400
active podcasts.

285
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,080
So, I always say, brands

286
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,480
and indeed podcasters

287
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,440
who are in this space today

288
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,080
are definitely ahead of the hype curve.

289
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,280
And very similar to how

290
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,600
in the 1980's companies

291
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,040
had a phone number for their business

292
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,200
and then they had a website

293
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,880
and they had social media.

294
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,720
Similar to that.

295
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,440
I think that in the next five to 10 years,

296
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,760
every company and every person

297
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,400
will either have a podcast

298
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,840
or be advertising on one.

299
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,840
Fascinating. Okay, two questions

300
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,400
that I have to know the answer to that

301
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
are now jumping in.

302
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,760
First of all, why is it difficult

303
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,160
for brands to create podcasts?

304
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,160
And why does a brand like Gap

305
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,800
need to come to an agency and say,

306
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,520
"Hey, can you please help me

307
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,160
create this thing with high quality?"

308
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,880
That's the first question.

309
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
The second question is,

310
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,120
what are some tangible things

311
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,920
the average student like myself

312
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,640
that wants to start a podcast,

313
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,800
what are some critical things

314
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,040
that I need to take in mind,

315
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,480
whether it's the technology,

316
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,520
the reaching out to people,

317
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,080
the sharing of the content?

318
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,680
So, those two things I'm just

319
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,040
completely fascinated by right now.

320
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah, for sure.

321
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,120
So, I would say with brands,

322
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,680
it's definitely not that hard

323
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,640
to create a podcast.

324
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,080
I think any brand can do it.

325
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,760
But if you're looking

326
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,520
for a high production, high quality show

327
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,240
that matches the value of your brand,

328
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,120
then definitely you can't necessarily,

329
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:37,800
you have to have

330
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,240
a lot of different layers of a show.

331
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,880
So, you need someone

332
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,120
who's good at pre-production.

333
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,640
You need someone who's good at content.

334
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,680
The technical side,

335
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,800
which is the sound engineering,

336
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,320
the editing, the recording.

337
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,480
And there's the distribution.

338
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,800
Then there's the marketing.

339
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,640
So, there's just, and guess sourcing.

340
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,960
There's just so many different layers

341
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,440
to creating a really good show.

342
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,680
It's going to be very hard for you

343
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,880
to find that in one hire or two hire.

344
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,960
So, that is why I think oftentimes

345
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,840
if you're on a low budget

346
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,840
and you're an indie podcaster,

347
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,400
for sure you hire a freelancer

348
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,960
to help you.

349
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,080
But if you're a brand,

350
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,120
oftentimes you're looking

351
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,520
for high quality production.

352
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,240
You're going to need a team around you.

353
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,560
What are the costs

354
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,200
that are generally associated

355
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,120
with like an indie podcast?

356
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,000
So, let's say a friend of mine

357
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,360
wants to start a podcast,

358
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,840
thinking strategically,

359
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,160
what are the associated costs with that?

360
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,160
Well, so I would say for an indie podcast,

361
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,840
like if you are starting one right now

362
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,680
for university, the things to consider

363
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,200
is recording platforms.

364
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
I never recommend that people use Zoom.

365
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,560
Because Zoom is a conference line.

366
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,520
Not a podcast audio platform.

367
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,840
I know we're using it right now

368
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,560
and I'm totally turning a blind eye to it.

369
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,800
But for example,

370
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,400
a platform like Zencastr,

371
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,880
which is, I think it's free during covid,

372
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,760
otherwise it's $20 a month,

373
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,640
it is optimized for sound quality.

374
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,440
So, it is actually devised

375
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,760
for people who are podcasting.

376
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,400
And so, the sound quality is much higher.

377
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,440
So that is my first tip

378
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,320
as an indie podcaster.

379
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,560
Or if you're recording yourself

380
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,920
and you don't have budget to spend,

381
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,360
record on a platform

382
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,680
like Zencastr  or Cleanfeed.

383
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,800
Don't use platforms like Anchor,

384
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,360
your phone or Skype or Zoom.

385
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,160
Because the audio is usually

386
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,160
very low in it.

387
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,800
Like retention rate would be low.

388
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,400
I have to ask, though, because the way

389
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,200
that I was approaching

390
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,960
this program as well

391
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,720
as I'm seeing you, you're seeing me

392
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,640
the person is going to view this show,

393
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,080
especially on our Facebook page,

394
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,200
they're going to have the ability

395
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,280
to see us interact on video.

396
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,000
And it's almost like watching a TV show.

397
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,520
Now, this podcast that we're recording

398
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,160
is also going to be

399
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,680
on Spotify and Apple podcasts.

400
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,520
But I'm seeing the value of the video

401
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,120
that in 2020 is something

402
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,760
that is increasingly important.

403
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,720
Because while I imagine,

404
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,840
the audiobooks have been around

405
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,480
for a pretty long time,

406
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,120
and I've foresee podcast to run

407
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,960
for a long time, I know my friends and I,

408
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,440
we're looking for the video content

409
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,600
that we can see through our phone

410
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,800
and through our touch screens.

411
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,640
So, do you see that as being

412
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,440
an upcoming medium?

413
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,200
Or do you still think

414
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,880
that the audio part of it

415
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,120
is still the most crucial piece?

416
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,200
Yeah, so actually,

417
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,680
most of our clients, I would say,

418
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,920
would like a video component.

419
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,120
Because they have YouTube channels

420
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,600
that they upload their content on.

421
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,760
And so, typically what we do

422
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,160
is we record on Zencastr

423
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,440
and we have Zoom on mute

424
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,280
in the background.

425
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,520
So, you're still getting the video,

426
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,440
but your audio quality is much higher.

427
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,440
So, we actually do

428
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,160
a lot of video podcasts as well.

429
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,680
The other thing,

430
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm readying this done for me

431
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,600
for the next episode.

432
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,040
The other thing I would also, so, yeah,

433
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,280
just use Zoom as your video component

434
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,080
and just use Zencastr as the audio.

435
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,440
The other thing I would say is,

436
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,760
Zencastr is coming out

437
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,640
with a video component

438
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,400
by the end of the summer.

439
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,960
I'm actually on the wait list for it.

440
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,360
So, it's going to be a watch all

441
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,480
in one component.

442
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,920
Because they recognize that people

443
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,400
do really want the video.

444
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:36,920
And I agree.

445
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,880
It's better engagement.

446
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,840
We're getting to know each other

447
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,040
in a very organic way.

448
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,560
And it's hard to bring that to life

449
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,040
as much as quickly

450
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,560
in an audio consumption format.

451
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,560
Okay. So, Fatima, I have to ask

452
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,280
because this is the second part

453
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,880
of the conversation

454
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,000
that I was very excited about.

455
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,240
This whole notion of raising capital.

456
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,440
How covid has impacted

457
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,600
the diversity of founders.

458
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,240
Whether it's the gender,

459
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,480
or whether it's of color or race.

460
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,240
Talk to me a little bit

461
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,320
about your insights

462
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,960
in regarding to this scene.

463
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,680
What has happened before covid

464
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,720
in terms of the entrepreneurship scene?

465
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,560
And then, how has this been accelerated

466
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,200
through covid?

467
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,160
So, two things on that.

468
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,640
I would say, for starters,

469
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,880
I think covid has had a very

470
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,280
uneven effect on women

471
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,760
because for the most part,

472
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,800
a lot of women are on the front line

473
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,760
in the service industries

474
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,560
right in the heart of the pandemic.

475
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,960
And secondly,

476
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,040
I think the brunt of unpaid work

477
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,000
falls on the majority of women.

478
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,080
Whether that's household chores,

479
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,160
taking care of your children,

480
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,520
taking care of the elderly,

481
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,440
which is in itself so difficult

482
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,240
when services are closed,

483
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,800
schools and daycares are shut.

484
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,520
So, I would say

485
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,960
if you're a female entrepreneur,

486
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,040
I can't even imagine raising

487
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,760
or running your company

488
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,120
and not only having

489
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,840
to reimagine your products and services

490
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,640
in the immediate short term and pivot

491
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,600
during this pandemic,

492
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,240
but also taking care of your children

493
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,280
full time, which in itself

494
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,760
is a full time job.

495
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,960
So, that would be my first thing.

496
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,320
I would say that the pre-existing barriers

497
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,560
that female founders face

498
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,040
before the pandemic

499
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,560
are further compounded with things

500
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,160
like access to finance,

501
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,600
access to mentors and networks

502
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,200
and gendered priorities.

503
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,760
The second thing I would say is,

504
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
in reality, there is no pipeline problem

505
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,000
when it comes to raising capital.

506
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,120
There are a ton of female founders.

507
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,120
And in fact, I was reading an article

508
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,680
by Business Insider and they said

509
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,240
that black female founders, specifically,

510
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,800
are the fastest growing population

511
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,520
of entrepreneurs.

512
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,040
So, investors that are claiming

513
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,160
that there are not enough

514
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,080
minority female founders to invest in

515
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,960
are clearly not looking hard enough.

516
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,080
And I think the clog in the pipeline

517
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,400
is basically resulting in founders

518
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,600
like myself or founders of color,

519
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
or just female founders in general,

520
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,920
not falling into the investors

521
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,880
preconceived notion of what

522
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,760
a successful entrepreneur constitutes up

523
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,080
and what they should look like

524
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,560
resulting in two things.

525
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,080
Either they become a part

526
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,480
of some diversity quota

527
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,080
and some minimal charity fund,

528
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,840
or we lose the opportunity to somebody

529
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,120
who looks more the part.

530
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,960
And so, myself included,

531
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,280
I was in the process of closing out

532
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,920
my seed round right before the pandemic,

533
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
right up to term sheets.

534
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,440
And because of the pandemic,

535
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,000
a lot of investors had to pull out

536
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,080
and actually ended up

537
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,920
being really good for us

538
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,280
because we quadrupled our revenue

539
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,560
and now don't need investment.

540
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,480
But we had to get really creative

541
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,320
in the short term

542
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,760
to bootstrap our services

543
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,080
so that we could stay afloat.

544
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,760
And I think a lot of founders

545
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,200
in my position who are women

546
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,880
are now looking at ways

547
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,760
to run their companies

548
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,120
without acquiring outside capital.

549
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,240
Wow. And is this different

550
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,880
than the founders that are male

551
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,120
and perhaps, that are not

552
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,040
in the minority race?

553
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,480
Is that specifically to the group

554
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,120
that you're referring to,

555
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,640
that you are seeing this behavior?

556
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,920
Yeah, I would definitely agree.

557
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,640
I mean, I would say that the stats

558
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,520
speak for themselves.

559
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,640
Like the average deal size

560
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,640
for men last year was 12 million.

561
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,960
And the average deal size

562
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,680
for women was five million.

563
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,400
If you look at the average deal size,

564
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,320
men have more than double.

565
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,080
But like the numbers aren't correlating

566
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,360
with the amount of female entrepreneurs

567
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,400
in the industry.

568
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,840
And that I understand. Right.

569
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,240
Like everyone has their personal

570
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,760
and conscious and unconscious biases.

571
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,240
You essentially want to invest in people

572
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,280
that look more like you.

573
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,600
And at the top level of investments,

574
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,520
it's mostly white males.

575
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,880
And so, I think part of the problem is

576
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,080
that investing companies, angels and VCs

577
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,640
need to start making sure

578
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,240
that their partners map that

579
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,680
of the general demographic.

580
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,440
And if they don't,

581
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,040
then they need to put in selection blinds

582
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,520
to remove their biases.

583
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,880
But, yeah, I mean, in the meantime,

584
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,320
I think definitely women are going to have

585
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,120
a really tough time bouncing back

586
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,880
from this experience

587
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,120
that we're going through.

588
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,160
Wow. Well, I'm definitely

589
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,640
going to remain optimistic in the end.

590
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,520
And hopefully, it's not as dire.

591
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,360
But it sounds incredible that you were

592
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,680
about to close the seed round

593
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,720
after the term sheets, covid hits,

594
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,200
and now you've quadrupled revenues.

595
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,040
And not just the fact that your valuation

596
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,920
is probably much higher than it was.

597
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,240
But now you're saying

598
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,360
that you're profitable

599
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,200
and you don't need to raise

600
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,380
the next investments.

601
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,240
Talk to me a little bit about this

602
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,520
National Speakers Bureau.

603
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,560
Why public speaking?

604
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,760
Why getting on stages

605
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,640
and sharing information, sharing stories?

606
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,600
Why do you do that?

607
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,560
I was approached by BNN Bloomberg

608
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,000
to start doing segments

609
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,240
and contribution columns

610
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,720
on topics that were

611
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,320
really extremely important to me.

612
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,920
And actually, diversity and inclusion

613
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,240
is one of the main topics

614
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,960
that I talk about.

615
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,360
Especially within the tech sector.

616
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,160
And so, I've just always been

617
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,960
really passionate about moving the dial.

618
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,600
Like moving to North America in itself

619
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,680
was moving the dial for me.

620
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,960
Because I grew up

621
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,240
in a very Middle Eastern culture,

622
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,120
which is very different

623
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,680
from what I've experienced here.

624
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,720
And so, I really wanted to share

625
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,840
not only my experience,

626
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,400
but how we can continue moving forward

627
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,800
from a diversity and inclusive efforts

628
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,280
and what companies need to be doing

629
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,600
to support entrepreneurs.

630
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,680
And so, I would say,

631
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,080
that's more my area of expertise,

632
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,000
along with tech and media trends for sure.

633
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,320
But I really enjoy public speaking.

634
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,040
I mean, obviously,

635
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,640
things have been put on a halt right now

636
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,480
with conferences and events being on hold.

637
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,520
But I've always really enjoyed

638
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,600
speaking to people.

639
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,720
Really sharing a lot of insights,

640
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,280
and it's more so 360s than feedback

641
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,680
has always been very mutual.

642
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,000
And I would say, public speaking

643
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,800
is definitely not for everyone.

644
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,600
But I just been one of the lucky.

645
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,880
I think I'm an extrovert.

646
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,080
So, it's worked really well for me.

647
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,960
But it's just one of those tactics

648
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,840
that I chose to build my personal brand.

649
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,400
And it worked really well for me.

650
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,360
First of all, I want to thank you again

651
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,600
for being so generous with your time.

652
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,520
It's been really inspiring to hear

653
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
both about your insights

654
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,640
about the tech ecosystem

655
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,120
and the financial side of it

656
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,920
and the raising capital,

657
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,280
but also in the podcasting side.

658
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,240
And I definitely took some notes

659
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,800
for myself on how to improve

660
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,080
for the next 200 episodes of the series.

661
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,740
But before we leave,

662
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,400
I have to put you on the spot one time

663
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,960
and ask you a personal question.

664
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,640
And I'd love to know three words

665
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,880
that you would use to describe yourself

666
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,760
or that any of your colleagues

667
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,640
would use to describe you

668
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,160
or anybody listening to you on stage,

669
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,000
how would they describe you.

670
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,800
Yeah. So, a good and bad, I want to try

671
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,760
to be as objective as possible.

672
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,960
I would say I am definitely,

673
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,440
I have a lot of hustle.

674
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,520
I think it's the DNA of all entrepreneurs.

675
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,800
We know it's 95% perspiration

676
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,880
and 5% inspiration.

677
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,280
So, definitely hustle

678
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,080
is something that I would say.

679
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,960
A little bit insane.

680
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,680
Crazy or insane would definitely be a word

681
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,640
that I would use to describe myself.

682
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,200
It's a combination of just like,

683
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,200
having a very crystallized dream

684
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,280
and focus in life

685
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,480
and just working tirelessly towards it.

686
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,720
And so, sometimes I think that

687
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,560
that can translate

688
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,400
into a type of intensity

689
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,520
that maybe doesn't resonate with everyone.

690
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,760
And I'm okay with that.

691
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:54,040
And I would say,

692
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,960
the third one is, oh, my goodness,

693
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,360
I'm like, it's so hard to narrow down

694
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:58,840
the third one.

695
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,200
I hate talking about myself in that way.

696
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,000
That's why it's the hardest question.

697
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,280
Yeah. It is a really hard question.

698
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,340
You've got me there.

699
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,200
You've stumped me.

700
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,160
I would probably say the last one

701
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,720
would be resilience.

702
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,280
Yeah. I would say that I'm just somebody

703
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,560
that like, because I don't know

704
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,880
if it's because I've been in sales

705
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,800
or where I've come from,

706
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,840
but just keep getting knocked down,

707
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,040
keep getting back up.

708
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,600
So, I don't take no for an answer.

709
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,120
Don't ask, don't get policy.

710
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,080
So, yeah, I would say hustle,

711
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,440
resilience and a little bit of crazy.

712
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,880
Which I think every needs.

713
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,520
One of the main things

714
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,720
that a lot of VCs on this show

715
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,560
have been telling me is that,

716
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,280
one of the skills

717
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,000
they consider most important

718
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,560
as you're starting

719
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,560
your entrepreneurial career,

720
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
is actually to boost sales.

721
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,960
And to understand what it's like

722
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,520
to get rejected ten times,

723
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,880
to only get one client.

724
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,880
And getting back up

725
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,480
and being able to deliver a message

726
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,880
clearly and concisely

727
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,960
so that it also impacts the other person

728
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,640
and not just yourself.

729
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,280
With this note, I need to send you off

730
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,840
to your next meeting [--]

731
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,200
But thank you very very much for the time.

732
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,480
This was fantastic.

733
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,160
And I'll definitely get back to you

734
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
on the new technologies

735
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,760
that I'm going to use.

736
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,600
I've already wrote them down for me.

737
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,680
Sounds good. Let me know.

738
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,080
Happy podcasting, Michael.

739
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,040
Thank you.

740
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,880
Thank you very much.

741
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,440
Take care.

742
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,280
Bye.
