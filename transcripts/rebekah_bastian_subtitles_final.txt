1 Rebekah Bastian, thank you for being on my show. How are you? I'm good. Thanks for having me. You're calling from Seattle, right? That's right. Wonderful. Wonderful. So, I can't wait to hear about your journey all the way from your college years, to becoming a VP at Zillow after 15 years of being there, both of product and community, and I'd love to understand how the two things intertwine because both of them seem so crucial today, especially as community people who've been talking about building a community and culture within companies for so long. So, I'd love to hear about this journey all the way to writing a book, Blaze Your Own Trail, and to founding a company. Way too much to go over in 20 minutes, but we'll try. Rebekah, take me back to your college days, because you actually have a pretty interesting story starting from your college days. So, I think I went to five colleges total. Wow. Yeah. The first one was a small liberal arts school ... high school, and I actually failed out of that. I went for music and just wasn't feeling it at the time I guess wasn't ... didn't really have my act together. And then after that, I moved up to Seattle with an ex-boyfriend and after working for ... ended up enrolling in the community college, actually I went to a couple different community colleges here, and then transferred into University of Washington for undergrad ... mechanical engineering and then ultimately ended up also getting my masters in mechanical engineering from UC Berkeley. So, a lot of educational transfers. Right. So on one hand, you're saying an entrepreneur and a published author, a VP at Zillow, one of the most well respected companies and startups in the United States and the world. Going to five different colleges and failing out of the first one. What was that about? What happened there? Well you know I think it's all part of the winding path. That's something that I've certainly lived my whole life is that it hasn't been linear and it hasn't always been intentional, even, you know, where I ended up, but that's what I think is important to talk about. And I think when you dig ... a lot of people that you might think are in successful places in their lives, it turns out that it's not always linear. And I think that being authentic about that ... like so many times when we're in one of those rough patches or screwing something up or something's not ... we look around and we see what seems like a bunch of really polished end results. We can feel like we're getting it wrong because of that winding ... So one of the things I've tried to do in the conversations I have, and now what we're building with OwnTrail, is really embracing that winding journey, because it's not wrong. It leads to some really interesting places. Amazing. Okay. So, before we go on to this winding path, non-linear career pathways and overall mentorship within OwnTrail, I'd love to talk a little bit about your experience with Zillow. Zillow, it's one of my favorite companies. I've loved the transition that's happened. And back at Stanford, I actually spent quite a meaningful time with some of the machine learning team to understand a little bit better about the Zestimate and what's happening there. But I'd love to hear what was it like spending 15 years at a fast growing company, going to be a VP of product and VP of community? So talk to me about the whole experience, but then also these two positions that you've held. Yeah I mean, short answer is super fun. I was one of the first employees at a stealth startup when I started there. And, which is exciting in and of itself, ... We grew in some really meaningful ways. Also not totally ... tried some things. Made some different turns in what we were building and how, but a lot of it was just, we had kind of guiding from the beginning in a really meaningful space to be working in around housing. And it was really fun to grow with the company. And when I started there, I was ... for a couple of few years before that, but I was still pretty junior in my career. And so I started as a pretty junior program manager. And then kept saying yes to things and raising my hand and trying new things and working on a lot of different areas of the product and starting initiatives and grew into ... VP of product role. And loved that. It was really fun. But then, what I ended up doing after a while ... I started taking on just a lot of side projects that were really aligned with what I was passionate about. So, that was really thinking about how we create social impact with ... and how we create more diversity in our ... And how we had this great culture from the beginning organically, but how do we foster that as we really grow into a bigger company. And so- What were some of the biggest memories that you've had? Looking at those 15 years, some of those like the big "aha moments" or highlights that you've had within this incredible startup. Well, I think the biggest thing is the friendships. I ended up with just lifelong friends there and really incredible people that I have the honor of working with. The mobile apps were really cool. That was something I kind of took on as a side project when the iPhone first came out. I worked with some developers on what would be Zillow's first mobile app, and we just did it on the side for about a year and it really took off. And ultimately I ended up getting to be the first product manager for our mobile initiatives and really leading a lot of that, and that was really exciting. And then, yes, starting the community culture team was really exciting 'cause that was a brand new team and a new initiative as well. That was really all of ... passions into an entire new area of my career. So, what does entail the role of a VP of culture and community? So the way that, basically, I created this vision for what that team would look like and was able to hire a really phenomenal ... around it. And the vision was really had equity and belonging at its core. So, from the ground up, it was really about creating equitable opportunities and just ... in the workplace. And from there, layering on like the ways that we culturally engage with each other and in our communities. From there, really thinking about how we can be leveraging people's unique skills and passions to solve bigger social issues for our business and products. So, it was a little bit ... based on my background and skills, but it was a really just incredible learning curve, incredible opportunity to make a difference in the organization. And I was able to hire an amazing team that I really learned a lot from. So, the idea was that, as VP of culture and community, this was internal within Zillow, how do you foster creative collaboration within Zillow. So, what are some insights can you share with me as young entrepreneur, or my friends who are watching this, about creating a sustainable and healthy culture within a diverse community? Obviously today and throughout 2020, this whole notion of diversity and acceptance and culture has been so monumental to all of our lives and for everyone here. So, what are some things that you learned throughout these years at Zillow that I can take on with me? A lot of our philosophy behind how we built and structured this None of this work is something that can be carried out and done by a single team or by a few people; it really needs to be part of the company's culture. And so, we were really focused on creating pathways for engagement for employees. So it's really saying like, fortunately we didn't have the problem and trying to get people excited about this work. ... enthusiastic employee base who really wanted to do the right thing. That was part of our core values, and people really loved that. And so it was more about ... the path for people to use their unique skills and their passions and get involved in the way that feels right to them in order to ... everything from just everyone learning how to apply an equity lens to the business that they're doing to getting involved with leading our ... or culture committees or working on social impact products. Or all these different pathways for people to do that. And I think that's a methodology that probably applies to different companies but also a lot of different community efforts. And any time you have a group of people that ... big change, then it's about creating those pathways to do so in a way that really brings people together to create that change. Wonderful. Okay. So, you go and you write your own book. And it's a different type of book, right? It's not just starting in page one and finishing on the last page and reading through the whole thing. You kind of jump around. And talk to me a little bit about this book and how that inspired you to then create your own venture, OwnTrail. Yeah. So the book, Blaze Your Own Trail, it's an interactive exploration of women's life paths. And so it uses the choose your own journey format, which is ... the choose your own adventure books. And which means that you, the reader, are the person going through the story. And you make a decision at the end of each chapter that tells you where to go to next. So, essentially the whole table of contents is this big decision tree. And there's all these different pathways. There's 19 different endings. 19? Yeah. 19 different endings to a book? Yeah. I have to say that I just finished writing a book myself that will be published hopefully next week or the week after. And I could barely think of one ending, so I can't even imagine what it's like to think of a 19. And it's non-fiction, so it should have been pretty easy. Well, congrats on finishing the book. That's super exciting. - Thank you. Yeah, I think coming from that that product manager background, I think thinking ... becomes kind of natural. ... But yeah, it was really fun. It's really, it's trying to create the experience of the different decisions we make ... as women. And it weaves a lot of data into it as well. So it is this fictional plot line, but with data really creating that sense of solidarity ... that might feel like they're less common because they don't get talked about as much, but in fact are, there's some really shared experiences in there and you create the solidarity of knowing that we're all going through a lot of similar things and that, while oftentimes the outcomes of our decisions aren't what we necessarily thought we wanted, we can be okay and we can find our happiness through all the different twists and turns. Wow. So how long did this whole process take from this idea of Blaze Your Own Trail until the day that it got published? So, I wrote the first draft in about five months. And around the time, shortly before I was finishing the first draft, is when I signed a contract with my publisher ... And they were amazing. I had my editor there and it was really incredible, and the whole team was really incredible. So, I had a really positive experience with that. So ... 'till it came out, was a year. Now, during that year, I went through all the different editing and rewriting stuff. And then there was a waiting period ... when OwnTrail was born. I started thinking about how I might create what I thought would be a book launch website. Maybe something ... trails that different women have blazed, but it ended up really taking on a life of its own pretty quickly. We really found some important ... and some big ideas for solving them around what mentorship has traditionally looked like and what it could look like if we were able to scale ... I, and countless other women, get asked to go to coffee and share what our journey has been by young women who really want to hear those experiences and get advice. And it just it doesn't scale. We can't say yes to everybody. And oftentimes we, as women, and especially women who hold multiple different ... identities, don't always have people in our immediate purview that look like us and that can be really valuable to see. And so, what we're doing is really creating a scalable platform that is an aggregate of what we call micro acts of mentorship which is women sharing the trail they blazed ... milestones, and we're combining all those trails together to be both this really rich content, stories essentially, but it's all structured by data. So, we're essentially gonna be building out this huge neural network of life paths that can be used to really answer the questions provide the guidance and inspiration that women are looking for when they say they either want to mentor or want to be a mentor. Wow. Okay. So, I have to say first, that reflecting back on this idea of decision making trees and there's sometimes this fear of making certain decisions and the different outcomes it can make. And I reflect back, I'm a huge Broadway fan, and there was a show that I saw quite a few times called If/Then with Idina Menzel. And the whole show was about this character who has to make some lifelong decisions. And the show kept going through different realities and showing what would have happened had she made those different decisions, but the bottom line of the story was that by not making a decision or by being fearful of making a decision, then she was making some of the poorest decisions by not making them in the first place. And she was longing for that mentorship throughout the show. So, talk to me a little bit about this need that OwnTrail is trying to solve. So, I'm understanding the idea that you're creating this big network of different pathways that people have taken. You're creating this community of mentorship where women can seek mentors or they can offer mentorship to others. What is the pain point that you're out there trying to solve that came as an inspiration through Blaze Your Own Trail? I mean, there's kind of two sides of pain points, right, 'cause on one side, it's like we're worrying about our pass through life, we're worrying about how we're gonna get there. We need to see people who look like us in the places we aspire to. And we don't always have that access to that. And honestly, even when you ... mentoring relationship, you're never gonna get everything you need from a single person, right? There's just so many different facets of our lives and different situations ... that it really aggregate inspiration really is so much more powerful. But like that, and then on the flip side is the fact that we want to be able ... coming up behind us, but the traditional ways of doing that just aren't scalable. So I can't say yes to every coffee, even when I prioritize ... And so, what we believe is that traditionally, when women say they want a mentor, they want to be a mentor, they're really saying, I want to be able to solve problems I'm experiencing. And 75% of women we know aren't solving those problems, they aren't giving or getting the mentorship they want. So ... OwnTrails really reframing what mentorship can be in a way that reaches all women, where they are, when they need it. And really both provides the ... of these different life paths, but then also provides the action and the framework to really navigate your own life and figure out where are you going ... through the power of community. What does that mean that 75% of women don't have the mentorship that they need? ... basically from observing them. Like have you, are you getting as much mentorship as you wish you were, or are you finding as much mentorship ... 75% say no, over 75% say no to both of those. And so, what your thesis is that it's a matter of accessibility that by building a community of givers and takers that are obviously each person is playing both sides of the market, right? You're able to create this accessibility network where everybody can get the mentorship that they're looking for. Now, is this mentorship specifically professionally? So, these are professional decision making or is this could be anything? Like I was thinking of going on a maternity leave, but I'm not really sure how my employer is gonna take it. ... I mean the thing is like, and particularly with women, I think our personal professional lives are so inherently intertwined. And platform systems and discussions tend to be siloed into like this is personal versus this is professional. And so, we're really trying to blow that idea open. And so yeah, it is ... It's yes, it's different career obstacles that women have navigated and accomplishments. There's ... or fertility issues. There's mental health. There's grieving. There is self-doubt. There's unhealthy relationships. There's great relationships. And it's really, it's the culmination of all those milestones that really makes up what our real journey looks like, and it's not the perfect linear path that we might have expected. I love it. Okay Rebekah, so two things before we go. First, reflecting back on the incredible experiences you've had. Going to five different colleges, and I'm calling that an incredible experience that probably very few people have. So, and I'm sure that there's a lot to take from there as well. All the way to being VP at Zillow and working there for 15 years to writing a book to your own company. What are some really key takeaways that I could take for myself or for my friends as we are just starting on our journey, right? I mean, I'm just in college now. So, what are some things that I should be keeping in mind that you would recommend for me? I really like this framework that I recommend sometimes to people 'cause it is ... in terms of having your eyes on some faraway vision. And it's really, at any point in your life thinking about what are the things in my life that are giving me the most energy, like where are my passions, what's fueling me, and what am I good at, right. And that's not necessarily like ... or the job titles you've had, but it's like, what are those inherent, Sorry. No worries. What are those inherent ... and where you need it. And sometimes it's as simple as there's this job description and you apply to the job. And sometimes where you're needed is a little bit requires a little more creativity, and you have to see that there's a problem to be solved and you're the person to solve it. But the advice really would be if you triangulate those three things, your skills and your passion and where you're needed, and use that to really guide what you do and where you go next, I think that it will open up some really interesting opportunities and experiences in your life. I love it. Rebekah, right before we go, I want to thank you for being so generous with your time. This was really, really fantastic. I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. Okay. I would say creative. Okay. Excited. I get excited about a lot of ideas. And, well hyphenated word, risk-taker. Creative, excited, and risk-taker. I love it. Rebekah, thank you very, very much. OwnTrail, Blaze Your Own Trail, and you also have a crowdfunding campaign that's active and I believe it has a few days left. Well, by the time that this gets aired, it will already be over, but it'll be successfully over. I think it's like right there, right? It's like right there. Yeah. We're at 95% right now. 95%. Yeah, I would love for everyone listening that identifies as a woman to share your trail at owntrail.com. And everyone listening ... the woman that you know that are inspiring and ask them to do so. And it's a group effort. So, yeah. I love it. Rebekah, thank you very, very much and stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you. You too. Thanks for having me. Thank you.
