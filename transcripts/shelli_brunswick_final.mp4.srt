1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,079
Life is a journey,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,199
and you want to be excited

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,599
about what you're doing,

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,999
so find passion in it.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,279
And if you find passion, as they say,

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,220
you'll never work a day in your life.

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,559
Shelli Brunswick,

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,439
thank you for joining me

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,439
on 20 Minute Leaders.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,920
How are you?

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,720
I'm fantastic.

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,200
It's wonderful to join you today.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,400
Thank you for inviting me.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,720
And thank you to your sponsors

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,760
that make this possible.

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,720
Thank you very, very much.

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,680
That's very kind of you.

18
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:52,599
And good morning to you.

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,880
Thank you for taking this

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,360
on an early Sunday morning.

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,880
But we're going to have so much fun.

22
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,160
It's going to be the best Sunday morning

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,240
possible because we're going to talk

24
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,680
all about space, your passion.

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,320
I know practically nothing about space.

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,320
And I'm ultra curious.

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,440
So, I'm excited for this episode.

28
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,200
Shelli, If I were to even start by going

29
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:12,599
through your journey from the Air Force

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,360
all the way to the Space Foundation,

31
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,520
I'm not going to do it justice.

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm going to ask you to briefly

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,160
take me through

34
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,040
your incredible experiences and so that

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,720
we can get into a deeper conversation

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,640
about space and where we're headed.

37
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,960
Well, thank you for that.

38
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,880
I always like to say

39
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,320
my journey has had three chapters.

40
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:32,519
And that first chapter

41
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,560
was right out of high school.

42
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,960
I enlisted in the US Air Force

43
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,880
and I was stationed in Europe.

44
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,280
And so I got to experience new cultures,

45
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,000
new people, new ideas.

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,560
And while I was working during the day,

47
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,040
I was a personnel office specialist.

48
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,240
So, HR, and at night I went to school.

49
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,920
So, I completed my bachelor's degree

50
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,080
going to school at night.

51
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,360
And after being enlisted for 12 years,

52
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,760
I applied and was selected

53
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,800
to become a Air Force officer.

54
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,520
So, that started my second journey.

55
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,880
And that's when I transitioned

56
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,880
into the aerospace and space industry.

57
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,360
Because I was stationed

58
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,280
at the Space and Missile Systems Center

59
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,480
in Los Angeles

60
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,760
and I became a space project manager.

61
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,600
So, that was really my start.

62
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,120
And then from there,

63
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,240
I had jobs working

64
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,840
at the Space and Missile System Center,

65
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,080
learning all about ground stations

66
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,080
and launch vehicles and on orbit assets.

67
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,120
And then I went and worked

68
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,280
at Defense Acquisition University.

69
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,720
I was a professor

70
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,520
teaching about space acquisition.

71
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,160
And then my final

72
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,280
assignment in the Air Force.

73
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,200
I was stationed on Capitol Hill

74
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,520
where I was a congressional budget

75
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,320
and appropriations liaison,

76
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,160
securing the budget for the Air Force,

77
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,760
as well as the space

78
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,720
portion of that budget,

79
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,080
and then answering questions

80
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,880
and helping everyone understand

81
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,240
the importance of space to our future.

82
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,200
And then, so that ends my second chapter.

83
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,840
And obviously, you know a little bit

84
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,520
about my third chapter,

85
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,760
and that's where I am today,

86
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,560
working at the Space Foundation

87
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,240
as the chief operating officer

88
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,600
and are executive leader for our Center

89
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,080
for Innovation and Education.

90
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080
That's just remarkable.

91
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,800
One of the things that you mentioned was,

92
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,760
it sounds to resonate across your career

93
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,760
is what part of your role was also

94
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,720
explaining the importance of space

95
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,440
and how people can interact

96
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,720
with such a weird subject.

97
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,880
I mean,

98
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,800
99% of the things that we deal with

99
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,160
are here on Earth, and all of a sudden

100
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,000
we're dealing with things

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,440
that we can't even see,

102
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,120
feel or touch or hear.

103
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,080
And one of the things that we brought up

104
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,920
in our earlier discussion was how

105
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,640
a lot of people view space as

106
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,000
sort of like a black box. Right?

107
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,720
And as an engineer, when I get introduced

108
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,240
to a lot of code that sometimes

109
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,080
it's very complicated,

110
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,080
somebody else wrote it

111
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,400
and I just accepted it as it is.

112
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,120
And I'm too afraid

113
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,520
to even get into it and touch it

114
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,520
because it's so messy and complicated.

115
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,320
And I think that for me and my friends,

116
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,160
space is like that in some level.

117
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,320
It's too obscure,

118
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,240
it's too complicated out there.

119
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,200
So, maybe dumbed down a little bit for me

120
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,440
and talk to me a little bit about

121
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,560
what space really is all about.

122
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,680
Well, that's one of the

123
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,240
misperceptions about space.

124
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,080
There are three real misperceptions.

125
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,840
One is the technology piece of it.

126
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,880
Many people think about Elon Musk

127
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,640
and Jeff Bezos and launch vehicles

128
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:12,919
and satellites, and that is certainly

129
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,959
a part of the space industry.

130
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,959
But I read about your background as well,

131
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,920
and you're very sophisticated and smart

132
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:19,999
and you're doing a lot of things

133
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,599
that directly relate to space.

134
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,319
Because space is about

135
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,959
the Internet of things:

136
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,120
financial industry, agriculture,

137
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,320
health care, pharmaceuticals,

138
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,280
public safety, transportation,

139
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,560
communications.

140
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,800
There are 16 different technology sectors

141
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,000
that relate to the space industry.

142
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,400
And we're using them every day.

143
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,000
We're using it right now.

144
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,520
When we get down

145
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,440
we probably all going to look

146
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,400
at our cell phone.

147
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,920
Technology in your cell phone

148
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,800
came from the space industry.

149
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,560
And I share with you

150
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,480
two awesome

151
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,160
companies went public

152
00:04:50,161 --> 00:04:52,279
and that was Uber Eats,

153
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,999
or DoorDash and Airbnb.

154
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,679
Again, two great companies

155
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,000
that are using space technology

156
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,960
to create a company.

157
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,720
So, when you think about it,

158
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,760
don't think about it like

159
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,999
this is space and it's a black box.

160
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,280
Think about it as,

161
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,592
how can I take this

162
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:11,439
this capability, this infrastructure

163
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,120
and how can I use it to unlock value,

164
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,480
release innovation and technology

165
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,920
to help better our lives on Earth.

166
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,560
So, I hope that helped a little bit.

167
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,760
And how exciting space is

168
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,720
and what really the space economy is.

169
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,400
So, Shelli,

170
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,040
why are you so passionate about space?

171
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,440
Why joined the Air Force

172
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,200
out of high school?

173
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,720
Why continue on the path?

174
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,040
And, you know,

175
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,120
you're touching the skies

176
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,640
with the airplane

177
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,160
and then you decide

178
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,400
to go even higher to space.

179
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,920
Why? Why even do that?

180
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,800
Why go that route?

181
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,600
Well, I have a value system that was

182
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,760
instilled from a very early age.

183
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,160
My grandmother, my mother, my aunts

184
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,480
we all come from a family of,

185
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,640
we really work hard,

186
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,600
we believe in doing what's right.

187
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:56,679
Integrity first, service before self.

188
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,359
And those are exactly the same traits

189
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,999
that the US Air Force has.

190
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,040
So, it was a natural path for me

191
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,839
to go into the Air Force.

192
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,159
I initially didn't think

193
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,120
I'd stay almost 30 years.

194
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,560
But I just loved what I was doing

195
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:11,319
and I'm passionate about everything I do.

196
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,559
I mean, life is a journey

197
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,679
and you want to be excited

198
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,080
about what you're doing.

199
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:17,479
So, find passion in it.

200
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,759
And if you find passion, as they say,

201
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,679
you'll never work a day in your life.

202
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,279
So, I love what I do.

203
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,439
I think the biggest piece for me is

204
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,159
I look at all the individuals that maybe

205
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,919
are not part of the space economy

206
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,000
and I highlight,

207
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:34,079
we have room for everyone.

208
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,760
Whether it's high school diploma, the PhD,

209
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,400
there's an opportunity for everyone

210
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,960
to be part of the space economy.

211
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,160
Talk to me a little bit about

212
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,000
where we are today, because I think

213
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,520
one of the remarkable things

214
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,000
that we've seen

215
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,520
in the past year or two is this explosion

216
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,440
of innovation and excitement

217
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,960
over what's been happening with space.

218
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,240
I know hundreds of thousands

219
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,680
are tuning in, live, practically daily

220
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,560
for the Space X launches.

221
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,400
Jeff Bezos has company Origins just

222
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,800
announced a partnership with NASA, right,

223
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,880
to deploy things to space.

224
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,360
So, where are we today in terms of either

225
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,120
space exploration or space technology?

226
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,280
You know, just to give me

227
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,000
a little bit of taste

228
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,480
so that I can get excited about it.

229
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,000
Awesome.

230
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,960
Well, let me give you

231
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,200
a little bit of taste.

232
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,040
I'm sure you're very familiar with GPS.

233
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,760
And when people think about GPS,

234
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,280
they think about airplanes

235
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,520
and they think about cars

236
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,320
and how do we get

237
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,880
from one place to the other.

238
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,440
But since 1983, GPS has unlocked

239
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,960
one point three trillion dollars

240
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,840
of value to our economy.

241
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,000
That's jobs.

242
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,280
That's economic opportunity.

243
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,400
And again, I shared with you

244
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,280
a couple of companies

245
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,840
that have just gone public

246
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,240
that are using space technology

247
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,920
to create a business.

248
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,160
So, get excited about that

249
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,360
because the other great part of GPS

250
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
is that was an investment

251
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:52,759
by the US government.

252
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,360
So, that infrastructure

253
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
was courtesy of the US government.

254
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,760
Anybody, anywhere in the world

255
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,200
can use GPS now to create a business

256
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,600
and be an entrepreneur.

257
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,280
The other great thing is,

258
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,440
the NASA Technology Transfer Office

259
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,240
has thousands of patents

260
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
that are waiting for entrepreneurs

261
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,960
to bring to market water purification,

262
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,840
growing food in austere conditions,

263
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:17,359
communications,

264
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,240
battery and storage technology.

265
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,360
So, you can go to the NASA

266
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,120
Technology Transfer Office.

267
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,840
And if you don't have an idea

268
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,960
on being an entrepreneur, you can take

269
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,400
and apply for one of their patents.

270
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,360
They also have seed money

271
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,080
to help you get started.

272
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,040
So, again, space technology

273
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,000
solves problems here on Earth

274
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,680
and makes our lives better.

275
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,800
And for anybody,

276
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,160
any of your listeners in Europe,

277
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,960
also, the European Space Agency

278
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,160
has the same thing,

279
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,720
the Technology Transfer Office.

280
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,720
So, if you want to be an entrepreneur

281
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,120
and you don't currently have an idea,

282
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
most entrepreneurs kind of have an idea,

283
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,880
you can go to either of those websites

284
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,040
and find a patent

285
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,360
and try to bring it public

286
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,360
and solve problems here on Earth.

287
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,480
I think that's just fascinating.

288
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,560
Because so many times

289
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,120
I'm watching my friends

290
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,200
go through this

291
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,520
really difficult ideation process

292
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,800
where they're sitting down thinking,

293
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,280
what can I invent or what can I do

294
00:09:12,281 --> 00:09:13,839
to make a positive impact?

295
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,720
And even if I do think

296
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,520
I can make an impact,

297
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,120
can I even invent the technology

298
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,159
to go and do that,

299
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,880
let alone ready a patent about it?

300
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,120
And just hearing that you have

301
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,600
this obviously phenomenal agency

302
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,200
of superstars

303
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,600
that have already thought of,

304
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,760
these really obscure

305
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
and weird problems to solve,

306
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,480
such as water purification,

307
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,880
growing food on austere places,

308
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,640
and there might be open to you

309
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,760
in coming and making it

310
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,760
and productizing it

311
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,280
and making a business out of it.

312
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,320
I have to go check it out

313
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,400
because it's super, super cool.

314
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,280
But I have to ask, Shelli,

315
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,720
along your career did you anticipate

316
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,240
that you're going to become a space woman

317
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,360
and such a strong advocate?

318
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,680
You know, going to Capitol Hill

319
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,760
and advocating

320
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,760
for either its funding or support,

321
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,320
is this a path

322
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,560
that you imagined for yourself?

323
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,360
I would never have

324
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,720
imagined this for myself.

325
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,560
You have to remember,

326
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,120
when I started over 30 years ago,

327
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,000
the space industry was very different

328
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,120
than it is today.

329
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,160
When I started,

330
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,120
you work for the government

331
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,880
and it was really a few,

332
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,280
only a few countries

333
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,960
even had space programs.

334
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,000
And it was really about outer space.

335
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,520
Low earth orbit with

336
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,360
where the shuttle is,

337
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,080
satellites, ground stations.

338
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,120
Since the 80s, just to now

339
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,680
you can see the commercialization.

340
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,920
And it started with the right legislation

341
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
that allowed commercialization

342
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,520
of launch vehicles.

343
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,680
But it also showed

344
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,760
all this other technology.

345
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,080
And so, we've gone from a few countries

346
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,760
to over 80 countries are now part

347
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,640
of the space economy

348
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,440
and that's continuing to grow.

349
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,000
And it went from

350
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,480
where you work for the government

351
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,200
or maybe a large company

352
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,640
that works for the government

353
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,480
to now you can be an entrepreneur

354
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,840
and bring products to market yourself.

355
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,480
So, we've seen this democratization,

356
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,760
and the opportunity, again, for everyone

357
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,720
to be part of this space economy.

358
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:02,439
So, it's an exciting time for me.

359
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,799
There's no way little ShelLi Brunswick

360
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,959
could have imagined this,

361
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,159
but I'm excited and I look forward

362
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,559
to whatever the next thing is.

363
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,159
When people say,

364
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,440
"What do you think the next thing is?"

365
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,280
It's like, who could ever thought

366
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,480
GPS would be what it is today?

367
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,120
And so, it's exciting.

368
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,880
No, no, no.

369
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,800
That's just phenomenal.

370
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,720
So, Shelli, all of that

371
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,520
sounds super exciting.

372
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,880
And I never pictured,

373
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,680
and when I think of all

374
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,480
the different paths

375
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,760
that my career could take me,

376
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,480
I don't think that I

377
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,160
even considered space

378
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,680
as a viable option.

379
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,240
I think that, growing up as a teen,

380
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,760
a lot of the times

381
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,800
when we talk about space,

382
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,960
we immediately thought

383
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,080
of the connotation of being an astronaut.

384
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:42,879
And I remember that when I watched

385
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,560
the movie Hidden Figures, which I'm sure

386
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,240
that you're very familiar with,

387
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,480
I think it really transformed my thinking

388
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,080
about what different opportunities

389
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,680
there are to be as a scientist

390
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,000
and not necessarily as

391
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,880
as the athlete scientist

392
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,720
that is going up in the space shuttle.

393
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,680
And now, I'm definitely reconsidering

394
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,920
a lot of different paths

395
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,520
that I could take.

396
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,920
But Shelli, I'd love for you to tell me

397
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,600
a little bit about where we're headed.

398
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,640
What are the next steps

399
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,200
in either space exploration discovery,

400
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,720
scientifically speaking?

401
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,600
And what can I get excited about

402
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,400
for the next 10 years or so?

403
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,280
Well, it's really exciting.

404
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,920
What I do want to share is

405
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,560
the space economy is currently

406
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,320
424 billion dollars.

407
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,600
And that's projected to grow

408
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,240
one to three trillion dollars by 2040.

409
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,160
And Bank of America came out last month

410
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,720
and said they're predicting

411
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,080
the global space economy

412
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,920
to be one point three trillion dollars

413
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,440
by 2030.

414
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,160
So, there's lots of opportunity.

415
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,040
And that growth, again,

416
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
is not just going to be

417
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,880
in the launch vehicles and satellites.

418
00:12:41,881 --> 00:12:43,519
It's going to be here on Earth

419
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,760
with data analytics and cyber

420
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,000
and miniaturization of technology

421
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,680
and advanced manufacturing

422
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,280
and health care.

423
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,000
So, you're going to see

424
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,720
this awesome explosion,

425
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,080
we'll use that term,

426
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,880
of space technology

427
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,960
being used in our daily life

428
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,160
here on Earth.

429
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,000
The Space Foundation

430
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
has a program we call

431
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,200
Space Technology Hall of Fame.

432
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,000
And every year

433
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,480
we recognize space technology

434
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,280
that has been commercialized

435
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,720
to help human beings on Earth.

436
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,120
This year we recognize telehealth,

437
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,040
telecommunications and teleconferencing.

438
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,400
All technology that came

439
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,960
from the space program

440
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,160
that has made this year of covid

441
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,960
even achievable.

442
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,920
Because when you think about health care

443
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,360
and communications,

444
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,280
without those forms of space technology,

445
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,480
this year of covid would have been

446
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,680
very, very challenging,

447
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,280
even more challenging than it is now.

448
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,600
And it is extremely challenging

449
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,440
for many folks.

450
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,760
I couldn't even imagine what would happen

451
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,320
if covid had broken out even

452
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,600
in the early 2000s, or even 10 years ago.

453
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:47,880
Right?

454
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,720
I mean, a lot of our ability to adapt

455
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,760
and to maintain to some degree,

456
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,200
our daily routine work,

457
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,640
work-life balance and family habits

458
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,200
are due to these technologies.

459
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,760
And so, it's very remarkable.

460
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,440
Tell me a little bit about

461
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,520
the Space Foundation

462
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
and your work over there.

463
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,000
Besides everything that we talked about,

464
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,120
you're also a role model

465
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,080
for so many women, whether it's through

466
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,240
the awards you received

467
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,360
or your mentorship

468
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,960
in the different programs

469
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,240
like Space4Women, I believe.

470
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,040
Right?

471
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,600
So, I would love to hear a little bit

472
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,160
about your work as a mentor,

473
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,360
but also as part of the Space Foundation.

474
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,160
Well, wonderful.

475
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,840
One of the activities I lead

476
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,280
at the Space Foundation is our

477
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,680
Center for Innovation and Education.

478
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,800
And that is all about

479
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,200
creative, inclusive,

480
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,760
sustainable programs

481
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,160
for workforce development

482
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,800
and economic opportunity.

483
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,560
So, all individuals can find their place

484
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,640
in the space economy.

485
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,120
And again, I shared with you

486
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,000
that's the entire workforce pipeline.

487
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,640
K through 12, teaching teachers,

488
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,520
reskilling the workforce

489
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,920
and then entrepreneurship.

490
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,880
So, we're looking at the

491
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,760
entire workforce pipeline

492
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,560
because to grow that space economy

493
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,640
one to three trillion dollars,

494
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,040
we need everybody to look at space

495
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,160
as a real opportunity.

496
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,560
So, that's why I'm out here

497
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,520
talking with you today

498
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,920
and thank you for giving me this chance

499
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,000
to get that awareness out there.

500
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,800
That space is possible for everyone.

501
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,160
We can help you find your way

502
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,960
into the space economy.

503
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,320
And then, we do have

504
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,920
a workforce development roadmap.

505
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,200
Awareness is number one,

506
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,560
which we're doing today.

507
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,320
Access, I just shared with you

508
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,400
one access point.

509
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,960
You know people

510
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,040
who want to be entrepreneurs, but maybe

511
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,520
are looking for that idea,

512
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,240
go to that NASA

513
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,880
Technology Transfer Office.

514
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,200
The third one is, even if you have

515
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,560
the desire to be in space,

516
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,840
you do have to have the right training,

517
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,200
whether that's a certificate

518
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,560
in advanced manufacturing

519
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,120
or cybersecurity

520
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,520
or data analytics or a PhD,

521
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,120
like you said, from Hidden Figures.

522
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,960
And then, you want to connect.

523
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,760
You want to connect

524
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,240
with like minded individuals,

525
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,400
join organizations

526
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,200
like the ones you mentioned.

527
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,400
WomenTech Network,

528
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,520
that's the organization

529
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,520
that I was honored to receive the

530
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,960
Diversity and Inclusion Officer/

531
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,480
Role Model of the year from.

532
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,040
They have a mentorship program.

533
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,640
The UN Office of Outer Space Affairs,

534
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:06,039
Space4Women,

535
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,559
I'm one of 35 women around the globe

536
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,159
that's part of that program.

537
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,639
And again, it's about mentorship

538
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,039
and connecting.

539
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,199
There's other programs,

540
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,279
Space Generation Advisory Council.

541
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,600
So, look for organizations

542
00:16:18,601 --> 00:16:19,959
where you can connect.

543
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,639
And then the last step is

544
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,959
look for a mentor and be a mentor.

545
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,199
Because no matter where you are

546
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,000
in your career,

547
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,840
you can mentor someone else

548
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,720
and you can always look to be mentored

549
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,000
and coached as well

550
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,400
so that we can ultimately

551
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,159
reach our true actualization

552
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,560
of service before self and helping

553
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,240
to contribute to the greater good.

554
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,840
So, that tells you a little bit about

555
00:16:41,841 --> 00:16:43,359
the Space Foundation and our

556
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,680
Center for Innovation Education,

557
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,240
as well as a couple of those programs

558
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,200
that I'm involved and that you mentioned.

559
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,920
I think that's wonderful, Shelli.

560
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,760
Thank you for sharing that.

561
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,400
What is the one biggest challenge

562
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,160
that you foresee us having with space?

563
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,560
Whether it's in education,

564
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,120
it's in the workforce,

565
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,040
whether it's, you know,

566
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,000
one of the things that I'm thinking

567
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,720
about is a lot of people are talking

568
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,400
that if a couple of hundred years,

569
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,080
we might actually be living

570
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,280
in a different planet.

571
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:11,999
How is the world today going to impact

572
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,920
as the government

573
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,680
as we see it in the future?

574
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,920
We see different countries

575
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,880
looking at different interests.

576
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,920
And I'm always curious about

577
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,720
who's thinking about this stuff?

578
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,960
You know, who's thinking about

579
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,920
whether my great grandkids

580
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,320
are going to be a part of government XY,

581
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,000
or whether it will be an anarchy?

582
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,280
Right?

583
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,040
So, those are great questions.

584
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,840
And the biggest challenge I see

585
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,680
that's immediately impacting us

586
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,840
as we look to grow in the space economy

587
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,600
in the next 10 to 20 years

588
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,720
is really that workforce.

589
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,680
Do we have the right individuals.

590
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,440
We have a skills deficit.

591
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,280
We have that innovation gap.

592
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,680
And we have a workforce shortage.

593
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,600
So, as I shared with you,

594
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,240
there are a lot of great opportunities

595
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,560
in the space economy.

596
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,480
We can't find enough workers.

597
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,520
And so, what that means is

598
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,360
some of the workers we have in the US,

599
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,520
maybe they're in inner cities

600
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,600
or rural communities

601
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,720
or they've never thought about

602
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,720
being part of the space economy.

603
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,920
We need to inspire them

604
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,160
to look for opportunities

605
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,760
to join the space economy.

606
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,000
During covid right now,

607
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,280
individuals to get recertified,

608
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:14,800
they could go through

609
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,160
a certificate program

610
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,200
and go into the manufacturing sector,

611
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,320
data analytics, cyber.

612
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,840
But right now we need that workforce.

613
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,000
And then we have, like I said,

614
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,200
the skills mismatch.

615
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,400
We have individuals

616
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,920
that are looking for jobs

617
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:28,319
and we have jobs available

618
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,800
in the space sector

619
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,920
in all those different industries.

620
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,520
But we have a mismatch of skills.

621
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,840
So, we really need to look at it.

622
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,000
And the Space Foundation

623
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,040
is one organization

624
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,960
that's out there talking about it,

625
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,920
but we really have to work together

626
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,720
to solve it.

627
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,680
Government, public private partnerships,

628
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:45,959
together we can work on

629
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,600
solving these challenges.

630
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,160
And then, of course,

631
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,720
as I shared that innovation gap,

632
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:52,199
we need entrepreneurs

633
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,120
who want to take that risk

634
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,320
and bring technology forward,

635
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,680
not only to create a job for themselves,

636
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,440
but to create jobs for others

637
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,000
and benefit humanity.

638
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,120
100%.

639
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,640
One of the things that

640
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,920
I'm seeing a pattern here

641
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,280
is this understanding

642
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,400
we're educating the market

643
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,280
in some sense, right?

644
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,800
When you're starting a new company,

645
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,160
when Airbnb started

646
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,320
using space technology, of course,

647
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,760
and they wanted people

648
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,400
to rent their houses

649
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,480
when they're not there,

650
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,040
they were really educating the market

651
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,160
with a new perception

652
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,480
and new thinking process.

653
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,400
Because previously it seems weird.

654
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,040
What? I'm going to let somebody else

655
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,880
live in my apartment while I'm away?

656
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,600
Or, I'm going to sleep

657
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,280
in somebody else's apartment.

658
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,120
Here, it sounds like

659
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,240
there's a similar challenge.

660
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,040
Where we have, you know,

661
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,240
a generation that needs,

662
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,520
the space workforce needs them.

663
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,200
But there is this misconception of

664
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,440
are we able to actually be

665
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,840
part of this workforce.

666
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,400
And it sounds to me like, yes, we are.

667
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,080
And now the question is,

668
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,800
how do we educate the market?

669
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,520
How do you think we should go?

670
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,600
Is this already

671
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,240
of the elementary middle school age?

672
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,160
Is it more the college level?

673
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,000
What's the sort of the thinking process

674
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,880
of getting this education?

675
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
Excellent. It's actually

676
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,400
the entire workforce pipeline.

677
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,960
So, you're right.

678
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,560
We need to look at kids

679
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,760
as young as possible.

680
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,840
Especially girls and minorities

681
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,080
who sometimes self eliminate

682
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,720
in middle school from thinking about

683
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,400
going into technology or space.

684
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,120
They don't see that

685
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,320
as a realistic career choice.

686
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,280
So, it's about taking

687
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,800
space inspired education

688
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,120
and putting it in the classroom.

689
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,040
And that's one of the things

690
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,840
the Space Foundation does through our

691
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,320
Center for Innovation Education is

692
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,400
we create space inspired education.

693
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,040
And we do a teacher training program

694
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,560
so that teachers can help coach

695
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,560
and mentor kids to stay on that track

696
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,440
so that they can go

697
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,920
into the space economy

698
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,560
in a variety of different areas.

699
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,400
And then we also, as I shared with you,

700
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,840
it's reskilling and upskilling.

701
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,720
So, we talk to various

702
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,000
workforce centers around the country

703
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,760
and talk about the importance of space

704
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,520
and how they can look

705
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,960
at training programs

706
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,240
with community colleges,

707
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,800
with universities

708
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,760
to reskill the workforce

709
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,840
as workers may be displaced by jobs

710
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,080
that are being automated,

711
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,440
as technology replaces workers.

712
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,200
And how they can have a great job

713
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,160
in the space economy.

714
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,920
And on average,

715
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,240
the jobs in the space economy

716
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,360
pay 40% above the median income

717
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,560
here in the US.

718
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,600
And then, of course, it's about

719
00:21:14,601 --> 00:21:16,959
inspiring entrepreneurship.

720
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,320
We have many entrepreneurs

721
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,040
that are women or minorities,

722
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
but many times they don't think about,

723
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,320
"I could be a space entrepreneur".

724
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,240
And so, again, it's about

725
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,520
breaking down that perception that

726
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,040
everyone can have an opportunity

727
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
to be an entrepreneur

728
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,560
in the space economy.

729
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,400
Whether that's food service,

730
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,320
fleet maintenance

731
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,920
services provided through accounting, IT,

732
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,800
all the way up to PhDs

733
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,600
and mathematicians.

734
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,120
There's an opportunity.

735
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,400
And some of the programs we've done

736
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,040
at the Space Foundation

737
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,720
specifically do just that.

738
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:50,039
We have a junior space

739
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,800
entrepreneurship program

740
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,480
to inspire middle school

741
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,760
and high school kids

742
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:56,439
to look at being entrepreneurs

743
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,000
and taking space technology to market.

744
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,160
We also have our

745
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,400
Space Commerce Entrepreneurship Program,

746
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
which is for adults,

747
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,560
for entrepreneurs to look at,

748
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,720
how do I find an idea?

749
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,640
I can go to the NASA

750
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,400
Technology Transfer Office.

751
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,560
Or do I have a business

752
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,720
but I want to create another line

753
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,400
that I can sell to the aerospace

754
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,920
and space industry.

755
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,240
And so, we help them walk through

756
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,080
what is it to create

757
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,280
another line of business

758
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,680
or to be start a new company.

759
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,720
So again, it's that entire workforce.

760
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,120
There's a place for everyone.

761
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,160
And we have to be, as you said,

762
00:22:28,161 --> 00:22:29,999
breaking down those barriers

763
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,239
that prevent individuals

764
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,120
from thinking about joining us

765
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
in the space industry.

766
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,680
Shelli, it's inspiring

767
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,360
and it makes so much sense.

768
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,720
And I'm definitely have to do

769
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,800
some rethinking on my own

770
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,960
on how I can be a part

771
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,600
of this space economy.

772
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,200
Because it just sounds like, you know,

773
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,960
first of all,

774
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,920
I probably am a part of the space economy

775
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,360
in one way or another,

776
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,880
just by virtue of being

777
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,000
in all those other industries

778
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,520
that we mentioned

779
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,320
in the beginning of this episode.

780
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,720
But I'm excited to take

781
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,800
a more active step

782
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
and re-educate myself

783
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,080
about what it means to be

784
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,760
to potentially be

785
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,800
a part of this workforce

786
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,000
or be a space entrepreneur.

787
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,880
Who knows.

788
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,720
So thank you very much

789
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,640
for this inspiration.

790
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,080
It was phenomenal talking to you.

791
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,040
I know how busy you are.

792
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,760
So, thank you for being

793
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,240
so generous with your time.

794
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,200
And I have to ask you

795
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,400
the most difficult question,

796
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,520
which is three words that you would use

797
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,400
to describe yourself.

798
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,880
I think I said them a few times

799
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,080
during the podcast.

800
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,440
But obviously inspirational.

801
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,280
We need to inspire other individuals

802
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,920
to join us in the space economy.

803
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,560
So, I would say

804
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,080
I strive to be inspirational.

805
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,000
Innovative.

806
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,920
It's all about new technology

807
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,520
benefiting life here on Earth.

808
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,520
So, I believe innovation.

809
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,280
And then obviously, agile.

810
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,760
The first two are great

811
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,360
being inspirational and innovative.

812
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,440
But you got to be agile

813
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,720
and you got to get out there

814
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,000
and get it done.

815
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,400
And if you're not successful

816
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,160
the first time, get after it again.

817
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,000
So, those would be the three ways

818
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:52,999
I describe myself.

819
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,599
And I would describe you as

820
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,279
you are part of the space economy.

821
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,039
And I'm grateful for the contributions

822
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,199
you're making to make

823
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,159
space a better place

824
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,279
for everyone here on Earth.

825
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,240
Thank you very much.

826
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,840
I appreciate that very much.

827
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
So, Shelly, thank you.

828
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,080
Stay safe and stay healthy.

829
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,840
And hopefully we'll see each other

830
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,600
in space one day.

831
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,400
I look forward to it.

832
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,040
I'll meet you on Mars.

833
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,960
Definitely.

834
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,040
Thank you very, very much.
