1 Chana Kanzen, thank you so much for joining me. How are you? I'm very well, thank you. I know you're extremely extremely busy. So, thank you for taking the time to do this. You're the CEO of Jewish Interactive, a non-profit organization, very successful non-profit organization. But you're an educator at heart. A teacher by profession. And you have your own views on education and what needs to happen in order to improve education and spread messages to children around the world. Right now, you're focusing on Jewish education, but you're passionate about the broader sense of education and how to do that more effectively. So, I'd love to hear a little bit about your journey. We'll start from there. And we'll talk also, obviously, about Jewish Interactive and what you're doing over there. Sure. So, I've been a teacher for about 20 years. Started teaching every age group from little ones right through to high school. And I've always been really passionate about good education and getting the kids excited. And I feel it's a really important role. And about 10 years ago, I was actually leading a school. I was approached by the current chief rabbi actually in the UK to open up a school. So, I like challenges. And I decided, okay, I'll open up a school. But I wanted it to be a beacon school. I wanted it to be a school that would be a model for other, especially Jewish schools to look at. And we worked really hard. By the way, just for context, when you're saying you're a teacher for 20 years, is this specifically Jewish education or what sort of teaching did you do? No. I was a qualified teacher to general studies. And about halfway through my career, I actually started to work in Jewish schools and realized that, actually, anywhere up to 50% of the day in a Jewish school is devoted to Jewish education. But what I found fascinating was the delivery and actual relevancy of the education for that 50% or 20% or 10% was just not very good. The teachers weren't always qualified or they didn't have good resources. And I found that quite disturbing, actually, that parents are choosing to send their kids to a school for that reason. And yet the education that was being delivered was not on the same standard. So, I decided to move being a qualified teacher into the Jewish faith to try and up the game. And so, we opened up this Jewish school, the beacon school and it was very exciting. And this was 10 years ago, more actually, about 13 years ago. We started opening a school and smart boards were just coming in. And it's amazing how much things have moved in the past 13 years. But if you think back, we didn't even have iPhones then. It was like really computers. Were just coming into school and it was just the beginning of the technology boom. It was the Facebook. I remember those smart boards, I remember them coming in and slowly being placed in the classrooms. Right. Right. So, because we're new school, we had smart boards in every classroom. It's really cool. And I had great stuff to put on it for math and English, and it came to Jewish studies. And it just really wasn't anything except for some Chabad videos. And I was just thinking, this is crazy. Like there's just no good content for religious education. And in parallel, what's going on is that you've got the world is just going crazy. And religious education is really about mainly morals and inclusivity and living good lives. So, as people most general religions like that. And yet, the way it was being delivered, it was in a very old fashioned paper-based worksheets. So, these kids were experiencing English and math in this really virtual exciting way. And then the religious education was very 2D. And that, for me was a really big problem. And I met this girl who came from South Africa, her name was Nikki Neufeld. And she had this CD that she had made about Shabbat. And she put it in my computer and it was like Disney animation, blew my mind. I haven't seen anything like this before and it's just like, "Where have you been all my life?" "This is exactly what I need." I can't even imagine. Disney animation is about Shabbat. Yeah, it was like this whole animated Disney style. Amazing CD and the amazing story was that she had created this, she wasn't an educator, but she had created the CD on bedrest throughout her pregnancy. She couldn't get up and she had this idea to create digital content and she made this CD. So, she came. And I didn't even watch it. Like she put it in my computer within first seconds, I was like, "I love it." She's like, "But wait, see the rest of it." "I don't need to see anymore." "I want my school to use this." "This is what we need." "But why isn't it online?" "And where is your educational guide?" "And where's your lesson plans?" And I was just grilling her and she was like, "Okay. Okay, I need you to come and work with me." And at that point, I have been in education, formal education all my life, salary jobs, I was training and lecturing and doing all sorts of things. But I never thought about leaving the security of a salary and starting something, especially a non-profit. I had no non-profit background at all. It was a funny story, actually. I remember I went to see a funder to potentially get office space for Jewish Interactive. And she said to me, "So, have you got a boards?" And I said, "So, what's a board?" That's how green I was. Like, I literally did not know anything about what I was doing. I just knew I had this vision. I knew that this is something that needs to be done. So, I have to say already kind of that, a lot of people that are coming on this in the series are the entrepreneurs, investors, a lot of them coming from the tech scene. And over there, going to the tech scene, the route is pretty known that when find the pain point, you raise money, you go build a startup. Now you're coming in, which I think is fascinating as 20 years into education and you're saying that, Okay. While I'm teaching general studies, I'm seeing that there is this gap and the way that Jewish education, it doesn't necessarily have to be Jewish, but in general, there is a gap that a certain segment of education is not receiving, is not getting the quality education that it needs. There's this gap. I'm going to create a school that is going to do this better. And then you find somebody who is actually leveraging technology to actually make this much more interactive. I just think that it's fascinating to draw the parallel because this is pure entrepreneurship right there. It really was. I mean, she basically was almost like an investor. So, she had this trust fund set up that she wanted to devote to developing this. But she didn't have the mechanism. She wanted to pilot it in England because it was a small community. And I happened to be quite good networker and I was networked with all the schools. So, we just gathered or I gathered. I got in contact with all the principals and we did this release and we did this, we just released the product without even having a company. So, basically what we did was we had this whole day and 70 teachers turned up. It was unheard of. Like 70 school appeared and by the end of the day, they were signing checks to Jewish Interactive, which didn't exist. So, I walked away with like $6,000 in checks and no company. Wait. So, were they trying to purchase the product or donations? Yeah. So, we are almost like a social enterprise. So, what we do is we believe in charging for some of our products because we want to bring in revenue, sustainable revenue, but not to make a profit. Any revenue that we bring in goes to the non profit. And also, because the Jewish market is quite small, it's not sustainable. So, most technology, the way that they work is scalability and mass consumption. But even if we reached every single Jewish child in the world, it wouldn't really be profitable. So, we need to tap that non-profit element into it. But at the same time, this was at the beginning of the technology boom, which was having an impact on education. So, I left my job and I started Jewish interactive. But at the same time, I was advocating for different approaches in education because what I could see is I saw something remarkable happen. I walked into my classroom of 30 kids with an iPad and it wasn't even open, and it was like bees to honey. Like all of a sudden I had 30 kids around this iPad with this engagement that I had never seen before with anything else that I did. And if you are a passionate teacher and you want to get something across, then you're going to use the most effective way of doing them. For me, I could see that the levels of concentration and engagement on these devices was just unprecedented. I hadn't seen that before and I thought, "Whatever happens, I have to get my head around this. If I want to get to these kids." Because this is where they're at. And the issue that I then had was years of trying to convince head teachers and teachers that we've got to move this. It's not even debatable. It's not a luxury. So, they perceived technology as this luxury. And even today, you go into classrooms and many classrooms are still paper-based. The kids are writing, handing in their results. They don't get their results 'till two weeks later. And how does that correlate with these kids' day to day experience of instant gratification. There are multiple platforms that accessing huge levels of information and yet the teaching, the education methods have not moved on. So, what's happening are a lot of teachers who haven't moved on are still focused on delivering content and information, which is just not where, the kids don't need to know and be delivered huge amounts of information any more on rote learning. What they need to do is learn how to access the right information. They need to learn how to collaborate, how to access and build relationships, emotional intelligence, all of these other skills that are so vital for jobs today are not being taught. So, what I did, I actually made some connections with Google and Apple and we started to train. We actually had a couple of trainings in Apple headquarters in London for all the Jewish teachers in the UK. And Google helped as well to try and train these teachers in embedding technology into their classroom. And it's not just about having a computer. We can see that now with covid really quickly. Really, it's being actually fascinating for me to watch over the past six months what's happened. Because what's happened in the past six months, I've been advocating for years. And all of a sudden education has moved, I would say, more in the past six months than it has in the past 20 years. It's unbelievable how, now, every single teacher has had experience with online education, whether they like it or not. Some have been really successful and some have been really frustrated and some children have been really successful, and some children have been really frustrated. And I think that it's not about, it's not the technology that's the problem, it's you cannot teach online in the same way that you've been teaching offline. You have to change the pedagogy. And so, that's what I've been trying to do is to change people's approach to education. And instead of just delivering information, changing that whole emphasis unto allowing children to access knowledge and learn and be self directed and creative, which you know, and I suppose most people watching here who are entrepreneurs know that these are essential skills for entrepreneurship which we know. Or any learner in the 21st century, really. Yeah. And quite frankly, with this new generation that's coming up, like these kids, they're going to be graduating in what? 2025, 2030, right? Where is the world going to be that, how many jobs are going to be available. If these kids don't have the skills to be creative and to work in a global way and collaborate, they're not going to be employable. Because all the other jobs aren't going to exist, right? The jobs that the teachers are currently teaching for will not be there. So, unless they have experience in these skills, they're just not going to be able to survive in the world. And school is meant to be priming your children for survival in the world. And it's not being doing that up till now. I think what's happened with covid is that the world is sort of, especially the world of education is having to rethink. It's being forced to rethink. And it's difficult and it's challenging and not everyone's getting it right. But it's necessary. And it's been a really interesting few months to observe this going on in the world and seeing what's working, what isn't. And I think we've definitely hit a turning point. I don't think there's any going back. I think that technology and education is here to stay and we've just got to get our heads around that and make it work. And what been great for me is that I've been privileged to be in a position for the past 10 years where I've been gradually working with a bigger and bigger market. I now work with a global market, with schools all around the world. And so, I'm able to see what works and what doesn't and how they're using platforms. And we're now actually building a new platform, not just for the Jewish world, for everybody. We're building an open source platform so anybody can use it. And the idea of this platform is for teachers to create content and children to learn asynchronously using this content and build the sharing community. And so, we're developing this now. It's really exciting. And it's really a gift to be able to develop this platform during the time of covid when we've got so many teachers who are experiencing challenges and blockages. And we're trying to get that information and then build that into what we're creating. So, it's a very exciting time for us at the moment. Of course. But Chana, then I have to ask so, everything that we've talked about until now, it sounds like it's relevant for all subjects in education and for all teachers and for all students. Why is it Jewish Interactive? Because it sounds like even that experience of having that person come in with a CD and and sharing those lessons about Shabbat in an interactive way, it sounds like the pain point and the solutions you uncovered is something that's relevant for many many other fields, right? So, why specifically in that market? Because you're starting off by also saying that, inherently the Jewish education market is so small that you have to position this as an NGO. Why not take this to a for profit company that is trying to help education all around? It's a really good question. There's a few reasons for that. First of all, the Jewish market needs specific content. And what's very difficult about the Jewish market is there's a saying that: if you have two Jews, you have three opinions. Right? So, the same with all the schools. Every school is unique. So, everyone says, "Why don't you just do like one curriculum on Judaism and then you've got it." And there's been many many people that have made online curriculums about Judaism. So, why do we need to do it? And the answer is that every school has their unique, their USP so to speak, and every school has their own way of delivering that form of education. And that's what makes this school unique and that's why people sending their kids at school. So, what we did was we developed a platform that allows people to create their own content that's personalized to them. Now that is relevant to everybody. You're right. But someone needed to do it for the Jewish market. And because it wasn't profitable, who's going to do that? If you want to start a business and make it profitable, you're not going to do something for the Jewish market. But unless we actually consciously did it, there wouldn't be anyone doing that. So, I had a decision to make, I could either build a profitable business. If I wanted to build a profitable business, I would have to not focus on the Jewish content to make it profitable. And I just decided that I didn't want to do that. I wanted to give to the Jewish world consciously. And in order to do that, I had to make a non-profit. I wasn't going to make profit. And what's actually amazing about this organization is we have the most phenomenally talented people that I've cultivated and brought together amazing amazing team members. And they all feel the same way. They're all doing this out of a social conscious need for the Jewish world. And they're very talented. All of them could work in like Google or Facebook. But they're doing it because they feel there is a need for the Jewish world. So, if you look at other markets like the Islamic market and the Christian market, there are phenomenal phenomenal products. They have much bigger budgets. They have much more people for a start. And they have phenomenal content And the Jewish world just doesn't. So, I mean, there are other organizations that are doing great jobs for high school and beyond. But there wasn't really anyone doing something for the elementary and middle school, and we felt that that was needed. So, it was a conscious decision to actually be a nonprofit to fill a need in the Jewish market. However, you're right. What we are building now, the place that we've got to now, where we're actually building our own platform, is consciously being built for other markets, not just the Jewish market. We've taken our learning because we're quite way a small community. There's only 5,000 Jewish schools in the world and we're working with about a thousand of them already. Really? Yeah. Wow. 20% of the market you're going after. We do. We do. And in over one hundred countries so we can really see the cultural differences and what's happening. We've got a global view of what's happening in education. So, we can take that information to develop this platform and then share it beyond the Jewish market. And at that point, it is possible that we could diversify and form a for profit that will help the non-profit market. But if we wouldn't have focused on the Jewish market, then that would still be the spark here because it isn't profitable. So, it's like a labor of love at the moment. It's something that I wanted to give to the Jewish world. And it's not just me. I wouldn't be where I am today without a phenomenal team, phenomenally talented team who are based in four countries. And an amazing board and phenomenal founders and visionaries who will come together to do this thing. So, it's very exciting. Yeah. That's just unbelievable. Chana, 20 minutes go by way too fast. But this is just inspiring. Incredible, you're in 100 countries. You're in a thousand schools. You're in 20% of the Jewish schools. I mean, that's it. And the whole story is just so entrepreneurial. It's like raw entrepreneurship. It's just that it's very very inspiring. And I wish you best of luck. Thank you for being so generous with your time. Before we finish, I have to ask you the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. Three words I would use to describe myself. So, I think, I have to say an educator. Because I'm passionate about education. I'll use three words in one word, like pushing the boundaries. I like to push. And resilient. I'm very resilient. Which you have to be running a nonprofit, especially in the Jewish world. And I think to be a teacher, you have to be resilient to open a school. You have to be resilient into run a nonprofit, let alone a company, you have to be resilient. Chana, thank you very very much. Consider doing good for the world. And stay safe and stay healthy. My pleasure. Take care Thank you.
