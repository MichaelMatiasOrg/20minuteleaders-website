1 Emna Ghariani, thank you so much for joining me on my 20 Minute Leaders show. How are you? Good. How are you? Fantastic. It's so great to have you here. Some technical issues to start, but that's part of the virtual lifestyle that we have. Unfortunately, we can't be in a studio doing this face to face. We'll settle for this. Emna, we have so much to talk about from your startup Veamly all the way to digital well-being. Let's start off easy and then accelerate as we go along. Who are you Emna Ghariani? All right. Wow, that's a long question. So, I'm the CEO and co-founder of Veamly. Veamly is a unified workspace for developers. Our goal is to help them focus better, stay in flow, remove distractions, so we give them a centralized workspace for their non-coding apps, and we give them a smart feed of their conversations on top. Are you referring to the fact that there are distractions when we are online? Yes. So, the problem is today all of us, even beyond developers, when we open our laptop our cortisol level is high by default, our stress is high, our focus is down just because we have so many tabs open, so many apps, and we get interrupted, yeah We get interrupted every 11 minutes on average and it takes over 20 minutes to focus again. So, when you think about it we're all the time in non-focused mode, and we end up staying late and working over the weekend and burning out and we don't ... second to stop and think pretty much. So, that's why pretty much. Now, is this new? So is this something, if I look at the workforce 50 years ago, people are working everywhere. Is this a new problem that we have? Absolutely. Actually, it's funny you say that, because I always talk about the evolution of communication. So 20 years ago, 50 years is a bit too far we didn't have computers like we do today, at least we didn't use them. We didn't have computers like we do today. So 20 years ago, however, communication used to happen via one, two main channels. Of course, that had a lot of issues like scattered information, silo effects. And in the past few years, we've seen an explosion of collaboration apps and work apps, and now there's literally an app for everything and there is no streamlined process. So, we are here to streamline the process between all these apps and help people better leverage and optimize their time in the hope to help them get to their work-life balance. So, yeah. But what does that even mean? So, how do you go and help people avoid distractions, optimize their time, be more productive in the moment? Very good question. So, for us, what we do in Veamly, so it's a desktop app. So, you have access to all your different apps and top you have your smart feed, but we have a mode where you can go from sync to async. So, when you are in async mode you have no interruptions. You still have your smart inbox being filled up with all your conversations, and then we have a soft alert system to help users understand that they need to look at something, but that they're in flow it's not gonna interrupt them. And then what we do is we bring them awareness on how they're using their time, and we give them insights to help them really educate themselves better. So with Veamly, they get at least an hour back a day. Wow. So, I think that's just fascinating, 'cause as I'm reflecting now on my experience, I'm a software engineer at Hippo Insurance, and I love the experience. And one of the interesting things is that I've noticed that now that everybody's remote and there is no casual meetings, I can't stand up and go meet somebody at the office, my Slack messages that I'm getting I almost feel the responsibility of answering them as if somebody came up to my desk and spoke to me. And that is distracting because as I'm coding or doing something else, I feel compelled to in real time answer everybody. It's not like an email where I feel, okay, it's fine if I take two, three hours because I don't check my email every five seconds, right? So, I love what you're saying because for me, it's very interesting how we as people don't even take a step back to think on why we do that even. Like Slack is not forcing us to go in. But what happened is the notification sound or the color ... makes your brain react before yourself in a way. So, that creates this fake sense of urgency and this also FOMO effect, right, the fear of missing out. So, before you ... it's one of your colleagues sharing a puppy picture and it's not ... everything is fine, you're already distracted, you're already looking at it, you're already interacting with it. Beyond that, you also have your comments on your JIRA tickets and your comments on your ... request and every single thing comes and it's a notification or it's an interruption. And today there is no way to prioritize to know what to focus on or not. And it's very detrimental to your focus, to your flow. And it's stress that we don't even feel. For me, I will say this like there's two types of stress, right? And I'm not scientific or a doctor, but there's the stress that you feel and there's the stress that you don't feel that's living everywhere in your body, in your lower back, in your wrists, everywhere, and you don't realize it's happening. And all these small things contribute to it. Sure. But we're not accounting for them. That's why we talk about ... productivity in that sense. So, yeah. So, what is the actual solution? It's a desktop application that I come in and I go into this new world, this async world, where now a lot of my messages becoming self notifications and smart alert systems. Tell me a little bit more about the experiences that I'll have using that. Yeah, absolutely. As a developer you open Veamly, you have access to your Slack, to your JIRA, to your GitHub. Anytime you need to do actual work in those, you'll access them from there. But on top we have one single pane of glass where it's prioritized for you ... what needs your action and what needs your attention, so immediately you know how to prioritize your time and what to address first. So, everything else that's not a priority right now we'll put it in another tab and you can go look at it later. Also, the way we prioritize is based on the user preferences. So, as they start, they decide what goes into their feed, we're not here to do that. But also we have obviously some algorithms to help prioritize that are, some of them are logical some of them are smart based on behavior and semantics. And so, that's the first level. And then on top of that, they have a unified search where they can search for any information really easily. And, as I mentioned, they have this mode sync versus async, and when they are in async mode, then we have a soft alert system that doesn't interrupt them if they're in flow, but if they're not, then it will let them know there is more stuff to look at. The thing is, an interruption or a distraction is not a bad thing. ... actually proven it was great for creativity. But it's an unplanned distraction or interruption is that's the one that's bad for you. So for us, we help you plan your distractions in a way and prioritize your time while streamlining all your communications. So, give me a little bit of context and a little bit of statistics, because I'm sure that that's something that you've been mixing around. And so, how many notifications does the average developer get, let's say, a day? Or how much time does it waste? You mentioned something earlier. Very good. So people get, developers get at least a hundred messages a day across their different apps. So, this is a combination of Slack messaging. - We're popular. Yeah. And a hundred is a very small number, by the way. It goes by very fast. So, it's a hundred messages between their Slack, messages between their comments on JIRA tickets, between their comments on their ... request, JIRA or whatever other app obviously they're using. Yeah. But their ticketing apps. So, between those, they spend on average two minutes on each. So, that's a total of three hours and 20 minutes a day. And then couple hour meeting, especially in a remote world, that's five hours and 20 minutes. So, theoretically in an eight hour day, that leaves them with an hour and 40 minutes of true focus time, which of course does not happen. Unfortunately, the developer community has always been guilty of not being great at their work-life balance, so they tend to burn out pretty quickly. They don't take days off. They don't put themselves at the forefront. At the same time, every app out there that's about developers, it's all about code. It's not about product, it's not about them as people. So, and for us we're like, we come from that background. We built product, we've seen it, and we want to care about them as people because as they are more balanced, everything else will go even better; more productive, better for the company, better for everybody. So, and that's ... How did you get started with this whole idea? So, before this, I used to run a company doing CPO as a service, so Chief Product Officer as a service. So, I'd act like an interim CPO to non-tech founders, and I'd bring my team of designers and engineers, and then we'd build the product and take it to market depending on the needs of the company. And that's kind of where it hit me, how the way we work is broken. And so, based on my background, I have a lot of background in process optimization and communication and ops in general. So, for me, it was a no brainer to go after this. And before that, I did help launch over 40 startups as a director at The Founder Institute. Wow. So, I've seen the problem elsewhere as well, and that's what got me to, like kind of my path was that way. Like I helped other companies, then I wanted to start my own company, but I wanted to figure out what I needed to solve for the world. And that's kind of how I got there. So, yeah. Right. Digital well-being goes side by side with productivity in the sense that you're trying to understand how people engage with their digital environments, not necessarily to optimize their work productivity, right, or output, but to also maximize their well-being. Talk to me a little bit about that. I don't think I know nearly enough, and I'm just starting out in my own career, so this is definitely something that I want to take with me as I continue my journey as an engineer, but also as an entrepreneur and hopefully leader. Great. So, digital well-being is definitely a combination of different things. The problem is that when we try to throw software at the problem, I mean that was a weird sentence but you get my point, like throwing software as a solution at a problem, like this isn't gonna solve it. I always say this like Veamly, as a software itself, is a band-aid; the true solution is gonna be what comes with it which is what we help people achieve. It's like when you buy a pack of cigarettes and it says smoking kills, that's kind of ... thing to do to educate people on really how distractions and notifications are really killing their day and their life and their well-being. Like, for example, I have been notification free for almost two years now. And everybody's shocked- I'm scared. I'm shocked. Exactly, right. You're scared, you're shocked. And people are like, "How do you do that?" Like how, like you're a CEO, you're running a company, you're doing all these things. And I always challenge people to try it for three days. The first time you feel true withdrawal. Like for me the first time, especially the first three days when I started, I felt like something is missing. Literally, it was almost like a drug. That's how I realized how bad it is even more, right. So, for us, definitely that's at the core of what we're doing in terms of helping people think differently about those. But beyond that, it's the small things that you implement in your day to day that help you do better. So, even being conscious about the problem, disconnecting from screens. like for me, you'll never find my phone next to me, and if you find it next to me, it's always screen down, right. So, it's like getting in the habit of reducing distractions. So, a lot of things enter in making us more productive and more balanced, and that's your sleep quality, your water intake, even the way- Wait wait, before we continue there, I have to go back a little bit because I have to ask. This idea of no notifications as a CEO, at the end, throughout this show and filming over 200 episodes, one of the really interesting things that have been coming up is this idea of being connected and being responsive. A lot of people are really taking responsiveness seriously. And it always amazes me how very, very busy people respond very, very quickly to my emails or my messages. How do you portray yourself as a responsive person and not miss opportunities or allowing people to count on you in a world where you're not even aware necessarily that they're messaging you? So, first, I love this question because earlier in my career, and not that long ago really, I obsessed over responsiveness, especially when it's like somebody qualify as important, whoever that is, right, in your world. It could be your boss or whoever it is. So it's like you're always scared, "Oh, what if I don't answer, and they think I'm careless?" or I'm not, pretty much it's all fear, right? It all comes from fear, at the end of the day. Fear of missing out, fear of being perceived wrong. And the thing is, I always say this even to my team, it's all about intent. That's number one. So, I think we put the wrong weight on responsiveness, because we're not robots. If I'm not responding to you, it means I'm probably doing something else, I'm responsible for ... right. So, if I'm working on a presentation, I'm working on a product thing, I don't need to be responding to you unless it's something super urgent and then you just call me, right, and interrupt me. And so the thing is is you realize that most people don't care if you reply to something within 24 hours, that's when it comes to email, right? When it comes to instant messaging like Slack and other things, like it's a matter of an hour or two which nobody does, unless you are in a collaboration mode. When you're in collaboration mode, you need to schedule that. Like I talk about structured synchronous communication, right. Like there's a whole debate about async versus sync. I'm like sync can be structured, right. I can be in sync mode, that's how we have this feature, and if I'm in sync mode, all my notifications are coming in, but it's fine, 'cause I'm in collaboration mode. So, I never had any issues with responsiveness since I've been notification free, because I still check my different apps on a regular basis, right. If I'm done with a task at hand, then I'm gonna go check my main channels of communication, right. So, which is I use mainly Trello, JIRA, Slack, and email. These are the four main ... for me. So, yeah. And so, when you're running your company now, do all your engineers have to use Veamly to be productive? I hope that for them. They're building it, so if they don't believe in it, we'll have a problem, right? So it not even like, for us, even the whole approach, whether it's our engineers or other engineers out there, the whole point is we're not forcing something on you. We're bringing awareness for you. It's kind of what you said about yourself, right right now. It's like I'm an engineer. I see this as like, yeah, I want you to realize that for yourself and hopefully we help you be more balanced, be more focused and do better, really. 100%. So, back to digital well-being. Go back a little bit to the scope of what's happening today and a little bit of where we can expect to be headed, especially in covid-19 times when things are a little bit tricky. We're not really sure of what's happening, and we're not really sure of our interaction with the virtual environment for years to come. So, this is actually, covid made this problem even more prominent and bigger, because now we don't have a separation between our personal life and our work. Even for me, I've been running remote for years, right. Before this, I have launched companies remotely in different countries. So, but I always made it a point to separate my work environment from my personal home, 'cause it's very hard, right? That's why like one of the advice you get is in order to be balanced, try to have your own space, try to make, create sort of a routine, etc. So, back to this digital well-being aspect of it in this environment we are in, more than ever we need a sense of stopping, creating a separation between our personal life or not. For me, I talk about the sense of accomplishment. I say with Veamly, the whole point is to get you to that sense of accomplishment and remove FOMO. You know things are there for you, so you can see data about how you're using your time, you know what you have accomplished today, you know what you need to be doing tomorrow, everything is there for you, it's not gonna go anywhere. So when you disconnect, you don't have that stress of like, did I miss something, right? So, beyond that is bringing the other external factors. More than ever, taking care of our health and our sleep and all these different things that impact our productivity are important. So, for us, when we talk about that, when achieving digital well-being, is by bringing those within Veamly pretty much. Like how can we give you ergonomic nudges, how can we give you like not just towards how you can improve all these different things about your day, organizing your day like a pro pretty much, in order to get to that balance. And so like I mentioned it goes from, like for me my challenge two years ago was notification free, this year my challenge is tab free. So, at the end of every day to close out all tabs. And that's harder because sometimes you go into a meeting and you forget to go back to do that. So, I'm still not perfect at it, but it's so nice, because it forces me to take just five minutes at the end of every day and make sure I place the different tabs wherever I need to, because 90% of the time you never go back to all these open tabs. But it's just bad habits. So, it takes time. So, that's why it has to be incremental and we have to be kind to ourselves. And to achieve true digital well-being, you need to become aware of how you're spending your time. So, awareness sounds like the number one key, because for every person the implementation will likely be a little bit different fitting to their own personal needs. But give me some more helpful ideas of what I can be doing in my daily life to have better digital well-being. And right now, I have to say it's tough, because I'm in front of the screen sometimes 16, 17 hours a day both as an engineer, but also running this podcast. And it's a lot of screen time, and I want to make sure that I'm approaching this in the healthiest way. So, very good question. So, there are a few things you can start implementing from tomorrow. First, calendar blocking. Sounds like trivial, but it's a very good tool, because calendar blocking, it will help you be more intentional about your time. 'cause awareness is key, but intent is key too. We are opted in by default in our daily lives. When you subscribe to a product, you're opted in by default. In your work, you're opted in by default. You don't take a second to think about how you're organizing all this. So, if you ... 10 minutes every night before the next day or once a week to block your whole week, and to make sure to plug your breaks. Being in front of a computer for 17 hours, like now what? You're very young, right, early in your career. What's gonna happen 20 years from now? ... gonna start having back pains and carpal tunnel and all these bad things, like your eyes are gonna go to hell. So, all these things we're not intentional about them. So, calendar blocking, amazing tool to help you schedule your breaks and realize also be even more focused, because once you have that, then you have that rewarding aspect. That's how our brain works. You have a trigger, and then you have a reward. So you know it's like, Oh, if I'm gonna do this for two hours, I'm gonna take a 30 minute break, and then I'm gonna do something else in that break. Workout or go for a walk or watch something, whatever it is that you like doing. So, that's the number one. Two, sleep sleep sleep. That's super important. We don't give enough weight to the importance of having a good night's sleep. It's important for everything, for our focus but even for our bodies, our health, even our workout routine, diet, everything. So, that's an "easy" one to also schedule part of calendar blocking to be like at this time And it helps to use technology, right? For me, technology is not bad; it's about how you can leverage technology to get to your true digital well-being. Technology is not bad, but it can be misused. Exactly. Right. So, if you have an Alexa or a Google home or ... reminder, put your reminder to go to sleep. It sounds trivial, but put that. Create a sleep routine. Like that's the time you, okay, before sleeping I want to drink water, I want to read 10 pages of a book, and do this thing. Create that routine, and then little by little you'll get back to it. The problem is that we are lost, and we don't know where to get started. That's where it gets really, really hard. So, these are some of the few things you can start with day one. I strongly recommend - I love it. to organize your phone. I know phones are our biggest stressors today. Notifications, also when you have five pages of 90 different apps that you don't use anyway. So, if you take five seconds, if you see my phone screen, I have maybe 10 folders, one that says work tools, one that's a social one, finance. And all these little things then are not too hard to implement. They accumulate, they accumulate. They accumulate, and it will create that incremental change will add up to be something really impactful on you. Emna, this is a wonderful. Thank you for being so generous with your time. Before we leave, I have to ask you for three words that you would use to describe yourself. Communication, process, and data. All around ... So, I'll say that's my holy trifecta. So it's like communication, process, and data, in the middle, people are the center. So, yeah. People are the center. I like that. Emna, thank you very, very much. Best of luck with Veamly. Stay safe and stay healthy, and I love the mission. Thank you very much. Thank you. Take care.
