1 Life is a journey, and you want to be excited about what you're doing, so find passion in it. And if you find passion, as they say, you'll never work a day in your life. Shelli Brunswick, thank you for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? I'm fantastic. It's wonderful to join you today. Thank you for inviting me. And thank you to your sponsors that make this possible. Thank you very, very much. That's very kind of you. And good morning to you. Thank you for taking this on an early Sunday morning. But we're going to have so much fun. It's going to be the best Sunday morning possible because we're going to talk all about space, your passion. I know practically nothing about space. And I'm ultra curious. So, I'm excited for this episode. Shelli, If I were to even start by going through your journey from the Air Force all the way to the Space Foundation, I'm not going to do it justice. I'm going to ask you to briefly take me through your incredible experiences and so that we can get into a deeper conversation about space and where we're headed. Well, thank you for that. I always like to say my journey has had three chapters. And that first chapter was right out of high school. I enlisted in the US Air Force and I was stationed in Europe. And so I got to experience new cultures, new people, new ideas. And while I was working during the day, I was a personnel office specialist. So, HR, and at night I went to school. So, I completed my bachelor's degree going to school at night. And after being enlisted for 12 years, I applied and was selected to become a Air Force officer. So, that started my second journey. And that's when I transitioned into the aerospace and space industry. Because I was stationed at the Space and Missile Systems Center in Los Angeles and I became a space project manager. So, that was really my start. And then from there, I had jobs working at the Space and Missile System Center, learning all about ground stations and launch vehicles and on orbit assets. And then I went and worked at Defense Acquisition University. I was a professor teaching about space acquisition. And then my final assignment in the Air Force. I was stationed on Capitol Hill where I was a congressional budget and appropriations liaison, securing the budget for the Air Force, as well as the space portion of that budget, and then answering questions and helping everyone understand the importance of space to our future. And then, so that ends my second chapter. And obviously, you know a little bit about my third chapter, and that's where I am today, working at the Space Foundation as the chief operating officer and are executive leader for our Center for Innovation and Education. That's just remarkable. One of the things that you mentioned was, it sounds to resonate across your career is what part of your role was also explaining the importance of space and how people can interact with such a weird subject. I mean, 99% of the things that we deal with are here on Earth, and all of a sudden we're dealing with things that we can't even see, feel or touch or hear. And one of the things that we brought up in our earlier discussion was how a lot of people view space as sort of like a black box. Right? And as an engineer, when I get introduced to a lot of code that sometimes it's very complicated, somebody else wrote it and I just accepted it as it is. And I'm too afraid to even get into it and touch it because it's so messy and complicated. And I think that for me and my friends, space is like that in some level. It's too obscure, it's too complicated out there. So, maybe dumbed down a little bit for me and talk to me a little bit about what space really is all about. Well, that's one of the misperceptions about space. There are three real misperceptions. One is the technology piece of it. Many people think about Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and launch vehicles and satellites, and that is certainly a part of the space industry. But I read about your background as well, and you're very sophisticated and smart and you're doing a lot of things that directly relate to space. Because space is about the Internet of things: financial industry, agriculture, health care, pharmaceuticals, public safety, transportation, communications. There are 16 different technology sectors that relate to the space industry. And we're using them every day. We're using it right now. When we get down we probably all going to look at our cell phone. Technology in your cell phone came from the space industry. And I share with you two awesome companies went public and that was Uber Eats, or DoorDash and Airbnb. Again, two great companies that are using space technology to create a company. So, when you think about it, don't think about it like this is space and it's a black box. Think about it as, how can I take this this capability, this infrastructure and how can I use it to unlock value, release innovation and technology to help better our lives on Earth. So, I hope that helped a little bit. And how exciting space is and what really the space economy is. So, Shelli, why are you so passionate about space? Why joined the Air Force out of high school? Why continue on the path? And, you know, you're touching the skies with the airplane and then you decide to go even higher to space. Why? Why even do that? Why go that route? Well, I have a value system that was instilled from a very early age. My grandmother, my mother, my aunts we all come from a family of, we really work hard, we believe in doing what's right. Integrity first, service before self. And those are exactly the same traits that the US Air Force has. So, it was a natural path for me to go into the Air Force. I initially didn't think I'd stay almost 30 years. But I just loved what I was doing and I'm passionate about everything I do. I mean, life is a journey and you want to be excited about what you're doing. So, find passion in it. And if you find passion, as they say, you'll never work a day in your life. So, I love what I do. I think the biggest piece for me is I look at all the individuals that maybe are not part of the space economy and I highlight, we have room for everyone. Whether it's high school diploma, the PhD, there's an opportunity for everyone to be part of the space economy. Talk to me a little bit about where we are today, because I think one of the remarkable things that we've seen in the past year or two is this explosion of innovation and excitement over what's been happening with space. I know hundreds of thousands are tuning in, live, practically daily for the Space X launches. Jeff Bezos has company Origins just announced a partnership with NASA, right, to deploy things to space. So, where are we today in terms of either space exploration or space technology? You know, just to give me a little bit of taste so that I can get excited about it. Awesome. Well, let me give you a little bit of taste. I'm sure you're very familiar with GPS. And when people think about GPS, they think about airplanes and they think about cars and how do we get from one place to the other. But since 1983, GPS has unlocked one point three trillion dollars of value to our economy. That's jobs. That's economic opportunity. And again, I shared with you a couple of companies that have just gone public that are using space technology to create a business. So, get excited about that because the other great part of GPS is that was an investment by the US government. So, that infrastructure was courtesy of the US government. Anybody, anywhere in the world can use GPS now to create a business and be an entrepreneur. The other great thing is, the NASA Technology Transfer Office has thousands of patents that are waiting for entrepreneurs to bring to market water purification, growing food in austere conditions, communications, battery and storage technology. So, you can go to the NASA Technology Transfer Office. And if you don't have an idea on being an entrepreneur, you can take and apply for one of their patents. They also have seed money to help you get started. So, again, space technology solves problems here on Earth and makes our lives better. And for anybody, any of your listeners in Europe, also, the European Space Agency has the same thing, the Technology Transfer Office. So, if you want to be an entrepreneur and you don't currently have an idea, most entrepreneurs kind of have an idea, you can go to either of those websites and find a patent and try to bring it public and solve problems here on Earth. I think that's just fascinating. Because so many times I'm watching my friends go through this really difficult ideation process where they're sitting down thinking, what can I invent or what can I do to make a positive impact? And even if I do think I can make an impact, can I even invent the technology to go and do that, let alone ready a patent about it? And just hearing that you have this obviously phenomenal agency of superstars that have already thought of, these really obscure and weird problems to solve, such as water purification, growing food on austere places, and there might be open to you in coming and making it and productizing it and making a business out of it. I have to go check it out because it's super, super cool. But I have to ask, Shelli, along your career did you anticipate that you're going to become a space woman and such a strong advocate? You know, going to Capitol Hill and advocating for either its funding or support, is this a path that you imagined for yourself? I would never have imagined this for myself. You have to remember, when I started over 30 years ago, the space industry was very different than it is today. When I started, you work for the government and it was really a few, only a few countries even had space programs. And it was really about outer space. Low earth orbit with where the shuttle is, satellites, ground stations. Since the 80s, just to now you can see the commercialization. And it started with the right legislation that allowed commercialization of launch vehicles. But it also showed all this other technology. And so, we've gone from a few countries to over 80 countries are now part of the space economy and that's continuing to grow. And it went from where you work for the government or maybe a large company that works for the government to now you can be an entrepreneur and bring products to market yourself. So, we've seen this democratization, and the opportunity, again, for everyone to be part of this space economy. So, it's an exciting time for me. There's no way little ShelLi Brunswick could have imagined this, but I'm excited and I look forward to whatever the next thing is. When people say, "What do you think the next thing is?" It's like, who could ever thought GPS would be what it is today? And so, it's exciting. No, no, no. That's just phenomenal. So, Shelli, all of that sounds super exciting. And I never pictured, and when I think of all the different paths that my career could take me, I don't think that I even considered space as a viable option. I think that, growing up as a teen, a lot of the times when we talk about space, we immediately thought of the connotation of being an astronaut. And I remember that when I watched the movie Hidden Figures, which I'm sure that you're very familiar with, I think it really transformed my thinking about what different opportunities there are to be as a scientist and not necessarily as as the athlete scientist that is going up in the space shuttle. And now, I'm definitely reconsidering a lot of different paths that I could take. But Shelli, I'd love for you to tell me a little bit about where we're headed. What are the next steps in either space exploration discovery, scientifically speaking? And what can I get excited about for the next 10 years or so? Well, it's really exciting. What I do want to share is the space economy is currently 424 billion dollars. And that's projected to grow one to three trillion dollars by 2040. And Bank of America came out last month and said they're predicting the global space economy to be one point three trillion dollars by 2030. So, there's lots of opportunity. And that growth, again, is not just going to be in the launch vehicles and satellites. It's going to be here on Earth with data analytics and cyber and miniaturization of technology and advanced manufacturing and health care. So, you're going to see this awesome explosion, we'll use that term, of space technology being used in our daily life here on Earth. The Space Foundation has a program we call Space Technology Hall of Fame. And every year we recognize space technology that has been commercialized to help human beings on Earth. This year we recognize telehealth, telecommunications and teleconferencing. All technology that came from the space program that has made this year of covid even achievable. Because when you think about health care and communications, without those forms of space technology, this year of covid would have been very, very challenging, even more challenging than it is now. And it is extremely challenging for many folks. I couldn't even imagine what would happen if covid had broken out even in the early 2000s, or even 10 years ago. Right? I mean, a lot of our ability to adapt and to maintain to some degree, our daily routine work, work-life balance and family habits are due to these technologies. And so, it's very remarkable. Tell me a little bit about the Space Foundation and your work over there. Besides everything that we talked about, you're also a role model for so many women, whether it's through the awards you received or your mentorship in the different programs like Space4Women, I believe. Right? So, I would love to hear a little bit about your work as a mentor, but also as part of the Space Foundation. Well, wonderful. One of the activities I lead at the Space Foundation is our Center for Innovation and Education. And that is all about creative, inclusive, sustainable programs for workforce development and economic opportunity. So, all individuals can find their place in the space economy. And again, I shared with you that's the entire workforce pipeline. K through 12, teaching teachers, reskilling the workforce and then entrepreneurship. So, we're looking at the entire workforce pipeline because to grow that space economy one to three trillion dollars, we need everybody to look at space as a real opportunity. So, that's why I'm out here talking with you today and thank you for giving me this chance to get that awareness out there. That space is possible for everyone. We can help you find your way into the space economy. And then, we do have a workforce development roadmap. Awareness is number one, which we're doing today. Access, I just shared with you one access point. You know people who want to be entrepreneurs, but maybe are looking for that idea, go to that NASA Technology Transfer Office. The third one is, even if you have the desire to be in space, you do have to have the right training, whether that's a certificate in advanced manufacturing or cybersecurity or data analytics or a PhD, like you said, from Hidden Figures. And then, you want to connect. You want to connect with like minded individuals, join organizations like the ones you mentioned. WomenTech Network, that's the organization that I was honored to receive the Diversity and Inclusion Officer/ Role Model of the year from. They have a mentorship program. The UN Office of Outer Space Affairs, Space4Women, I'm one of 35 women around the globe that's part of that program. And again, it's about mentorship and connecting. There's other programs, Space Generation Advisory Council. So, look for organizations where you can connect. And then the last step is look for a mentor and be a mentor. Because no matter where you are in your career, you can mentor someone else and you can always look to be mentored and coached as well so that we can ultimately reach our true actualization of service before self and helping to contribute to the greater good. So, that tells you a little bit about the Space Foundation and our Center for Innovation Education, as well as a couple of those programs that I'm involved and that you mentioned. I think that's wonderful, Shelli. Thank you for sharing that. What is the one biggest challenge that you foresee us having with space? Whether it's in education, it's in the workforce, whether it's, you know, one of the things that I'm thinking about is a lot of people are talking that if a couple of hundred years, we might actually be living in a different planet. How is the world today going to impact as the government as we see it in the future? We see different countries looking at different interests. And I'm always curious about who's thinking about this stuff? You know, who's thinking about whether my great grandkids are going to be a part of government XY, or whether it will be an anarchy? Right? So, those are great questions. And the biggest challenge I see that's immediately impacting us as we look to grow in the space economy in the next 10 to 20 years is really that workforce. Do we have the right individuals. We have a skills deficit. We have that innovation gap. And we have a workforce shortage. So, as I shared with you, there are a lot of great opportunities in the space economy. We can't find enough workers. And so, what that means is some of the workers we have in the US, maybe they're in inner cities or rural communities or they've never thought about being part of the space economy. We need to inspire them to look for opportunities to join the space economy. During covid right now, individuals to get recertified, they could go through a certificate program and go into the manufacturing sector, data analytics, cyber. But right now we need that workforce. And then we have, like I said, the skills mismatch. We have individuals that are looking for jobs and we have jobs available in the space sector in all those different industries. But we have a mismatch of skills. So, we really need to look at it. And the Space Foundation is one organization that's out there talking about it, but we really have to work together to solve it. Government, public private partnerships, together we can work on solving these challenges. And then, of course, as I shared that innovation gap, we need entrepreneurs who want to take that risk and bring technology forward, not only to create a job for themselves, but to create jobs for others and benefit humanity. 100%. One of the things that I'm seeing a pattern here is this understanding we're educating the market in some sense, right? When you're starting a new company, when Airbnb started using space technology, of course, and they wanted people to rent their houses when they're not there, they were really educating the market with a new perception and new thinking process. Because previously it seems weird. What? I'm going to let somebody else live in my apartment while I'm away? Or, I'm going to sleep in somebody else's apartment. Here, it sounds like there's a similar challenge. Where we have, you know, a generation that needs, the space workforce needs them. But there is this misconception of are we able to actually be part of this workforce. And it sounds to me like, yes, we are. And now the question is, how do we educate the market? How do you think we should go? Is this already of the elementary middle school age? Is it more the college level? What's the sort of the thinking process of getting this education? Excellent. It's actually the entire workforce pipeline. So, you're right. We need to look at kids as young as possible. Especially girls and minorities who sometimes self eliminate in middle school from thinking about going into technology or space. They don't see that as a realistic career choice. So, it's about taking space inspired education and putting it in the classroom. And that's one of the things the Space Foundation does through our Center for Innovation Education is we create space inspired education. And we do a teacher training program so that teachers can help coach and mentor kids to stay on that track so that they can go into the space economy in a variety of different areas. And then we also, as I shared with you, it's reskilling and upskilling. So, we talk to various workforce centers around the country and talk about the importance of space and how they can look at training programs with community colleges, with universities to reskill the workforce as workers may be displaced by jobs that are being automated, as technology replaces workers. And how they can have a great job in the space economy. And on average, the jobs in the space economy pay 40% above the median income here in the US. And then, of course, it's about inspiring entrepreneurship. We have many entrepreneurs that are women or minorities, but many times they don't think about, "I could be a space entrepreneur". And so, again, it's about breaking down that perception that everyone can have an opportunity to be an entrepreneur in the space economy. Whether that's food service, fleet maintenance services provided through accounting, IT, all the way up to PhDs and mathematicians. There's an opportunity. And some of the programs we've done at the Space Foundation specifically do just that. We have a junior space entrepreneurship program to inspire middle school and high school kids to look at being entrepreneurs and taking space technology to market. We also have our Space Commerce Entrepreneurship Program, which is for adults, for entrepreneurs to look at, how do I find an idea? I can go to the NASA Technology Transfer Office. Or do I have a business but I want to create another line that I can sell to the aerospace and space industry. And so, we help them walk through what is it to create another line of business or to be start a new company. So again, it's that entire workforce. There's a place for everyone. And we have to be, as you said, breaking down those barriers that prevent individuals from thinking about joining us in the space industry. Shelli, it's inspiring and it makes so much sense. And I'm definitely have to do some rethinking on my own on how I can be a part of this space economy. Because it just sounds like, you know, first of all, I probably am a part of the space economy in one way or another, just by virtue of being in all those other industries that we mentioned in the beginning of this episode. But I'm excited to take a more active step and re-educate myself about what it means to be to potentially be a part of this workforce or be a space entrepreneur. Who knows. So thank you very much for this inspiration. It was phenomenal talking to you. I know how busy you are. So, thank you for being so generous with your time. And I have to ask you the most difficult question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. I think I said them a few times during the podcast. But obviously inspirational. We need to inspire other individuals to join us in the space economy. So, I would say I strive to be inspirational. Innovative. It's all about new technology benefiting life here on Earth. So, I believe innovation. And then obviously, agile. The first two are great being inspirational and innovative. But you got to be agile and you got to get out there and get it done. And if you're not successful the first time, get after it again. So, those would be the three ways I describe myself. And I would describe you as you are part of the space economy. And I'm grateful for the contributions you're making to make space a better place for everyone here on Earth. Thank you very much. I appreciate that very much. So, Shelly, thank you. Stay safe and stay healthy. And hopefully we'll see each other in space one day. I look forward to it. I'll meet you on Mars. Definitely. Thank you very, very much.
