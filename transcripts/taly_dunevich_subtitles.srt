1
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,040
Okay.

2
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,960
Taly Dunevich, thank you so much

3
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,960
for joining me in 20 Minute Leaders.

4
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,000
Thank you for having me.

5
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,120
So so fun to have you.

6
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,920
You know, just before we started the call,

7
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,840
I discovered that you were

8
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,120
a world champion and bronze medalist

9
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,840
in wind surfing.

10
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,520
That's true.

11
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,120
It was when I was very very young.

12
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:57,360
I'm not actually practicing

13
00:01:57,361 --> 00:01:59,520
that anymore, but yeah.

14
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:02,000
And you were the Israeli national champion

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,680
for quite some time as well.

16
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,760
Yes. Yes.

17
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,640
Unbelievable.

18
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,080
So, first of all, let's start with that.

19
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,400
Tell me, what is it like being

20
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:10,280
a national champion of a sport?

21
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,480
And actually Israel,

22
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,680
with the beach and the waves,

23
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,040
I mean, there's a lot of people surf.

24
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,040
So, it's not just like a random sport

25
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,120
that you picked up.

26
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,440
It's pretty popular.

27
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
And then what is it like going

28
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,440
to the world championship

29
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,120
and actually getting a medal?

30
00:02:23,121 --> 00:02:26,640
That's an amazing feeling to get a medal

31
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,360
and to compete against world champions.

32
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,480
It was a great experience

33
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,960
as I was a girl back then.

34
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,760
I was in high school and then the army.

35
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,400
This is the times

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,040
when I was actually doing that

37
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,400
and just being among the team

38
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,520
the Israeli team,

39
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,480
which was I was the only woman.

40
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,880
Still the only women in everything

41
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:48,480
I'm currently doing

42
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:50,200
in many areas in my life.

43
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,400
But back then I was the only woman

44
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,240
in the Israeli game.

45
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,000
And when we went to competitions

46
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:58,040
around the world,

47
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,520
I was kind of sleeping

48
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,160
with guys in the room.

49
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,040
They were taking showers.

50
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,280
They didn't even notice

51
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,240
I was actually a woman.

52
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:06,160
They kind of missed that.

53
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:08,040
So, I was really part of,

54
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,080
it was very unique time.

55
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:11,560
And I actually think

56
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
it really helps me today

57
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,000
because today I always find myself also

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,720
the only woman in the room

59
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:21,000
in most business environments,

60
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,320
I mean, IT kind of.

61
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,320
So, I feel very comfortable

62
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,360
because I grew up this way.

63
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,120
So, I'm already very very comfortable

64
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,760
being with a room or an ocean or a sea

65
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,439
or monitor improvements. So, it was fine.

66
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,040
Unbelievable. So, yeah.

67
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,240
So, you're not just an executive

68
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,080
in a tech company,

69
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,960
but you're actually an executive

70
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,720
in a deep technology tech company.

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,880
Ayehu Software and technologies.

72
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:45,400
I mean, it's leveraging

73
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,320
artificial intelligence

74
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,040
and machine learning to do some

75
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,080
really fantastic things.

76
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:50,520
And being an executive there

77
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,080
and vice president

78
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,800
of Strategic Partnerships and Alliances.

79
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,440
I mean, you're talking about

80
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,040
really understanding the technology,

81
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,040
but also understanding the other people

82
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,800
and the other in other companies.

83
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,360
And I guess in a similar industry,

84
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,520
which still today is still unfortunately

85
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,240
dominated by male counterparts, right?

86
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,400
Yeah.

87
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:10,120
And is that changing?

88
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,720
Or is that the norm?

89
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:14,080
What do you see

90
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,640
happening now in this domain?

91
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,000
I see a change. I see more women.

92
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,240
Not enough in leadership positions.

93
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,240
I see the more kind of coming of

94
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,760
as developers and program managers.

95
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,440
You see more and more of them.

96
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,680
Yeah.

97
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,440
And I'm inviting more women

98
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,360
and girls and join.

99
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:33,280
Of course.

100
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,520
By the way, Taly, I have to tell you

101
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,920
because I got so excited today.

102
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,440
This is not relevant to our conversation.

103
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,200
But I discovered

104
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,680
coconut water in the US today.

105
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,400
I never had it in my life in Israel.

106
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,000
And I'm obsessed with it.

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,960
So, these interviews,

108
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,080
I'm only drinking coconut water.

109
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,760
It's really really good coconut water.

110
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,320
It has actually a lot of electrolytes

111
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,120
and everything that you need

112
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,400
for your bodies, your workout

113
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:52,920
and everything.

114
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,200
It's really, really good.

115
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,240
When I went to Burning Man,

116
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,720
this is the one thing I really packed.

117
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,840
My entire RV was full with coconut water

118
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,040
because I was told that

119
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,640
this is a good thing to have in Burning Man

120
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,680
when you kind of you're not

121
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,240
really taking care of your nutrition.

122
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,760
Wonderful. Wonderful.

123
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,080
Okay. So, right before we started,

124
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,720
you're an expert on building

125
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,920
alliances and relationships.

126
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,840
And what I mentioned was that

127
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,920
I like talking about the things

128
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,280
that the guest or the leader

129
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,440
is passionate about.

130
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
And you immediately said,

131
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,880
I'm not passionate about alliances.

132
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,640
I'm passionate about people.

133
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,880
Tell me what that means to you.

134
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,400
So, alliance is just a piece of paper

135
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,200
where you write who is doing what, right?

136
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,080
So, I'm not passionate

137
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,080
about papers and words too much.

138
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,560
I'm more passionate about,

139
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,040
I'm very privileged to be doing

140
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,840
day in and day out what I love doing.

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,880
And I meet people.

142
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:38,920
And I meet people from different cultures

143
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,880
and different backgrounds.

144
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,680
I worked a lot with India, which is huge.

145
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,240
And I just love it.

146
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,360
And people in Europe and Nordics

147
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,040
and Israel and North America.

148
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,480
So, I work with all cultures.

149
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:55,760
I just love the platform,

150
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,280
or the agenda is a business agenda.

151
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,600
But just meeting people.

152
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,280
Meeting and understanding

153
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,120
where they come from.

154
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,120
What drives them.

155
00:06:06,121 --> 00:06:08,080
What beliefs they come from.

156
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:09,000
This is what I'm really,

157
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,160
I'm very very fascinated about

158
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:12,440
human beings in general.

159
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:16,080
So, my work allows me to explore more

160
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:18,240
my area of passion, which is people.

161
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,680
And through that,

162
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:20,960
when you're really interested,

163
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:22,880
when you're really curious in people

164
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,800
in where they're looking for

165
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,840
and what they wanna get.

166
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,200
I think it's a great way

167
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,800
to really accomplish

168
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,800
what you're also want to do for business.

169
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,680
Like to get the results,

170
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,520
to get the bottom line,

171
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,880
to get revenues,

172
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,960
because you can really build,

173
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:36,880
I really care.

174
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,960
I really, very fast, I built

175
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,320
relationship trust with people

176
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,280
because I really care and I really love,

177
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:44,480
I love them.

178
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:44,840
I don't know,

179
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:48,000
there is no other ways to say that.

180
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,840
It may sound corny,

181
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,200
but I really love people.

182
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,520
It's incredible and actually right.

183
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,880
As we're having this discussion,

184
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,720
we're talking about

185
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,600
an internship program for the fund

186
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,240
that we're both involved with, J-Ventures.

187
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,200
And going through the details

188
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,120
and seeing how passionate you are

189
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,360
in helping the future generation

190
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,880
and how they are going to be

191
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,680
integrated within

192
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,760
and learn from the fund

193
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,560
and the things that we're doing.

194
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,120
I think that speaks exactly

195
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,320
to what you're describing here.

196
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,720
And I wanna take you back a few years.

197
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,720
Talk to me a little bit about

198
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,640
how you form these relationships

199
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,080
in the business setting.

200
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,840
So, these are not just friends.

201
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,080
They're business friends that you're

202
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,800
forming alliances and relationships.

203
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,440
My imagination and tell me if I'm wrong,

204
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,960
is that, two years ago or three years ago,

205
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,080
you wanna form a business relationship.

206
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,560
You hop on a plane, you go over there,

207
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,520
you visit the offices,

208
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,600
you go out to dinner,

209
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,920
you go out to a Broadway show,

210
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:35,760
and you talk

211
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,080
and you slowly build that trust.

212
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,120
Is that fairly accurate?

213
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,880
I never took anyone to a Broadway show,

214
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,240
I have to say.

215
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,040
But that's the whole point.

216
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,000
That's why you do it.

217
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:48,080
No. You don't have,

218
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,960
I know that, it's difficult to say.

219
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,520
It tells people

220
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,280
you will dine and wine you

221
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,120
and all these stuff.

222
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,240
I do that to some extent, but not really.

223
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,280
It's really like, even through Zoom.

224
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,120
You don't need to take them

225
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,120
to fancy places or anything.

226
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,040
Just really speaking to people

227
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,280
and understanding where they come from.

228
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,360
Finding the common ground.

229
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,680
You always have something in common

230
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
with another person.

231
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:08,920
Right.

232
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,360
Really fast. If you're curious enough,

233
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,280
go find what it is

234
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,200
and you can build from there.

235
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,440
And then you have the initial connection.

236
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,720
And once you have that,

237
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,840
you'll learn more about each other.

238
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,080
And we're all just humans.

239
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,680
Even if we come

240
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,560
from different backgrounds.

241
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,880
There is so much in common.

242
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,520
There is more in common

243
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,560
than not in common.

244
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,880
And just you take down to barriers

245
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,360
and then you can, when you have trust

246
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:29,440
and you have connection,

247
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:31,160
you can build everything with it.

248
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,000
Anything with it.

249
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,560
So, just human connection.

250
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,400
I don't know.

251
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:35,720
No, no.

252
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,120
I mean, it sounds great.

253
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,320
But now, I wanna take us to 2020.

254
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,720
Yeah.

255
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,160
The great 2020,

256
00:08:42,161 --> 00:08:43,360
that everybody likes to say.

257
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,760
Yeah.

258
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,120
And we're in the middle of the year now.

259
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,640
We're a little bit more than the middle.

260
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,000
And how do you build relationships?

261
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,440
I joined a company,

262
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,880
a wonderful wonderful company,

263
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,040
Hippo Insurance.

264
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,880
I did my entire on-boarding remotely.

265
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,480
I didn't meet, I met one person

266
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,560
from my team in person.

267
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,680
The rest are only through video.

268
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,160
How can I, or how should I build

269
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,440
a meaningful relationship

270
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:13,120
with my colleagues over remote?

271
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,760
Is it different?

272
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,800
Is it easier or harder?

273
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,400
So, this is not the only

274
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:18,800
form of communication.

275
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,440
Yes. So, we use a lot of Zoom

276
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,160
and you go onto video calls.

277
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,520
I think it's a great medium

278
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,160
to connect deeply with people.

279
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,280
But we see it like we really look

280
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,800
at each other when the camera is on

281
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,840
and not off.

282
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,200
And people really look at each other

283
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,280
in the eyes.

284
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,520
I think it's very very close.

285
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,520
I don't see a lot of difference.

286
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,800
Sometimes it's even an advantage.

287
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,240
When in a room of people,

288
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,800
sometimes, some people

289
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,320
are not really related to the call

290
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,600
or to the meeting and,

291
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,440
I see disadvantage

292
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,320
and advantages to this medium.

293
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:55,160
I don't find it harder

294
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,560
to do business over Zoom

295
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,040
than I've done meeting face to face.

296
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,000
And is that also true

297
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,160
for meeting new people

298
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,040
or forming new relationships?

299
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,240
Yes.

300
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,680
Because I understand the transition from

301
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,840
existing relationships, continuing them.

302
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,240
But is that the same case also

303
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,840
for finding new partners

304
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:12,400
and getting to that same level

305
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,000
of intimacy?

306
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,680
Because you're missing

307
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,760
a lot of your senses, right?

308
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,280
You're missing smell, touch.

309
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,000
You're basically only going base to sound.

310
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:19,580
I think it's a good thing

311
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,320
to miss the smell part.

312
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,680
Well, I would assume that when you go

313
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,960
and build a business relationship,

314
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,880
then you make an effort to smell.

315
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,280
No. So, it's interesting

316
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
because this is really counter-intuitive

317
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,840
to everything that I thought of

318
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,200
what's happening today.

319
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,680
First of all,

320
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,560
I have a lot of new relationships

321
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,560
that I'm forming in the past four months

322
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,360
when I'm working from home now

323
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,680
and I'm not traveling anywhere.

324
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,400
So, I've been I've been forming.

325
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,480
And in the process

326
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,960
of forming new relationship

327
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,680
with new companies,

328
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,040
with new minute service providers,

329
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,400
its largest size.

330
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,000
And it's going really well.

331
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm actually more efficient

332
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,520
because I'm sitting here all day

333
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
meeting after meeting.

334
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,800
I can do more in the same amount of time.

335
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,840
I don't need to travel around anywhere.

336
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,320
And I can be very very focused

337
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,960
on what I'm doing.

338
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,920
And I have all my things here

339
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,760
and my notes.

340
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,200
Like I'm very very organized.

341
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,880
And I'm way more efficient.

342
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,800
So, I'm doing so much more activities

343
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,600
per day because I'm not traveling

344
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,440
and I don't have even

345
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:14,360
the office distractions.

346
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,520
And I don't need to be nice

347
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
to anyone around me

348
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:18,760
and have coffee with them during the day.

349
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,560
I can just really focus on work

350
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,400
which I love doing.

351
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,960
And I can do more.

352
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:24,760
And I can have one on ones.

353
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,120
And when I started relationship

354
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,680
with somebody,

355
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,860
I'm also connecting with them

356
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:29,000
via WhatsApp.

357
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,880
And starting other forms.

358
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,280
And then we're imagining the time,

359
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,720
the day that we will actually be able to,

360
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,240
or I'm going to have dinner

361
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,000
with them or something.

362
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,400
So, hopefully that will come soon.

363
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,800
I think it's fascinating how it impacts

364
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,960
so many different facets of our work.

365
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,120
And I definitely see the upside

366
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,880
and the downside of having this new norm.

367
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,240
Tell me a little bit about

368
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,840
what does it mean alliance building

369
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,200
in terms of corporate?

370
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,120
So, you're part of a big organization

371
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,880
that has IT services.

372
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,920
Why are alliances important

373
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,040
and what are alliance is actually

374
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,560
in the tech world?

375
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,800
So, it's really important.

376
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,600
Specifically in my company,

377
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,440
the alliance as far represent

378
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,200
over 60% of our revenues.

379
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,960
So, I'm responsible in my own company

380
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,000
for over 60%.

381
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,600
And this is why it's so important,

382
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,880
it really drives a lot of business

383
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,520
and it's way more efficient.

384
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,320
So, in our company,

385
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,480
we have direct team

386
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,480
that is selling directly to the enterprise

387
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,960
and we have the partners team,

388
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,880
which is my team,

389
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,640
and we're selling through partners.

390
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,720
So, and this part with less people,

391
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,440
we sell much more.

392
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,240
So, it's more efficient.

393
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,600
It's like opening the doors to

394
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,240
a more strategic long term relationship

395
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:50,120
versus just selling to one enterprise,

396
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,720
then to another enterprise.

397
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:53,160
When I form relationship

398
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:54,760
with our partners,

399
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,360
for example, the global GSIs of the world

400
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,160
like Accenture, Deloitte,

401
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:02,600
Cognizant, Capgemini,

402
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:04,920
just to name a few of the partners

403
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,120
that I'm working with.

404
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,720
So, when I formed this

405
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,360
trusted relationship

406
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,320
and we build the right

407
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,760
go to market plan together,

408
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:12,880
that opens the door

409
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,000
for my company to get to

410
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:17,440
40 of their accounts.

411
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,880
So, in forming one large alliances,

412
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:23,840
we can actually sell 40 licenses

413
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,320
versus one by one.

414
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,840
So, this is the opportunity.

415
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,200
And this is why it's very important.

416
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,360
And I really believe that today

417
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,880
in SAS companies, any company

418
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,320
that is selling software today,

419
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,120
partnership I think it's already

420
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,800
as it should be.

421
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,480
It will be a more integral

422
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,480
and big part of their business,

423
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,520
because today it's all about

424
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,160
the ecosystem.

425
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,800
The ecosystem you build around you.

426
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,400
It's like the ISPs, the GSIs,

427
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,080
all the different partners

428
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,880
that you're strategically engaging with.

429
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,680
And it's a win-win.

430
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,000
It helps them, helps us.

431
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,360
It's all about working together

432
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,920
and having synergetic type of results

433
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,520
out of that for both sides.

434
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,800
It has to work for everyone.

435
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,160
And that makes a lot of sense.

436
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,640
And then do the relationships

437
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,680
usually occur between key people

438
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,040
in both organizations?

439
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,000
Or is it organization to organization?

440
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:20,880
In other words,

441
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,240
you're building a relationship now

442
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:24,120
with another organization,

443
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,880
let's say Deloitte,

444
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,640
and then you're building it with

445
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,600
key people there

446
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,200
that are agreeing to this.

447
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,840
Let's say tomorrow they're advancing

448
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,040
to their next adventure,

449
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,960
how difficult is it to make

450
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,560
that transition of alliance

451
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:39,480
to another person?

452
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,720
Because you have to, all of a sudden

453
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:42,440
build trust and relationship

454
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,320
with another person who has to decide

455
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,920
whether to renew this relationship,

456
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,360
to renew this partnership, right?

457
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,360
So, when I'm building the relationship,

458
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,000
so first, yes, we're building it

459
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,600
with key people.

460
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,720
Key people and key people.

461
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,520
So, this is top down relationship.

462
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,360
But I'm also, even during the sale cycle,

463
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,280
I'm taking care of the bottom up as well.

464
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,120
So, making sure that their people

465
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,240
are getting certified and trained.

466
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,440
Right. Okay.

467
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,880
Making sure I create demands

468
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,880
on the different pockets

469
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,440
on the business level.

470
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,360
But kind of one layer,

471
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:20,120
two layers below that are actually

472
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,720
taking care of their account.

473
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,480
So, making sure they understand the value

474
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,320
and what it brings to their clients.

475
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,480
Making sure that they really are building

476
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,720
the incentives for them to work with us.

477
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,920
So, when you build it

478
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:33,680
with the top key people

479
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:35,360
and with the business level,

480
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,760
which is the medium unit director level,

481
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,400
that really manage accounts.

482
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,600
And you build it also

483
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,240
with the developers and operators,

484
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,480
and delivery people and service people.

485
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,920
On more the technical level

486
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,200
enablement type of thing.

487
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,120
So, you build anything,

488
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,040
all the levels in the right way

489
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,120
with a very defined

490
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,280
go to market plan and KPIs.

491
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,960
Everybody are aligned around KPI.

492
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,400
And you just manage this entire process.

493
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,760
Then it's really,

494
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,440
you're getting very very sticky.

495
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,480
It's really hard to leave you.

496
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,280
It's actually no reason to leave you.

497
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,880
You also have their personal relationship.

498
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,000
They will not just ditch you

499
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,440
for some reason.

500
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,320
You can identify if you have an issue

501
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,160
with anything.

502
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,520
And if there is any competition

503
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
that is threatening you

504
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,040
and addressed it before.

505
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,120
Of course. And when I want to,

506
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,200
when I have an ambition

507
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,640
to be a software engineer at a company,

508
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,280
I go and I study computer science.

509
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,240
I go online and I teach myself

510
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,560
how to code in Python or Java

511
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,320
or JavaScript.

512
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:37,880
When you want to be

513
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,080
in alliances and partnerships,

514
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,320
I don't believe there's a major for that.

515
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,040
I don't believe there is

516
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,000
an online text book.

517
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,440
Maybe there are some

518
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,880
self-help books on Amazon.

519
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,360
But it sounds like it's a lot of practice

520
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,320
on the job and on the field.

521
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,000
How do you prepare

522
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,920
for a position like that?

523
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,000
How do even set yourself up

524
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,160
to go and become a VP of that

525
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,360
at a company?

526
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,040
That's an awesome question.

527
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,360
I think the greatest university

528
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,750
for the work that I do called "life",

529
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,040
so,  if you're really,

530
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:11,750
and for me specifically,

531
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,030
this is really an area that I love.

532
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,640
I study like for my own fun

533
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:17,750
on the side.

534
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,480
I study brain science

535
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,720
and consciousness and spirituality.

536
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,160
And I have so much interest in human beings

537
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,400
and how we use this box here

538
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,560
in the top of our body called "brain".

539
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,200
And how we can really maximize it

540
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,510
and understand our beliefs

541
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,510
and how it drives us.

542
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,480
So, specifically for me,

543
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,790
I'm so interested in this area,

544
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,400
called "people",

545
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,320
and how everything works

546
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,960
in the universe altogether.

547
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,800
That, this is I think, for me

548
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,720
is  the best school.

549
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,440
Because everything,

550
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,920
all the books that I'm reading,

551
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:51,840
the podcast that I'm listening to,

552
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,880
or around those areas and I'm just,

553
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,320
Of course.

554
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,520
That really helps me in work,

555
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,310
I have to say.

556
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,360
But Taly, you're already a vice president

557
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,350
at a huge company.

558
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,160
How do you get to be a vice president

559
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,400
of partnerships and alliances

560
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,510
at a huge company?

561
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,680
Because you need that break

562
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,350
to be able to go and learn through life.

563
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,240
Is it easy to get this break?

564
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,760
Do you join, like where do you start

565
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,590
in order to get to that level?

566
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,840
It's the opposite of taking break of life

567
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,960
to learn something.

568
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,560
It's the opposite.

569
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,280
It's the more you're engaging in life

570
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,360
and the more you're busy.

571
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,200
So, I'm involve in many many things.

572
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,960
I'm involve in J-Ventures, right?

573
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,680
And now I'm helping putting together

574
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,000
the internship programs.

575
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,680
And through everything I do,

576
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,360
And I'm involved in high powered women.

577
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:35,960
And I'm involved in so many organizations.

578
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,520
The more I involve,

579
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:39,200
the more I have connections,

580
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,600
I have an amazing rolodex.

581
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,070
I know a lot of people.

582
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,310
I have a great network.

583
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
So, that's access

584
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,640
to just about everything.

585
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,840
So, anywhere I want to get to,

586
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,160
to get to know this person,

587
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,440
I can always get connected by somebody.

588
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,640
People will always help me.

589
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,440
My door is always open to helping others.

590
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,000
And I'm always,

591
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,560
my mission in life

592
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:01,200
is to really help others

593
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,270
grow in whatever they do.

594
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,520
So, I think the more you are,

595
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,480
you don't need to take a break

596
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,000
to learn that.

597
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,240
Actually the other way around.

598
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,550
Be engaged.

599
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,240
Stick with people, network.

600
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,590
Be fully in, in the game of life,

601
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,320
and that really helps

602
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,600
those type of positions

603
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,120
like business development and alliances.

604
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,760
And then, how knowledgeable

605
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,800
do you have to be on the tech side

606
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,270
of things to really understand?

607
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,680
Because at the end,

608
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,240
you're selling a product.

609
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,200
You're not actually selling.

610
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,160
You're finding ways to collaborate.

611
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,200
But at the end you have to understand,

612
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,830
That's okay. I'm selling.

613
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,550
I'm not hiding from it.

614
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,440
No, no. Do you consider it selling?

615
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,200
I am.

616
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,360
Because when I think of alliances

617
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,760
or partnerships, I think of

618
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,310
a win-win situation for both parties.

619
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,160
Well, it's true.

620
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:47,560
But I've been compensated for bottom lines

621
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,960
for revenues that I actually bring

622
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,920
to the companies.

623
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,000
So, it's very very measurable.

624
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,590
What I'm bringing  it's on my paycheck.

625
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:57,550
I can actually see how it's going.

626
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,750
I'm measured.

627
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,400
So, that's very much sells.

628
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,920
That's very much in line.

629
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:07,030
So, how do you have people get to that,

630
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:08,800
the tech side?

631
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
So, I'm not a techie.

632
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,960
I'm not an engineer.

633
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,280
I'm just learning everything I feel

634
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,120
when I have a gap

635
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,040
by just asking or learning

636
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
or going on YouTube

637
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,510
and reading and understanding.

638
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,400
And I always have like, not always,

639
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,800
but when at some point in the processes,

640
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,400
I am bringing more an engineer

641
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,680
to actually join me

642
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,070
through those calls and insert

643
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,280
a deep technical questions.

644
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,680
But on the high level,

645
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,440
I'm good enough to convey the benefits

646
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,160
the business outcomes.

647
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:45,360
And to even run through a demo

648
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,720
and be a bit technical to a degree,

649
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,720
not all the way.

650
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,680
So, it sounds like what you're saying

651
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,000
is that your strengths

652
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,720
or your're ability to really,

653
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,720
to look at others, understand their needs.

654
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,040
Understand both technology

655
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,320
but also business see, what does

656
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:04,000
Ayehu software technologies provide

657
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,800
and then finding that

658
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,200
sweet spot of collaboration

659
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,600
where you can you can provide

660
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,110
the services to them.

661
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,080
And then along the process later on,

662
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,590
you can provide that engineering input,

663
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,550
which can do a much deeper dive.

664
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,920
Which is not necessary

665
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,680
when you're at first in the high level

666
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,080
of what is this partnership

667
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,440
that we're gonna do.

668
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,960
Perfect. You answered it.

669
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,750
Okay. Wonderful.

670
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,760
Taly, what should I take away from this

671
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,720
as a young entrepreneur

672
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,830
as I go on my next venture,

673
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,320
what do I need to know in terms of

674
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,240
partnerships, alliances, maybe even

675
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,070
just selling products to others?

676
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,200
I was in general, I always like,

677
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,680
my first rule, even for myself,

678
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,000
is follow your heart.

679
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,070
So, follow your heart.

680
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,400
I'm trying to follow mine

681
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,790
and trying to understand what it tells me.

682
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,550
At times when it's not very clear,

683
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,520
this is the first life advice.

684
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,840
I think you'll be a great candidate

685
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,440
for any business development position

686
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,760
because you're such a people person.

687
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,160
Thank you.

688
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,110
Already.

689
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,760
And you have no problem

690
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,640
in just interacting with just about

691
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,960
anybody in any level at any.

692
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,590
So, you have everything you need.

693
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,590
You just need the content

694
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,120
to discuss about.

695
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,280
Which is like for me,

696
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,240
it's Ayehu today.

697
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,070
Tomorrow, I don't know.

698
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,200
Or yesterday it was something else.

699
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,590
But it's the same thing.

700
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,280
So, you already

701
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,240
have everything you need

702
00:22:26,241 --> 00:22:27,320
You're perfect.

703
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,720
If you're looking for something,

704
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,200
let me know.

705
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,830
Wonderful. Thank you.

706
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,070
Thank you very much, Taly.

707
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:33,840
Before we leave,

708
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,320
I have to ask you

709
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,640
the most important question.

710
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,790
My favorite question.

711
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,120
Three words that you would use

712
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,040
to describe yourself

713
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,720
or that any of your clients

714
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,960
would use to describe Taly.

715
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,560
So, I think the first thing

716
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,040
that comes to mind is what I said

717
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,880
throughout the session.

718
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,760
I'm a people person,

719
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,920
so, really loving people.

720
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,400
And just I'm really grateful

721
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,840
to be able to do that everyday,

722
00:22:57,841 --> 00:23:00,560
for many hours every day.

723
00:23:00,561 --> 00:23:03,110
A second thing.

724
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,110
What can it be?

725
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,070
Oh, so, I am a constant learner.

726
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,830
I always learn new things

727
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,070
and growth and learning.

728
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,960
I study quantum physics,

729
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,200
and consciousness and brain science.

730
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,440
And I just love learning new things

731
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:19,350
not even related to my work.

732
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,350
Everything becomes related at the end,

733
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,840
by the way.

734
00:23:21,841 --> 00:23:23,520
Everything is getting connected.

735
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,120
But you just, I always,

736
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,040
like I run every day.

737
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,560
I always listen to audiobooks

738
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,960
or podcast or something.

739
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:30,600
Even when I take a shower,

740
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,880
I'm just having something.

741
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,550
So, I always learn something.

742
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,520
What's your favorite audiobook

743
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,360
that you read recently?

744
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:39,760
Hit Refresh by Satya Nadella,

745
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,070
which is kind of a biography

746
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,800
which was really good.

747
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,110
And he was referencing to growth mindset,

748
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,110
by the way, speaking about growth.

749
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,680
He was referencing some Stanford

750
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:52,070
professor who wrote the book "Mindset".

751
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,560
And he really changed the entire culture

752
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:58,550
in Microsoft around this approach.

753
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,720
I don't know if you agree with that.

754
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,760
So, this were two great books

755
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,280
that I've read recently.

756
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,120
[--] power of now,

757
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,070
lead your life to spirituality.

758
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,790
Definitely.

759
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,480
And I need the third word.

760
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
So, I have people person.

761
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
I have constant learner.

762
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,160
Third, I would say I'm driven.

763
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,720
So, I'm involved in so many things.

764
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:17,760
I just drive things.

765
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,520
And my husband calls me "my engine".

766
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,880
I'm his engine.

767
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,070
I just let everything that I love,

768
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,760
if it's work,

769
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,880
driving business, driving sales,

770
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,640
helping Jay Ventures in the fund

771
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,790
or anything else I'm involve.

772
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,240
Just driving things forward.

773
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,200
I'm very task oriented to the degree

774
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,080
that I'm not trying to relax a little bit.

775
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:40,350
So, yeah.

776
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,000
So, I would say

777
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,440
those are the main three things.

778
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:43,240
Tally, toda raba.

779
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:44,480

780
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,000

Thank you. Bye bye.
