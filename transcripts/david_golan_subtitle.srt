1
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,200
David Golan, thank you so much

2
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,080
for joining me on 20 Minute leaders.

3
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,920
Thanks for having me.

4
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,400
Well, artificial intelligence,

5
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,040
health care, helping save lives,

6
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,760
postdoc at Stanford,

7
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,200
this is a complete honor of mine.

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,680
So, I'm very very glad to have you.

9
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,760
David, you're the CTO of Viz.ai.

10
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,960
I can't believe you just tell

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,560
you're over a hundred people

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,200
across the US and Israel?

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,920
That's just insane.

14
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,480
David, right before we go back

15
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,680
to your personal journey,

16
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,600
give me a little bit of context

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,160
what is Viz.ai and how do you integrate

18
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,000
artificial intelligence with health care?

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,080
So, our mission at Viz.ai

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,840
is to facilitate better care for patients

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,600
by applying artificial intelligence,

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,800
detecting for example, stroke

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,880
or other pathologies that require

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,320
immediate attention and alerting

25
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,200
the right physician immediately

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,080
using our AI and using our own

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,640
mobile platform so they can treat

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,760
the patient much faster.

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,640
So, just for context about the problem,

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,800
you're saying this idea

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,840
of detecting a stroke.

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,440
When I think of somebody having a stroke,

33
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,400
I think about the movies;

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,360
I'm thinking about somebody who is

35
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,040
stopping in the middle of the street;

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,120
they're starting to realize

37
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,240
that something is weird;

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
they made me fall down

39
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,960
and then eventually,

40
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,800
somebody will call 911.

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,960
I'm guessing that the problem

42
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,720
is that oftentimes it's too late, right?

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,560
I mean, that every second there counts.

44
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,040
Yeah. So, stroke is

45
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,320
the single most time critical condition

46
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,000
in all of medicine, with the exception

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,040
of a kid choking on a grape.

48
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,760
Every minute that goes by,

49
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,120
the patient loses two million neurons

50
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,240
that translate to over four days

51
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,760
of disability free life.

52
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,120
So, it's really a race against time.

53
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,080
And we all have these images from media

54
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,240
of someone who is having a stroke

55
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,000
and being rushed to the hospital.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,880
The sad fact is that the delays

57
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,760
typically happen

58
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,640
within the hospital system.

59
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,920
So, the largest delays are

60
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,640
after the patient is admitted,

61
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,240
actually, more often than not

62
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,120
even after the patient is imaged,

63
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,040
so the patient was in a city scanner

64
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,760
somewhere in a file system,

65
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,040
there's a sequence of bits and bytes

66
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,960
that tells this patient

67
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,160
is having a stroke,

68
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,080
but just the system it's human based,

69
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,480
very sequential linear system

70
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,560
is not efficient

71
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,320
at triaging those patients

72
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,080
identifying who needs

73
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,920
emergent care and who doesn't.

74
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,560
And sort of skipping the queue

75
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,760
and making sure the right patient

76
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,560
gets the right treatment.

77
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,760
And this is basically what we do.

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,120
Right. So, it's not a problem

79
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,160
of proficiency, of taking care of it,

80
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,920
but it's a problem of diagnosing

81
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,880
the urgency of the situation, right?

82
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,480
Exactly.

83
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,040
Exactly.

84
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,000
So, it's really not about,

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,120
in the context of AI and radiology

86
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,640
and interpreting scans,

87
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,920
people will sort of saying:

88
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,520
AI will replace the radiologist,

89
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,960
that will not replace the radiologist,

90
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,720
who's better.

91
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,680
It's really not about being better.

92
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,720
It's about being everywhere, 24/7,

93
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,080
being diligent, never taking a break,

94
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,800
which computers can do and humans can't.

95
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,680
Not to mention the cost.

96
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,520
So, the AI is always there in the cloud.

97
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,360
Every single scan goes to the cloud.

98
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,400
We're at about, I think,

99
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,760
45,000 scans a month now.

100
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,960
Going to the cloud, being interpreted,

101
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,360
about one out of ten is a stroke.

102
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,040
The AI identifies the stroke,

103
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,120
sends an alert,

104
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,080
the physician gets alert.

105
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,000
The physician, by the way,

106
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,600
is more often than not

107
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,880
in a different hospital

108
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,600
or at home or driving or whatnot,

109
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,840
they get the alert,

110
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,080
they have a mobile platform,

111
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,240
they can do the scans,

112
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,880
they can communicate with the team.

113
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,320
And this really changes

114
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,720
the flow of health care

115
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,960
from this sequential

116
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,040
one step after the other

117
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,160
very slow process.

118
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,160
Something, everybody gets the alert.

119
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,280
Everybody sinks in on the mobile platform,

120
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,640
makes a decision, go go go,

121
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,960
and treat the patient much much faster.

122
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,560
So, just to paint me the picture again.

123
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,800
Where is the scan taking place?

124
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,640
So let's say I'm the one

125
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,120
who is experiencing the health condition,

126
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,600
where am I physically located

127
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,840
while the scan is taking place?

128
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,680
And why am I so disconnected

129
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,880
from the whole health care system

130
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,080
that you're talking about?

131
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,560
Yeah. So, if you're unfortunate enough

132
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,040
to have a stroke

133
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,480
or to be suspected of a stroke,

134
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,440
you will be taken to hospital, to an ER,

135
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,760
and you will be scanned.

136
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,000
Now, during 60 and 70% of the time,

137
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,600
the facility that you're being scanned at

138
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,520
does not have the full capability

139
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,440
to treat you as a stroke patient.

140
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,200
You will need to be triaged

141
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,640
and transferred to another facility.

142
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,720
It's called the Comprehensive Strokes Center.

143
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,040
And I mean, immediately,

144
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,200
if you've been in the hospital once,

145
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,160
you know how inefficient this can be.

146
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,040
Immediately you see there's chain

147
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,720
of hand off that needs to happen.

148
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,880
And remember, also,

149
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,480
even in the smaller hospital,

150
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,800
it's less experienced,

151
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,160
they don't see as many strokes

152
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,440
or they're not as practiced with it.

153
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,000
And this is all due to human error,

154
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,240
due to overload, due to a tired physician

155
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,480
or just due to random stuff

156
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,240
like someone calling someone else

157
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,040
while they're already on the phone

158
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,800
with a third party.

159
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,120
Those delays introduced

160
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,880
and those drops in this process.

161
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,880
So, we completely eliminate this.

162
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,840
And actually, if you're okay with this,

163
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,560
I just want to share something

164
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,940
from literally from earlier today.

165
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,160
Yeah. Of course.

166
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,360
I can send this afterwards.

167
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,720
There's the post in LinkedIn

168
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,040
from Piedmont.

169
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,080
We just went live at Piedmont.

170
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,880
It was exciting day for us at Piedmont.

171
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,800
We have officially launched

172
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,080
with Viz.ai cross our health system.

173
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,400
Our first case came through

174
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,320
and LVO, LVO is the type of stroke,

175
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,040
was received even before the images

176
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,520
made it to the system.

177
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,200
Physician notes that Viz.ai saves

178
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,240
at least 15 minutes on this case.

179
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,160
15 minutes?

180
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,240
15 minutes is 60 days

181
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,920
of disability free life

182
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,040
and saves 150 days of potential

183
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,840
loss of functional independence.

184
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,760
This is from today.

185
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,440
This is like I shed a tear

186
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,000
when I read that.

187
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,240
David, I'm getting emotional here

188
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,740
listening to you say that.

189
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,080
So, you're reading this post,

190
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,560
and I'm literally tearing up

191
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,720
as I'm hearing this,

192
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,360
because this is probably something

193
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,480
that I'm the most passionate about,

194
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,840
using technology to literally save lives.

195
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,060
A lot of entrepreneurs go

196
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,720
and build products that are trying

197
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,840
to make the world a better place

198
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,880
or have a positive impact.

199
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,320
You're literally saving people's lives.

200
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,840
And you're not just saving them

201
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,440
from life and death,

202
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,320
you're also saving their well-being.

203
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,160
It's not just about whether they survive,

204
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,760
but it's about their quality of life

205
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,480
moving forward,

206
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,840
which I think is completely inspiring.

207
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,600
Talk to me a little bit

208
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,560
about your personal journey

209
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,400
going into this.

210
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,280
So, you're teaching assistant

211
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,400
at Tel Aviv University,

212
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,000
you work on algorithms at VMware,

213
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,160
you're a postdoc at Stanford.

214
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,840
How do you go into this realm

215
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,960
of artificial intelligence

216
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,840
and transition into co-founding

217
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,400
this amazing company?

218
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,320
Yeah. So, it's a good question.

219
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,080
And my background

220
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,880
has been a bit random.

221
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,040
Throughout my adult life,

222
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,760
have been gravitating towards

223
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,640
what's interesting and fun

224
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,080
and challenging.

225
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,040
And as you mentioned,

226
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,120
I worked and I developed algorithms.

227
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,440
In the tech industry,

228
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,360
I did some cool stuff in my undergrad,

229
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,040
masters and PhD.

230
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,680
And I came to Stanford for a postdoc

231
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,840
to focus on statistical learning

232
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,040
and genetics and genomics

233
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,760
and solve the world's problems.

234
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,440
And I guess, two main things happened:

235
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,080
one of them is, I guess,

236
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
everything depends on luck.

237
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,480
But I came to Stanford exactly when

238
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,400
for the first time

239
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,840
Convolutional Neural Networks class

240
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,240
was taught at Stanford.

241
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,520
And I was like completely randomly,

242
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,240
I stumbled upon it and I said,

243
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,840
"Well, let's go and listen

244
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,480
what is this stuff

245
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,000
that keeps coming up recently."

246
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,440
"Everybody saying this is a big deal."

247
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,800
And I go there, one or two lectures.

248
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
And it's obvious that

249
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,840
this is a game changer.

250
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,360
It's obvious that

251
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,600
something really really big

252
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,640
is happening here.

253
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,000
It's not another method,

254
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,960
another algorithm.

255
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,720
It's really about something

256
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,760
that's going to change a lot of things.

257
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
Do you remember who was

258
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,000
teaching the class back then?

259
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah. It was Andrej Karpathy,

260
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,280
famous CS231n

261
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,480
to like everybody whose done it.

262
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,400
CS231n, it's the notorious class

263
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,080
of Convolutional Neural Networks.

264
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,200
Yes. So, I mean, that was the first time

265
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,600
it was done at Stanford

266
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,600
and it was absolutely mind blowing.

267
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,640
Wow.

268
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,200
I mean, immediately I said,

269
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,760
"Okay. Let's see how we can apply that

270
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,520
in research, in genetics and genomics."

271
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,880
And start dabbling with medical imaging,

272
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,640
started playing with all sorts of stuff.

273
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,720
Completely unrelated to that,

274
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,800
I actually, the story I told you about

275
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,040
the patient being scanned and so on,

276
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,560
I actually experienced it.

277
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,360
I was admitted about five years ago

278
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,280
to Stanford Hospital

279
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,400
with a suspected stroke.

280
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,920
Really.

281
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
Yeah. So, actually,

282
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,880
it ended up not being a stroke.

283
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,560
And that's a different

284
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,520
neurological thing

285
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,680
that's completely reversible.

286
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,440
And I'm fine and healthy.

287
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,560
So, don't worry,

288
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,480
but like everything I tell you

289
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,960
about the delays, about the disconnect,

290
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,600
I literally experience those

291
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,040
being like unable to speak;

292
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,600
paralyzed in half of my body;

293
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,960
on a bed at Stanford

294
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,640
looking out and saying,

295
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,560
"What the hell is going on?"

296
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,400
"Why are things taking so long?"

297
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,600
And it is one of the best hospitals

298
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,240
in the world.

299
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,320
Exactly. it was like Monday morning,

300
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,000
you wouldn't feel like

301
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,280
Christmas Eve or something.

302
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,120
It was absolutely,

303
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,840
absolutely mind blowing.

304
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,280
So, half of the brain

305
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,680
is super freaked out that I'm going to be

306
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,760
disabled to rest of my life.

307
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,960
And half of the brain is like,

308
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,280
"What the fuck is going on?"

309
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,920
I'm sorry.

310
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't know how to say that.

311
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,640
You can delete it.

312
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,560
No no no. This is 100% okay.

313
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,440
And I was fortunate

314
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,520
to meet my co-founder, Chris Mansi.

315
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
I was introduced actually

316
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,040
following this incident

317
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,920
by a mutual friend.

318
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,400
Chris is a neurosurgeon by training.

319
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,320
And he was at the business school

320
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,680
at Stanford and we actually met

321
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,680
at a friend's, sitting in his backyard

322
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,760
on the bonfire and I told him my story.

323
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,320
And he says to me,

324
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,880
"Dude, you're lucky you're alive."

325
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,080
"Everything is fine."

326
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,400
"I lost dozens of patients

327
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,000
on my operating table

328
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
over stupid stuff like someone

329
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,080
not picking up the phone

330
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,640
at the right time."

331
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,480
"And I actually came to Stanford

332
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,000
to fix this."

333
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,840
And like, we started talking,

334
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,400
"How would you fix this?"

335
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,560
If everything was automatic,

336
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,320
if computers were there instead of humans,

337
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,880
things would have been much better.

338
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,600
And I remember,

339
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,280
we actually Googled on his phone

340
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,000
some images and I look and said,

341
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,480
"I think with deep learning

342
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,360
we can probably automate this."

343
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,400
Unbelievable.

344
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,080
When was this? How long ago was this?

345
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,200
This was beginning of 2016.

346
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,520
Wow. So, we're talking about

347
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,760
four years ago.

348
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,880
And fast forward, and you're running

349
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,640
over a hundred person company

350
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,920
and you're saving lives.

351
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,840
So, talk to me a little bit

352
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,480
about what's happening today.

353
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,640
So, you're saying

354
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,040
you have 45,000 scans a month.

355
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,280
10% of those are our stroke cases.

356
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,320
Which means that in the current state,

357
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,280
you're literally helping save the lives

358
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,640
of 4,500 people,

359
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,200
either saving them from life and death

360
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,360
or saving their well-being

361
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,640
for hundreds of days, right?

362
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,520
Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, now we've seen

363
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,720
very rapid adaption in the US.

364
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,560
We're live in over 500 hospital,

365
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,240
seeing a lot of patients.

366
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,640
Accumulating evidence

367
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,240
that implementation of this software

368
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,280
reduces the time,

369
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,720
improves patient outcomes,

370
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,960
reduces length of stay in the hospital

371
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,280
and all that coming from

372
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,640
different hospital systems across the US.

373
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,240
So, it's fairly robust.

374
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,760
Yeah, it's really exciting.

375
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,000
We're launching new products.

376
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,880
We're expanding beyond stroke.

377
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,800
We have a brain bleed product.

378
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,280
We have a few others that are

379
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,120
coming down the pipeline.

380
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,240
Yeah. It's actually been a lot of fun.

381
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,680
So, David, I have to ask company culture.

382
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,320
Because it's something

383
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,480
that's fascinating for me

384
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,040
as a young entrepreneur myself

385
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,160
and thinking about leadership

386
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,040
and what it means

387
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
to really motivate people,

388
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,080
and I'm seeing my class at Stanford

389
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,640
and my friends from 8200,

390
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,680
it's all about mission driven companies.

391
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,880
We want to join companies

392
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,720
that are mission driven,

393
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,040
that have a purpose that we feel

394
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,160
a part of a community.

395
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,520
I'm assuming this,

396
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,000
but if you're looking

397
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,040
at the hundred plus people

398
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,560
that are working at Viz.ai,

399
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,440
is there a shared goal here?

400
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,480
Do people understand the magnitude

401
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,160
of what you're achieving here?

402
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,280
Well, I think the answer is yes.

403
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,040
We put a lot of effort into it

404
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,960
and it's super important.

405
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,840
Furthermore, we have a core values

406
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,000
and the number one value

407
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,440
and by far the most important

408
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,760
is patient first.

409
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,320
And it's really about the patients.

410
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,460
Even recognizing that

411
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,320
it's about the patients,

412
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,160
not even about the users

413
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,160
or what is paying for the product.

414
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,640
We have different backgrounds

415
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,280
in the company.

416
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,240
People coming from health care,

417
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,160
which is a lot of the

418
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,360
commercial/ customer phasing,

419
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,400
they get it immediately.

420
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,880
We have a customer success team,

421
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,320
many of them are stroke nurses

422
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,720
and stroke coordinators jumped ship

423
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,800
because they understand that

424
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
this is the way to really transform.

425
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,640
In Israel, we have an engineering team

426
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,920
and we're slightly removed

427
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,480
from what's going on.

428
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,000
So, we do a lot.

429
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,200
We have all hands,

430
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,840
we have what we call

431
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,560
the magic moment section

432
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,800
where we share one or two stories

433
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,520
like the one I shared with you earlier.

434
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,240
We have our brain time fashion,

435
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,880
we call it, it's a 30 minute every week

436
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,960
where we just review interesting cases,

437
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,680
what happened;

438
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,560
did they use the app;

439
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,120
did they use it properly;

440
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,960
did something strange happened.

441
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,640
So, yes, we really try to connect

442
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,720
even every single person in the company

443
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,840
to the fact, I mean,

444
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,600
this is what differentiates from others

445
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,600
this Viz as place of work.

446
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,720
You can go work in other places,

447
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,360
some may even pay you more money,

448
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,440
but I strongly believe

449
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,480
it's one of those places where you can see

450
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,080
a very direct line from your work

451
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,960
to numbers of lives saved.

452
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,280
Unbelievable.

453
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,240
So, talk to me a little bit

454
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,160
about this intersection

455
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,920
of artificial intelligence

456
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,520
and health care and medicine in general.

457
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,280
Where is this headed?

458
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,440
Because this is something that

459
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,320
I guess, 10, 15 years ago,

460
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,360
there wasn't too much innovation

461
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,080
going on with, especially using

462
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
these technologies

463
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,920
and completely transforming the way

464
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
that health care is processed.

465
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,960
And just like

466
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,040
the amazing things that you're doing,

467
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,160
there's other companies

468
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,320
like Zebra Medical Vision

469
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,720
that are doing phenomenal things

470
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,400
and other companies around the world.

471
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,360
What is the trend?

472
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,000
And how can people that are perhaps,

473
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
pursuing a PhD in artificial intelligence

474
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,440
or that are mathematicians,

475
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,600
how can they find this smooth integration

476
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,240
in implementing these algorithms

477
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,960
into actual sustainable products

478
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,000
that can actually improve people's lives?

479
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,200
I guess that's a million dollar question.

480
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,880
And I think there's few ways to attack.

481
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,640
First of all, in terms of the trends,

482
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,800
yes, for a very long time,

483
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,400
not a lot has happened.

484
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,440
And I think most of the reason is that

485
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,640
people focused on trying to beat humans

486
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,840
at their own game by creating better.

487
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,200
There was a lot of focusing on ecology,

488
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,240
for example, in breast mammography,

489
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,960
trying to be better than a human

490
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,760
in a very hard task.

491
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,000
What we did at Viz, which was the first

492
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,660
and it was a new regulation

493
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,440
created by the FDA for us,

494
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,040
was not to compete with humans

495
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,120
in their own game, but say,

496
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,320
where does the computer

497
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,560
have an advantage

498
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,040
where time is of the essence.

499
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,600
All right.

500
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,320
So actually, algorithms

501
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,400
are not more accurate than humans.

502
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,160
Humans like the expert reading

503
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,160
this head scan, they don't miss a stroke.

504
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,920
It's not about accuracy.

505
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,440
It's about getting them in front

506
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,240
of the right patient at the right time.

507
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,320
And there you can show

508
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,440
very very substantial clinical benefit.

509
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,400
We convinced the FDA

510
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,120
they created a new regulation

511
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,560
called Computer Aided Triage for this.

512
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,240
And now, I just actually,

513
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,360
recently we did a survey about 30 devices

514
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,000
in this category using us as a predicate,

515
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,640
and this has become the number one way

516
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,920
for AI companies to have

517
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,320
a foot in the door

518
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,680
in the health care system.

519
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,200
So, what is the lesson?

520
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,080
I don't think the lesson is

521
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,400
you should go do triage.

522
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,120
I think the main thing is that

523
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,800
you have to sort of forget about AI,

524
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,920
and we have AI know a name here,

525
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,280
but let's forget about the AI for a second

526
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,960
and you have to really find a problem

527
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,840
that needs fixing.

528
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,800
A pain point

529
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,920
that's so painful to patients,

530
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,120
to physicians, and also

531
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,680
to the financial people of the hospital,

532
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,960
because stroke is financially

533
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,680
a very big deal.

534
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,600
It's actually the number one

535
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,280
health care expense in the US.

536
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Wow.

537
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,440
And then you say,

538
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,520
"What do I need to fix it?"

539
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,880
And AI may be part of the solution.

540
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,240
And by the way, when I think of Viz,

541
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,120
when we ask our customers,

542
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,880
"What is the biggest feature of Viz

543
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,440
that you like the most?"

544
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,040
AI doesn't always come up first.

545
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,080
It's part of the whole solution.

546
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,080
The solution is a technology,

547
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,160
a mobile viewer,

548
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,960
skill chat they can use, it's AI.

549
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,120
It's also a customer success representative

550
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,920
that really understands stroke

551
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,040
and works with them

552
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,840
to improve their stroke workflow

553
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,560
and how they leverage

554
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,000
what Viz has to offer to improve

555
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,320
their own workloads on.

556
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,400
So, it's really holistic.

557
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,600
So, what I'm trying to say is

558
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,840
if you're an AI practitioner

559
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,560
and you have a hammer

560
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,480
and you're now looking for a nail,

561
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,880
everything looks like a nail.

562
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,560
Don't do that.

563
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,600
First, find the problem.

564
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,560
Convince yourself

565
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,920
that there's a clinical case,

566
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,480
a business case,

567
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,200
and then if AI can help you, wonderful.

568
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,920
100%. And it's inspiring

569
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,160
because what I'm gathering from this,

570
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,440
and you're saying it's not the AI

571
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,680
that is Viz.

572
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,920
It's Viz and AI is a component.

573
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,720
It's a tail of Viz.

574
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,440
And you're providing

575
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,680
this holistic experience

576
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,080
that is trying to capture

577
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,600
a lot of the misalignment

578
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,680
within the industry

579
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,560
or within the process

580
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,600
of a potential stroke patient.

581
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,760
The AI is sort of the helper tool

582
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,640
to allow that to happen.

583
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,200
But it's all these other resources,

584
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,960
whether it's the customer success person

585
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,160
or the secure chat,

586
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,040
or understanding the problems

587
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,760
of that specific organization.

588
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,600
And I think that's a really big lesson

589
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,520
that I'm taking from this.

590
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,680
Because as a technology enthusiast myself,

591
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,560
I'm constantly reminding myself

592
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,280
that it's not just about the algorithm,

593
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,160
it's not just about the code.

594
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,400
It's about how do you actually

595
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,160
bring this to market

596
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,520
and make it something that's useful.

597
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,600
David, this was inspiring and insightful.

598
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,200
Thank you for taking the time to do this.

599
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,280
And I'm sure that it's

600
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,880
running over one hundred person company

601
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,360
and doing the things that you're doing,

602
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,280
I'm definitely very very honored

603
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,120
that you're willing to do this.

604
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,840
But before we leave,

605
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,000
I have to ask for three words

606
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,120
that you would use to describe yourself.

607
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,160
Okay. So, the first one,

608
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,080
I think it's two words,

609
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,200
but it's [--]

610
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,000
I would say, naive/ optimistic.

611
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,280
Like people make fun of me all the time.

612
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,120
I always think some things are like

613
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,920
would be really easy to do,

614
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,200
and they always turn out to be harder.

615
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,440
But you have to believe

616
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,360
that you can do it

617
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,000
and that it's possible,

618
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,080
so take the first step.

619
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,760
And I think the second one would be

620
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,240
something big for me right now,

621
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,960
it's being a father.

622
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm a father of three.

623
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,440
And we have a six month baby

624
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,000
that was born just before

625
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
the lockdown here.

626
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,160
Wow.

627
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,800
So, kids are probably a big thing,

628
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,040
but recently, even more than that.

629
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,800
And the third thing I would say,

630
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,920
I thought about

631
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,520
going with geek, nerd thing,

632
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,960
but I actually went with a statistician.

633
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,200
I'm a Holocaust statistician by training.

634
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,800
I do machine learning and stuff,

635
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,520
but my training is statistics.

636
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,360
And I consider myself a statistician

637
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,680
who apply statistics

638
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,280
to how he thinks about the world.

639
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,760
And that actually has been

640
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,280
extremely useful at the Viz journey

641
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,040
and in life in general.

642
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,760
So, yeah, I guess we'll go to those three.

643
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,840
David, thank you very much. Toda raba.

644
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,040
Keep helping save people's lives.

645
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,600
And I'll keep following the journey.

646
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,680
Thank you very much.

647
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,120
Thank you.
