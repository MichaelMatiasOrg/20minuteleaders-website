1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,560
You have to really try and see where

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,879
you can identify need.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,479
This is marketing was all about.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,399
It's about identifying the needs

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,320
and finding the right product

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,500
to match those needs.

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,639
Shirley Segal,

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,959
thank you so much for joining me

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,919
on 20 Minute Leaders.

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,440
Good morning.

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,159
Thank you.

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,759
Good morning.

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,159
And thank you for having me.

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,959
It's a pleasure to have you.

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,159
We're calling from a sunny morning

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,919
here in Tel Aviv, but actually,

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,639
it's not your preferred weather.

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,400
You mentioned to me

19
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,591
that your preferred weather

20
00:01:09,592 --> 00:01:10,939
for some really weird reason

21
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,320
is foggy rain?

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:14,919
I don't know.

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,759
I'm a broken Israeli I think.

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,159
Probably my soul was born somewhere

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,439
in the prairies of Poland.

26
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,919
I like the drizzling.

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,399
I like it where it's nice and gloomy.

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,199
That's where I'm happiest.

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,399
But I'm born here.

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,639
So, I go along with the flow.

31
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,479
What can I do.

32
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,119
So, you're going to have to go along

33
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,999
with the beautiful weather

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,999
and the beautiful sun

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,159
that goes on the beach.

36
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,959
But it's okay.

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,839
Because today,

38
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,159
we're talking about your journey.

39
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,650
We're talking about

40
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:46,319
being a marketing director

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,599
at various companies.

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,439
Very, very well known in Israel.

43
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,799
All the way from Bezeq

44
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,314
to Cellcom to Zap,

45
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:54,839
companies that really marketing

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,839
is part of their core,

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,239
ideation and innovation.

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,313
We know how difficult

49
00:02:01,314 --> 00:02:02,079
the market is in Israel,

50
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,879
so, I'm excited

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,839
to talk about that.

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,159
But I'm also excited to talk about

53
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,822
your experience with the 8200

54
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:08,599
International Alumni Community

55
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,319
and how that relates back

56
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,199
to serving in the 8200 units.

57
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,039
So, Shirley, take me back.

58
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,639
How do you start your journey

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,679
out of 8200?

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,479
What is sort of like

61
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,800
your thinking process as you go along?

62
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,479
Oh, I was

63
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,359
in a very traditional thinking process.

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,759
Okay, I need to go to the university,

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,119
Tel Aviv University, the best university,

66
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,252
the best place, because I'm  8200

67
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:37,719
and that's where we went.

68
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,479
And I think the click happened

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,479
during Marketing 101.

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,719
And the MBA

71
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,319
of business administration

72
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,519
in the Tel Aviv University,

73
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,559
it was like falling in love.

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,879
Suddenly the way

75
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,719
I understood about how to influence,

76
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,839
how to understand

77
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,159
and influence people's behavior,

78
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,959
that was where I found myself

79
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,999
in my natural element.

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,987
I remember distinctly I said,

81
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:12,079
"Oh, this is what I want to do."

82
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,399
And from that point on,

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,119
my aim was to go

84
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,439
to the best places in Israel

85
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,639
and later on international.

86
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,569
To the best places

87
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,479
where the marketing challenges,

88
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,119
the one that will actually blow my mind.

89
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,079
So, started up

90
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,839
for one of the Bezeq companies.

91
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,239
But actually Cellcom,

92
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,519
I think was probably the one

93
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,079
that really formed

94
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,999
my marketing personality.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,719
Because Cellcom, at the time

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,279
was a company for the big numbers.

97
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,839
And this is marketing for me.

98
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,279
This is the real challenge in marketing.

99
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:03,559
It's taking a whole world of numbers

100
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,930
and trying to find  the story behind them.

101
00:04:06,931 --> 00:04:09,159
And not only try and find

102
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,239
the story behind them,

103
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,999
make your story so that it works.

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,439
So, this is like sound like Lit 101.

105
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,480
No, but it's marketing 101.

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,439
So, whether it starts

107
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,560
with huge excels files,

108
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,920
Arpo and Age,

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,800
you have to really try and see where,

110
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,879
where you can identify needs.

111
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,759
This is marketing was all about.

112
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,639
It's about identifying the needs

113
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,120
and finding the right product

114
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,079
to match those needs.

115
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,799
And funnily enough, those needs

116
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,879
will appear on Excel sheets.

117
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,120
They will also appear on focus groups.

118
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,999
And something that little people know

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,159
but it will also appear

120
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,959
when you talk to colleagues.

121
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,879
And we had some

122
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,679
of the greatest success stories,

123
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,879
coming out not from focus groups

124
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,399
and not from talking to customers,

125
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,199
and that's from looking

126
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,519
at the Excel sheet.

127
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,119
But it was this, how about if

128
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,759
we did this first plan

129
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,799
and know it will work.

130
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,079
We ran that with surveys.

131
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,879
We ran that with focus group.

132
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,319
Everybody says it won't work

133
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,079
and it works like a charm.

134
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,319
Because sometimes,

135
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,159
it's about good intuition

136
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,479
and believing in something that's logical

137
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,879
and going with it all the way.

138
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,239
Sometimes your customers

139
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,919
are not believing.

140
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,319
They go for the pay as you go

141
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,159
and you say: okay, let's try packages,

142
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,479
or say: no, we don't work packages.

143
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,359
But when the packages come

144
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,239
and are offered to them,

145
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,919
they go for packages.

146
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,239
So, you just have to try.

147
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,559
A lot of the time

148
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,639
you just have to try

149
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,764
and know that you're going to fail,

150
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:08,039
sometimes miserably,

151
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,359
but you just have to try

152
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,239
and give it a good try

153
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,319
every once in a while.

154
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,159
Go against everything.

155
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,960
Everybody says and try a new concept.

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,240
Because this not only benefits

157
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,680
the organization,

158
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,759
it also benefits yourself.

159
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,080
You know that sometimes

160
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,560
you have to try something new.

161
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,080
You go against the flow.

162
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,599
Fail and sometimes

163
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,759
you get great success

164
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,680
and you understand that

165
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,039
it's not always about harvesting it

166
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,759
from the Excels and from the customers,

167
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,119
it's also about finding the ideas

168
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,880
that will generate later on

169
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,399
good growth options.

170
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,560
100%.

171
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:52,233
Yeah.

172
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:54,879
And I have to ask because

173
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,199
in Cellcom, one of the incredible

174
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,319
positions that you've held,

175
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,399
which is fascinating to me,

176
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,039
is customer retention, right?

177
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,959
And I know from living in Israel

178
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,824
how competitive this industry is.

179
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:10,679
So, can you tell me a little bit about Cellcom

180
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,999
and what was really

181
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,839
your position going into this role,

182
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,039
which is incredibly,

183
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,239
incredibly difficult,

184
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,399
incredibly competitive?

185
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,359
So, tell me a little bit about

186
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,840
what it was like.

187
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,279
So, it was not only the greatest

188
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,759
the better part I think,

189
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,399
of working the marketing,

190
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,559
of being in charge of retention.

191
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,200
But the timing was

192
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,480
an unbelievably amazing timing

193
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,920
because at the time,

194
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:41,719
the minister of communication

195
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,000
cancelled the living fees.

196
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,839
So, actually there were no barriers

197
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,719
into moving from one company

198
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,679
to the other.

199
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,280
And if this has happened,

200
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,760
I think in about two or three months,

201
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,240
we knew it was coming.

202
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:04,159
We didn't believe it was coming.

203
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,319
We prepared ourselves.

204
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,879
But once it came,

205
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,719
it started an unbelievably

206
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,239
fierce war price between

207
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,639
the companies because suddenly,

208
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,239
there were no barriers

209
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,479
to leaving any companies.

210
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,999
You had the number,

211
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,040
there were no fines,

212
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,559
hallelujah.

213
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,519
And in I think in two months,

214
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,640
the prices dropped in 200, 300%

215
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:36,919
And the term was unbelievable.

216
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,000
And add new MVNOs,

217
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,879
going into the game

218
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,879
and they had nothing to lose.

219
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,039
Again, for all they know,

220
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,399
they can name a price tag of 19 shekels,

221
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,759
which is like, I don't know,

222
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,399
six, eight dollars and they'll gain.

223
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,000
And also the regulatory procedures

224
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,760
allow them, really encourage them

225
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:04,999
to add as many subscribers

226
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,839
as they can until such a time

227
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,999
where if they have this amount,

228
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,639
they'll be able to go further.

229
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,439
So, everything was laid out

230
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,239
to good, healthy, unbelievable price war.

231
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,199
And this happened overnight.

232
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,519
And what you do is you form

233
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,160
what you say,

234
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,399
you form a war room

235
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,479
which convenes every day at 12.

236
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,399
You have to look at the numbers.

237
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,479
You have to identify

238
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,599
where you get the most journaled out

239
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,959
and what are you going to do in return.

240
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,399
And Cellcom is a big company.

241
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,039
At the time it was 5,000, seven.

242
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,239
A very large company.

243
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,399
And, you know, the large companies

244
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,640
are not in the habit

245
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,560
of working very fast.

246
00:09:57,561 --> 00:09:59,719
But this was, I think,

247
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,319
a defining moment for Cellcom,

248
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,240
because you actually saw

249
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,160
how a very large company

250
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
working very slowly

251
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,520
and very methodically

252
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:14,119
can convene at 12 PM

253
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,959
and decide that

254
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,999
this is a price plan

255
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,799
that will give the best solution.

256
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,919
And by five o'clock,

257
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,680
You have the price plan in place

258
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,080
after going all through

259
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:30,039
so many people and development

260
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,799
and you have the price plan in place

261
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,879
and you're ready

262
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,240
for 8 AM next day to launch it.

263
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,919
This is how things

264
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,959
should happen everywhere.

265
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,519
And this is where I go.

266
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,840
And this is where, personally,

267
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:47,759
I get the kick out of.

268
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,199
You know, I said that in Cellcom,

269
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,520
the best thing that

270
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,640
you came around 8 AM,

271
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,560
you said, okay, I need to do this,

272
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,160
that this is how I do it.

273
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,080
But by 11, and always,

274
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:01,799
11 AM was a magic moment.

275
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,559
Something happened.

276
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,959
Something happened that you went,

277
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,760
Oh, no. What am I doing next?

278
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,480
And you had to really

279
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,080
make a handstand

280
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,000
and forget everything you wanted

281
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,760
to do by that point

282
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,600
and try and do something else

283
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,280
just to match reality.

284
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,480
Unbelievable.

285
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:26,319
So, this was that period.

286
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,799
And it was an awesome period, really.

287
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,039
So much adrenaline.

288
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,399
So much excitement.

289
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,359
Really working around the clock.

290
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,200
But really, this is a magic moment

291
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,800
for any company

292
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,519
and for every professional

293
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,754
where you actually feel

294
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:46,679
that you have no limits.

295
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,959
And things you thought

296
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,400
that cannot be done can be done.

297
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,600
Everything can be done.

298
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,840
If can just put your mind to it.

299
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,640
100%.

300
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,080
Yeah.

301
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,400
And from that point on,

302
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:05,560
the loyalty policy actually changed

303
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,240
180 degrees.

304
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
Because up to that point,

305
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,520
we've had big loyalty programs

306
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,640
and large campaigns

307
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,760
and great benefits.

308
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,000
And it was all about

309
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:25,359
surprise and delight.

310
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,199
You know, now you have

311
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,399
this amazing benefit

312
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,279
and you can take out

313
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,520
all your friends out for breakfast

314
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,320
on our expense,

315
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,160
or you can buy books

316
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:37,159
for very low prices.

317
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,440
That was the policy

318
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:41,559
up to that point.

319
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,759
And the policy

320
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,000
from that point onward,

321
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,440
because it was obvious

322
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,680
that people no longer

323
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:49,297
found it interesting, they said,

324
00:12:49,497 --> 00:12:51,760
okay, just give me the best price.

325
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,440
And let me be.

326
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,640
Don't call me.

327
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,880
Don't give me benefits.

328
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,120
I'm not interested.

329
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,320
Just give me the best price.

330
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:03,479
Because that was what energized

331
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,399
the market at that point.

332
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,239
Right.

333
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,479
And from that point on,

334
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,279
it was a lot about the service,

335
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,319
the ongoing service

336
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,119
and the ongoing relationship between

337
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,279
the subscriber,

338
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,079
the customer and ourselves.

339
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,159
It was about bringing values

340
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:33,960
of being very honest, very outgoing.

341
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,719
The saying Hebrew shakuf, transparency.

342
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,199
And that was a value

343
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,279
that became very important

344
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,759
during that time.

345
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,239
I'm Sure.

346
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,280
No more you know,

347
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:49,279
complicated price plans,

348
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,599
no more services, add-on services.

349
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,119
Being very transparent

350
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,599
to our subscribers,

351
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,399
create one magic word,

352
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,199
which is trust.

353
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,799
100%.

354
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,559
And that's where you get loyalty.

355
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,679
I think that just phenomenal.

356
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,319
Yeah.

357
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,959
And that's a challenge.

358
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,240
I have to ask you because

359
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,159
I'm fascinated also

360
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,719
by your work with Zap.

361
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,759
I love Zap.

362
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,679
It's a group that has three subgroups

363
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,040
that you were in charge of also

364
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,119
their marketing.

365
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,599
Rest.co.il, Mishlohim and Mitchatnim.

366
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,679
And so tell me what lessons

367
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,519
did you bring with you

368
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,799
from Cellcom and Bezeq

369
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,759
as you're transitioning

370
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,959
to be director of marketing

371
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,119
for these very different companies?

372
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,399
Right?

373
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,159
They're not the same.

374
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,319
It's not the same customer experience.

375
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,799
It's not always the same customers.

376
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,599
So, what lessons did you bring in

377
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,479
and what new challenges

378
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,360
did you have to face?

379
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,319
Yes.

380
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,720
So, that was actually the Israeli yelp.

381
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,399
The challenge there,

382
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,199
it's always about

383
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,919
the marketing challenge.

384
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,999
And the marketing challenge there

385
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,159
was actually going both ways.

386
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,679
It's a B2B challenge because

387
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,719
you work, the advertisers

388
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,439
are small, medium businesses in Israel,

389
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,227
which I knew very well from my time

390
00:15:17,228 --> 00:15:20,199
working in Cellcom and Bezeq.

391
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,439
But also, it's the Israeli crowd.

392
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,239
You have to please the people

393
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,239
that will eventually coming to rest,

394
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,919
coming to deliveries,

395
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,399
coming to the wedding website.

396
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,279
So, it's a double side challenge.

397
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,439
And this is the part where

398
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,439
I can talk for hours and hours.

399
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,999
But it's also about finding

400
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,959
how everything into meet,

401
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,239
finding how I give the,

402
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,599
the people who come to the website

403
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,159
a definite value.

404
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,999
And we did that actually in Rest first

405
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,359
and then onwards for Mishlohim

406
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,039
by personalization.

407
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,919
And you think personalization

408
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,919
it's so obvious,

409
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,959
but to check a website,

410
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,959
that was just a restaurant website

411
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,679
with ratings and nice pictures

412
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,360
and making it into a website

413
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,560
that actually, when you come in,

414
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,160
Michael, and when I come in,

415
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:26,159
we see two different websites.

416
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,359
You get the recommendations for you,

417
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,519
you get the content

418
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,999
that will match your needs.

419
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,839
And I get that different content,

420
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,559
different recommendations.

421
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,679
And by adding personalization

422
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,319
into these websites,

423
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,959
we actually prove the win-win situation.

424
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,640
More surface came in,

425
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:48,119
a lot more surface came in,

426
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,159
the website SEO went up the roof

427
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,359
and our advertisers were happy.

428
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,399
Because not only

429
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,919
we brought more traffic,

430
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,079
we brought more relevant

431
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,599
traffic for them.

432
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,916
And when you ask

433
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:05,519
what connects

434
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,999
Zap group, and you know,

435
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,079
the Israeli Yelp and Cellcom,

436
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,839
it's about identifying the needs.

437
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,679
It's always about that.

438
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,799
Identifying the needs

439
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,519
and talking to the customers

440
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,039
and really understanding

441
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,199
what makes everybody ticks

442
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,559
and going on from there,

443
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,680
developing the product that would

444
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,159
best suit everybody's needs.

445
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,039
And also for me, it's technology.

446
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,079
So, I'm a big fan

447
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,080
of everything that's techie.

448
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,720
And really, when you see

449
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:45,599
the last 20 years

450
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,919
and what technology brought in

451
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,720
for marketing,

452
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,840
this is a small time revolution.

453
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,440
Because we went on

454
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,080
from starting out

455
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,440
from just having surveys

456
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:01,199
and measuring traffic

457
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,199
into really having concise insights

458
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,119
into the buyer persona

459
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,720
and having immediate,

460
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,840
which is awesome immediate feedback

461
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,040
about how campaigns are going.

462
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,800
And not going into one big campaign,

463
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,040
but going into 20, 30,

464
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,680
sometimes 100 micro campaigns

465
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,720
and just optimizing as we go

466
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,720
and seeing what works best for us.

467
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,400
So, this is also one thing in common.

468
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,240
It's technology

469
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:35,359
and how you can use it

470
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,999
to be a better marketer

471
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,919
and to develop better products

472
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,399
and making your customers happy,

473
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,040
which is the basic

474
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,120
for every loyal customer.

475
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,320
Right.

476
00:18:47,321 --> 00:18:48,439
I think what I'm taking away

477
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,879
from this is primarily,

478
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,799
really the art behind marketing

479
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,520
and really the perspective

480
00:18:54,521 --> 00:18:55,359
of really understanding

481
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,599
what makes people tick

482
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,399
and really what they're looking for

483
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,159
and forming this relationship,

484
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,319
not just with your customers,

485
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,680
but forming this relationship with

486
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,800
what you're marketing,

487
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,240
and the product that you're using,

488
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,320
that you're using to market because

489
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,680
that relationship it sounds

490
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,240
that you have to really be transparent

491
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,040
and honest with it

492
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,999
in order for it to come out authentic

493
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,639
and to really gain

494
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,439
the loyalty and trust of the customers.

495
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,639
Shirley, 20 minutes go by so fast.

496
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,599
And I want to thank you for being

497
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,239
so generous with your time.

498
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,679
It's unbelievable.

499
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,399
But we do have

500
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,319
the most important question.

501
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,719
We have the most important question,

502
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,599
which is three words

503
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,920
that you would use to describe yourself.

504
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,919
Okay. So, disclaimer,

505
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,439
I did think about it ahead of time.

506
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,759
Curious.

507
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,199
First thing is curious,

508
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,199
I'm impossible

509
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,519
on the bordering of really going

510
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,959
into every detail, people.

511
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,999
That's the most interesting thing.

512
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,919
You should know,

513
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,640
you know, how many interviews

514
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,120
have you had so far, over 200.

515
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,240
That's the most interesting thing,

516
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,640
talking to people

517
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,800
and learning things that are on YouTube.

518
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,920
So curious, energetic.

519
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,520
I think it came across, you know.

520
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,400
Bring it all.

521
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:14,919
I love being in good dynamic places.

522
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,159
And the last thing

523
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,319
that I'm very hands on,

524
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,599
you know, I really like

525
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,559
to get my hands dirty.

526
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,199
I will always be the one who goes,

527
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,879
oh, let me handle that.

528
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,205
Because you do learn things

529
00:20:30,405 --> 00:20:33,160
by your own experience.

530
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,440
Don't go too far away from

531
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:36,839
where everything happens.

532
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,199
Get your hands dirty.

533
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,959
Because that's where you really learn.

534
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,479
I love it.

535
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,519
Shirley, thank you very much.

536
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,439
Toda raba.

537
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,239
Best of luck

538
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,439
with your continuing great work

539
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,359
with marketing direction.

540
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,240
And thank you for the inspiration

541
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,400
over these past 20 minutes.

542
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,800
Thank you very much.

543
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,680
Have a good one.

544
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,240
Bye bye.
