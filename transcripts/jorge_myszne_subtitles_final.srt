24
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,000
All right, Jorge Myszne,

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,120
thank you so much for joining us

26
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,240
on 20 Minute Leaders.

27
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,790
Thank you.

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,640
Thank you for having me.

29
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,680
So great to have you.

30
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,560
We know each other from

31
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,080
the J-Ventures Fund.

32
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,080
And I just love how I get to meet

33
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,560
all these incredible people

34
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,360
through this capitalistic Kibbutz.

35
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,080
Jorge, you have a fascinating story

36
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,000
which I can't wait to hear on this show

37
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,080
about your journey from Uruguay

38
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,560
to Israel to the US.

39
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,720
The startup that you sold to Qualcomm.

40
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,800
Your amazing work

41
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,440
at Intel and on WiFi

42
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,480
and things that I have no idea about.

43
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,840
And finally about your new startup

44
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,000
which, as you mentioned,

45
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,280
you grinding on which I love.

46
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,760
Jorge, who are you?

47
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,640
Give me the rundown.

48
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,920
Okay. So, originally I was born in Uruguay

49
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,800
in South America.

50
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,120
And then got married

51
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,440
and moved to Israel when I was 26.

52
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,800
And started to work at Intel,

53
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,960
at the WiFi team at Intel.

54
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,800
When I got there, we were kind of

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,800
a small startup inside Intel.

56
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,360
So, I think we were about 30 people.

57
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,680
And then fast forward 2007

58
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,680
I left Intel to start my first startup

59
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,640
and we were about 1500

60
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,080
I think at Intel at that time

61
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,720
on the WiFi team.

62
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,240
And after the Centrino and after

63
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,840
the whole revolution of WiFi

64
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,640
and went with other three partners

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,080
and we started Wilocity,

66
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:38,320
It was 60 gigahertz WiFi chipset company.

67
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,200
And together with that company,

68
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,720
in 2010, so I moved to the Bay Area

69
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,200
to start the operations here

70
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,680
in the Bay Area.

71
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,800
And then 2014, Qualcomm acquired us. Moved to Qualcomm

72
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,240
Wait wait wait. Jorge, the transition

73
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,000
from Uruguay to Israel,

74
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,960
not that common.

75
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,800
Going straight into Intel,

76
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,920
what was that about?

77
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,400
So, you get married and you decide

78
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,280
to just move your whole life to Israel.

79
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah, actually.

80
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,880
So, I started in Uruguay.

81
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,280
I did my undergrad and second degree

82
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,120
a master's degree there.

83
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,240
And I always wanted to go to Israel

84
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,520
and move to Israel.

85
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,160
So, I had the opportunity when I was 18

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,640
to go because Uruguay's in the south.

87
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:31,920
So, the scholar year is the opposite.

88
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,360
Right.

89
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,040
So, when I was about to start in Israel,

90
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,520
so, I already did half a year

91
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,040
in college in Uruguay.

92
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,080
So you know it's just a bunch of excuses.

93
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:45,760
Why not?

94
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,520
But then I said,

95
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,320
"Okay, well I already started,

96
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,880
so let's make it here, etc."

97
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,960
So, bottom line, I just finished there.

98
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,800
And that was the next stage

99
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,560
and the next phase when I could say,

100
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,120
"Okay, that's the time."

101
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,560
So, with my current wife,

102
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,640
so, we said, "Okay, let's go."

103
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,120
So, actually we got married

104
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,440
and a month later we were in Israel

105
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,920
sleeping on,

106
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,400
eating on the floor.

107
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,520
Wonderful.

108
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,520
And you joined Intel,

109
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,600
you joined the WiFi team

110
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,960
during the WiFi revolution.

111
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,560
What was that like working on technologies

112
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,040
that really shape how we interface

113
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,000
with the world today,

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,960
especially my generation?

115
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,080
Yeah, it was great.

116
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,200
And I think it was a great journey.

117
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,080
And coming from a big company

118
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,640
and seeing how that evolved.

119
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,520
It was great.

120
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,640
So, it started with

121
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,560
kind of one megabit per second

122
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,560
and it was kind of a big revolution

123
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,560
just to get one megabit per second.

124
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,880
And then it becomes that great thing

125
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,600
with all the operation at some point.

126
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,920
I was in charge of one

127
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,720
of the generations

128
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,960
and we were manufacturing

129
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,480
50 million chipsets a year.

130
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,240
And it was really great and

131
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,400
especially when Intel decided to go

132
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,040
all in with the Centrino

133
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,960
and made the WiFi part

134
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,600
of the branding of the Centrino

135
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,480
and getting, at that time was McDonald's,

136
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,680
getting hot spots in McDonald's

137
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,560
because, of course, you need both sides.

138
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,120
That was great.

139
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,040
And just going everywhere and

140
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,200
just the pride of going somewhere

141
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:34,520
and say

142
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,360
"Ah, that is the chip that I designed."

143
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,960
That was pretty fun.

144
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,440
Amazing. Amazing. Okay.

145
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,120
And then from there,

146
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,200
you go with a few partners

147
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,120
and you move on to Wilocity.

148
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,360
And there you developed technology

149
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,000
that you actually sell to Qualcomm.

150
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,920
Right?

151
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,880
Yeah.

152
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
So what was that like?

153
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,400
Moving from a huge corporation

154
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,120
like Intel and going to create

155
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,080
a startup which is you said,

156
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,000
60 gigahertz?

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,480
Yeah.

158
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,850
So, the way WiFi works

159
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,240
it's bands there are free,

160
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,240
ISM bands.

161
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,400
So, 2.4 and 5 gigahertz

162
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,560
are bands that everybody can use.

163
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:18,000
And at some point the FCCs of the world

164
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,120
just took 60, a band around 60 gigahertz,

165
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,560
and said, "Okay, this band is now ISM."

166
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,080
And the reason for that is because

167
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,360
of the size of the molecules of oxygen.

168
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,520
So, there is more absorption than

169
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,320
even in higher frequencies.

170
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,120
So, basically, nobody wants to use it.

171
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,360
It's not a good frequency to use

172
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,480
because of there is a lot of loss.

173
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,360
So, that's why they said,

174
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,600
"Okay, you know what?

175
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,280
Whoever wants to use it, can use it."

176
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,200
And that's when we said,

177
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,600
"Okay. We need to use it for indoor

178
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,120
so not very long range."

179
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,960
But because of the real estate

180
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
that you have there,

181
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,680
the bandwidth that you have there.

182
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,040
So, you can go very, very,

183
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,600
wide.

184
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,640
That means very, very fast.

185
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,120
So, our first product was

186
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,640
4.6 gigabits per second.

187
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,280
Wow.

188
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,760
And today, the ...

189
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
goes all the way to

190
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,560
100 gigabits per second. Wireless.

191
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,200
Incredible.

192
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,640
And then what were you doing at Qualcomm?

193
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,280
So, when we were acquired by Qualcomm,

194
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,880
so basically, a couple of years earlier,

195
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,440
Qualcomm acquired another

196
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,120
company called Atheros.

197
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,440
That was the big WiFi and became

198
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,920
a big communications company,

199
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,760
not just WiFi at some point.

200
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,720
So, when they acquired Atheros,

201
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,240
actually, they became kind of

202
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,120
the communications group inside Qualcomm.

203
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,720
So when we were acquired,

204
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,400
we merged into the Atheros group

205
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,200
and basically took over the products

206
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,840
of Wilocity inside Qualcomm

207
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,800
and just merging to the communications team

208
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:19,200
and build the whole combo of WiFi and WiGig,

209
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,400
that is the name of

210
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,960
60 gigahertz technology, etc.

211
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,240
Wow. That's very very interesting.

212
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,240
And now fast forward to today.

213
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,000
You're acting both as an angel investor

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,880
as part of J-Ventures,

215
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,600
but you're also

216
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,160
running your own company.

217
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,080
I'd love to hear about this tension

218
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,600
between these two things.

219
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,160
So on one hand,

220
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
we meet on a monthly basis,

221
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,680
before physically now virtually,

222
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,280
to look at different startups

223
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
and different opportunities.

224
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,080
Yet you yourself

225
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,080
are acting the same role

226
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,720
as the entrepreneurs we're evaluating.

227
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,040
So, how does that play out?

228
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,280
It's actually kind of funny

229
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,360
because sometimes you are

230
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,440
on one side of the table

231
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,720
and others you are

232
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,400
on the other side of the table.

233
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,800
So you learn to, actually you learn a lot

234
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,120
from being on both sides

235
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,640
of the table.

236
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,280
Of course.

237
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,800
So you know as an entrepreneur,

238
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,160
when you act as the VC.

239
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,000
So, you understand

240
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,240
what they are looking for.

241
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,760
So, you know how to sell

242
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,920
your pitch better on one side.

243
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,080
On the flip side you understand also the guy

244
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,920
that is coming and pitching to you

245
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,880
probably for the first,

246
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,400
usually at J-Ventures for the first time

247
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,520
or the first initial phases,

248
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,840
so you try to actually,

249
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,800
you try to help them.

250
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:47,120
So I find myself a lot of times

251
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,600
just whether we decide to invest

252
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,400
as a fund or myself personally,

253
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,760
just helping them.

254
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,720
And it happened in several cases.

255
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,160
For example, one of the companies

256
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,520
that we have that could have

257
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,080
a relationship in South America.

258
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,640
So, I connected them

259
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,080
with some companies that I know

260
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,440
and tried to get them going. Right.

261
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,840
So, you appreciate much more both sides.

262
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,480
Right. And well, you use the intel

263
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,720
that you get on both sides

264
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,880
when you are on the other side.

265
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,920
100%.

266
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,520
I'm getting so much

267
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,800
insight and inspiration myself

268
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,240
coming in as a student and an engineer

269
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,000
and I'm going to be an entrepreneur

270
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,320
hopefully soon.

271
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,160
And hopefully pitching to funds

272
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,120
and angel groups like J-Ventures.

273
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:42,680
And I think that just understanding

274
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,680
the questions that are being asked.

275
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,760
It's so phenomenal.

276
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,400
And it's really humbling to see

277
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,920
how many different things you can think of

278
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,640
and what are the common pitfalls

279
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,400
and how much you can learn

280
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,920
from every single person,

281
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,360
like I'm learning from you

282
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,720
through J-Ventures.

283
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,920
So it's really, really great.

284
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,800
Kameleon, talk to me a little bit about that.

285
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,040
Kameleon is the latest one.

286
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,400
So after I took some time off -

287
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,960
The latest adventure.

288
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,440
Yeah.

289
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,880
So, I took some time off

290
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,800
After a long time that I was grinding.

291
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,000
I took some time off.

292
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,480
Spent some time with the family.

293
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,520
We had a great road trip

294
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,440
across the US from coast to coast.

295
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,600
So, at some point I said,

296
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,560
"Okay, now it's time to go back

297
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,640
to the trenches."

298
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,960
So actually I partnered

299
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,400
with two other guys.

300
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,080
One of them is also a guy

301
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,600
that I worked with at Wilocity.

302
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,400
And we started Kameleon

303
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,680
We are trying to solve

304
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,160
the cyber-security problem

305
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,880
but from the foundation.

306
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,640
So there is a lot of companies

307
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,000
working on the cyberspace.

308
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,480
But we see that basically

309
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,320
at the end of the day,

310
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,000
all the software

311
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,320
runs on top of hardware.

312
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,920
And that hardware

313
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,040
was never designed for security.

314
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,240
So it's a patch

315
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,200
on top of a patch

316
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,800
on top of a patch.

317
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,040
And what we see is that

318
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,080
unless you build a strong base,

319
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,520
doesn't matter what you build on top,

320
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,280
at the end of the day

321
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,400
you can always come underneath.

322
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,520
Right.

323
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,800
So, this is what we are doing.

324
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,120
And basically, Kamaleon is building

325
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,480
what we call the SPU.

326
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,040
It's a security processing unit

327
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,320
that is a companion device to any system

328
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,760
but in particular, right now,

329
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,400
we are working on PCs and servers

330
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,560
and protect the system from time zero.

331
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,560
So, all the boot of the system

332
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,800
and then during runtime,

333
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,640
and isolates completely

334
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,480
the attackers from the defenders

335
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,200
and gives a very secure environment

336
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,480
for the defenders

337
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,640
where they can trust.

338
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,840
And trust here is a big, big word.

339
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,880
They can trust what they see.

340
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,880
They cannot be fooled.

341
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,160
And they get full visibility

342
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,720
on the system,

343
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,240
how it's working and what's going on.

344
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,440
Is that why it's called Kameleon

345
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,480
because it can change its color

346
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,080
based on what you want it to,

347
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,520
so that it blends with the environment?

348
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:28,960
Yeah.

349
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,560
So, one of the applications

350
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,800
that we are also doing is what it's called

351
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,640
Moving Target Defense.

352
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,920
And basically, what you do

353
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,000
is you change the memory map

354
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,200
of the of the software

355
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,440
that it's running in runtime.

356
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,360
So, that's where the Kameleon is coming.

357
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,680
We move things around

358
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,400
so when attacker wants to

359
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
attack the system,

360
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,560
they don't know where,

361
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,840
basically where the entrance is

362
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,640
So, you are moving the windows

363
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,800
and the doors all the time. Right.

364
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,080
So, when they try to get into the house,

365
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,480
they don't know where to enter from.

366
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,560
Right. That makes a lot of sense.

367
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,760
And I have to ask,

368
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,040
going from corporate to startup

369
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,800
to corporate to now investor,

370
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,760
what are some things

371
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,400
that you're bringing with you

372
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,760
into this newest venture

373
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,080
because you must be approaching this

374
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,680
with a little bit more insight,

375
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,960
if not a lot more insight

376
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,040
than you had before.

377
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,840
So what are some of the key things

378
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,800
that you and your partner set out

379
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,280
and you knew off the bat

380
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,280
that perhaps Jorge of Wilocity

381
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,720
in its early days didn't know?

382
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,280
I think that working on both sides,

383
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,560
on small companies and on big companies,

384
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:49,560
you understand the motivations

385
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,960
behind what people do.

386
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,800
At the end of the day,

387
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
you deal with people.

388
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,480
You do business with people.

389
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:55,840
Right.

390
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,520
Doesn't matter if it's Intel,

391
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,400
Qualcomm, Wilocity.

392
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,440
Small, big, medium. It's all the same.

393
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,800
At the end of the day,

394
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,160
you need to try and understand

395
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,160
what is driving that person.

396
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,320
What is the level of risk

397
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,800
that he's willing to take and why?

398
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,200
So having worked in big companies,

399
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,040
small companies, usually Americans,

400
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,000
but doesn't necessarily need to be.

401
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:32,880
You get to, at least, understand or recognize

402
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,800
what are the things that drive people.

403
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,680
What is the all the,

404
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,600
especially in the corporate,

405
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,840
so, the internal politics at the corporate.

406
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,160
And who are the right people to talk to.

407
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,360
What is that you need to offer.

408
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,160
Find the person that can help you -

409
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,840
You know I think it's so cool

410
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,840
that you're dealing with

411
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,800
the very low level of technology,

412
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,520
very hard core technology,

413
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,480
yet when I ask you about the things

414
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,640
that you're taking with you

415
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,880
from your previous experiences,

416
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,880
you're not saying

417
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,680
I'm taking more knowledge and

418
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,000
more expertise in that domain.

419
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,360
But you're saying I'm taking

420
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,000
the understanding that at the end

421
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,840
it's all about people

422
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,000
and it's all about relationships, right?

423
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,760
Yeah. And at the end of the day if you want,

424
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,680
even though it's still silicon

425
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,080
and semiconductor,

426
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,560
I was doing communications.

427
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,160
Now it's security. It's systems.

428
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:28,520
So it's the expertise you know

429
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,000
You can always find good people

430
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,200
and build a good team,

431
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,720
but at the end of the day,

432
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,120
you need to know how to build

433
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,360
the whole system,

434
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,760
especially when you are

435
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,040
trying to change some conventions, right.

436
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:46,280
When I talk about cyber-security,

437
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,360
nobody thinks about hardware.

438
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
Everybody thinks about software,

439
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,400
antivirus or whatever.

440
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:53,960
Right.

441
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:59,560
So, just shifting, making that part of the timeshift

442
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,560
it's not trivial.

443
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,400
And at the end of the day,

444
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,120
you need to find the right people

445
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,920
that are willing to take that leap of faith

446
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,550
with you.

447
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,550
And the risk, of course.

448
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:11,960
Right, and say

449
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,960
"Okay, we need to fix this

450
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,840
from the foundation.

451
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,000
We need to build the right foundation."

452
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,040
And it's not another feature,

453
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,960
and if it's white or black or whatever.

454
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,200
Right. Are there more,

455
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:28,040
I'm trying to think of things

456
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,480
that I would wanna take for myself

457
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,160
as I approach my own ventures later on

458
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,800
and my own experiences

459
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,840
in the tech industry.

460
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,480
What are some of the earned secrets

461
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,790
that you've accumulated over the years

462
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,920
in terms of the products that you're building

463
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,600
and communicating with customers

464
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,600
and with different people?

465
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,960
I think at the end of the day,

466
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,800
you need to be very careful

467
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,040
not to get in love with the technology,

468
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,480
but have a technology

469
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,440
that solves a real problem.

470
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,640
Okay.

471
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,560
The technology is the consequence

472
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,720
and not the compass, right.

473
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,080
So you need to be very, very careful.

474
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,520
As a technical people

475
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,600
we always fall in love

476
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,030
with the technology.

477
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,920
But at the end of the day

478
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,920
when you go to a potential customer,

479
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,510
you need to understand their pain

480
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,800
and see how the technology

481
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,030
solves their pain and not just,

482
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,550
"Well, this is cool.

483
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,440
This technology is really cool."

484
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:26,160
So, I think that this is

485
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,320
probably the main thing in terms of

486
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,480
what you do with your things when

487
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,160
and being upfront.

488
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,160
I think it's the other one.

489
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,440
As a startup, you are always

490
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,440
with less resources than you want

491
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,640
and you are always

492
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,080
probably promising a little bit

493
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,400
more than what you really have.

494
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:55,160
And it's kind of a

495
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,030
...

496
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,520
So while I think it's okay, I mean,

497
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,440
everybody understands that.

498
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,720
You need to be very, very upfront.

499
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,040
You don't want to put your

500
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,640
potential customers and your champions

501
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,110
inside a company in a bad position.

502
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,400
So you need to be very, very open

503
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,720
and develop that relationship with them

504
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,880
so they know what they have

505
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,000
and they can help you manage that

506
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,640
and navigate the company.

507
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,270
They know that better than you.

508
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,270
I love it. I love it.

509
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,680
Jorge, we almost have to end,

510
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,720
but I have to ask you my favorite question.

511
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,960
Three words that you would use

512
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,960
to describe yourself

513
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,080
or that your co-founders

514
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,480
from either startup would use

515
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,720
to describe you as.

516
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,590
Three words.

517
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,520
Three words.

518
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,160
Adventurous.

519
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,600
Okay.

520
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,200
I've been going up and down,

521
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,720
right and left and things that I didn't

522
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,786
know exactly how they will end.

523
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,130
Grit.

524
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,440
Okay.

525
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,600
Sometimes, people always ask me

526
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,000
why I left a big corporate

527
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,480
with a big salary

528
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,720
and go back to the trenches.

529
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,240
But that's what I like.

530
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,790
And the third one I think it's

531
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,790
citizen of the world.

532
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,320
Having lived in three countries now,

533
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,720
at least 10 years on each,

534
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,110
you get a little bit of each one with you.

535
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,240
And you are always missing

536
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,030
a little bit of each one.

537
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,920
I love it. I love it.

538
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:30,830
Wonderful.

539
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,560
Jorge, thank you so much

540
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,320
for the inspiration and

541
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:32,920
for the time.

542
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,550
I really appreciate it.

543
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,720
And best of luck with Kameleon.

544
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,440
Great. Happy to be here.

545
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,030
Thank you.

546
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,120
Toda raba. Bye Bye.
