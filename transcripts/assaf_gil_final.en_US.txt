1 And I think in order to, to make a break out format, you really need to be extremely original and sort of break the barriers of a lot of things that have been done before. Assaf Gil, thank you for joining me on my show. How are you? Not too bad. Thanks very much. You know, I'm not used to seeing your face. I'm used to seeing the title of your company at the end of pretty much every show that I enjoy watching on TV. So, it's definitely an interesting experience now watching you in person. But Assaf, Gil, obviously is the last name. But what's really, I think, fascinating to me is that you really are a key figure in the entertainment industry in Israel. And I think that's what I'm especially curious to hear about in these next 20 minutes, is some of the thought process that goes behind creating entertainment, bringing that to reality and really productizing it for the market here in Israel. So, Assaf, please take it away and tell me a little bit about your journey. And how do you even get started with even wanting to be on television? If I'm correct, I would say Ladim was one of the first appearances. Yes. Well, I actually, I wasn't born a producer. I started out as an actor. I trained in London for four years. And then when coming back to Israel, I acted in theater and a business television here. After which, I sort of decided that it wasn't it for me, which I'm really happy about that decision, because unlike other would-be actors or people who wanted it and never achieved it, I was really through with my wish to be an actor. So, once that happened to me, I was really dedicated to producing. And I think one of the key issues in my career at least, was the fact that the success, or as you mentioned, the fact that I'm almost everywhere on television in Israel as a producer, didn't come to me very quickly. I think that for about 15 years, I was producing sort of small shows, getting, you know, learning quite a lot through the process of working. And only at the tender age of 43, I think, I really hit the prime time in commercial television in Israel, which really was a big breakthrough for me and from the word goal. Since I was on prime time, i was very fortunate to have a huge success in almost every show I produced. Assaf, I have to pick your brain about this whole industry because coming from the tech scene, you know, I think the equivalent to you saying reaching prime time is sort of reaching like an exit for a startup sort or going public. That's sort of like the, I guess, the analogy. But talk to me a little bit about how this industry is built and what are some of the biggest challenges that it takes for a producer to reach at the tender age of 43, to reach that prime time experience? Well, you know, television in Israel is a small marketplace. And it's extremely competitive because there's a large number of production companies with a limited amount of networks. So, that makes it very tough. Actually, throughout the years, i don't think it became any easier. It only it feels like sort of a big war going through the years. And first and foremost, I must say that the battle is for great shows, great ideas, formats, if they are sort of purchase for Israel, IP that is purchased to be produced locally from successful shows elsewhere. And also, here and there when we do have the chance to create our own original shows and IP. Right. That makes a lot of sense. And talk to me a little bit about what is a format? So, I'm guessing that it's some structure to a show that might repeat itself, might be able to then scale also to other places. But just talk to me a little bit, because you have both the Gil Production side and Gil Formats. Right? Which are, they're like siblings entities. But talk to me about each one separately and how they work together here in the Israeli marketplace. Sure. So, basically, the formats I'm talking about or the formats that we're dealing with are non scripted formats. So, we're not talking about scripted shows. We're talking about non-scripted television. And the format is basically a very comprehensive concept, which is very well defined. And, you know, impossible to imitate, if you like, without going into lawsuits. And it's always starting out as an idea and then being developed further and further, sometimes, through violent episodes, sometimes it's being commissioned. And Gil Productions is really a pure production entity that currently in the Israeli marketplace, we're producing six really huge shows for all networks here. And Gil Formats was established as a company in 2015 because we came to realize that we have a lot of our own original stuff that we would like to distribute and sell outside of Israel. And we made some very nice successes through this IP, this original IP. Some of it was produced initially in Israel and then exported. And some was actually first, produced first outside of Israel. So, that was even more exciting. So, I mean, let's say that I'm a young, a young media entrepreneur and I have an idea for a show that is called Come Eat with Me. By the way, I love that show. And I want to put it on. Come down with me. I want to actually start this up as a real proper show. What are some of the big milestones that I'll have to go through as a media entrepreneur or is coming in with this format, whether I pitch it to Gil Formats or somebody else, what are some of the steps that I'll have to go through? I think that unlike, perhaps tech ideas that might be sometimes easier to launch, I find, because I'm getting pitched on an average of two formats at least a day, so it's hundreds per year. And I must say that most of them are not that good because, You're like a venture capital investor. In a way, I am. Yes. I think that some of the ideas are very, you know, they are very much similar to other things that are on air with slight differences that don't really make that much of a difference. And I think in order to make a break out format, you really need to be extremely original and sort of break the barriers of a lot of things that have been done before. On the other hand, I think that some of the ideas I'm being pitched with are okay, great, actually on paper, but once you go into the nitty gritty of producing them, of making them a television show, most people don't really understand the barriers of television or how a television show is produced. And that's why some of the ideas are purely hypothetical, because they cannot get to a practical you know, they cannot really be achieved. So, it's a really tough process. But if you do have an original successful format, it can potentially bring you lots of money and lots of, you know, it could be a big springboard if you do manage to create something original that could be successful. Right. Talk to me a little bit about reality television. That's also a big part of what you do. Why do I love reality TV so much? Why do I find myself able to sit through watching an entire season of a reality show without stopping? I think that's maybe the only thing I can do without stopping for hours. Why is that? I think that, you know, what always works on television is a story and it's always a personal story and there's always need, there's a need for some sort of stake of what the people are going through. There's a challenge, there's something out of the ordinary. Some of the reality shows that we all know when wanting to achieve the you know, this challenge, for instance, in Survivor, they could send people to a remote island to starve them and put them through impossible challenges just to get the personal story, the personal truth. Some other shows, which I've been also fortunate to produce there the challenge is that naturally, for instance, one of the successful show I produced a few years ago in Israel was called Baby Boom. In the original UK version, it's called One Born Every Minute. And what we did was just document births in a hospital ward. And it was extremely emotional and dramatic, simply just by putting a camera there. Because the challenge was there, we didn't need to create it. Some reality shows have to manipulate and create the challenge and the drama, whereas some of the other shows, the drama is sort of inherent in the process. I prefer the other type of shows because I think that, nowadays, viewers are very critical. They can see the manipulations. And I think that as long as the person involved, the person on television is going through something real, it's better. And I think most of my shows were focus on that. I think that's fascinating and I have to say that I agree. I enjoy watching both the very early seasons of these shows, but I also enjoy watching the later season of these shows and the new reality shows like Baby Boom, which I also love. And you can tell the difference. You can tell the difference in authenticity. And you can tell when that person is going through an emotional experience that is very relevant that you can actually connect with. But Assaf, tell me a little bit about, about the trajectory of where we're headed with television and reality TV also. So, what have been some of the major changes aside from the authenticity in the past decade or so? And where are we headed towards in the future? Well, you know, everyone is talking about the problem of linear television and is it going to still be relevant. I think it is. Because I think the challenge of current day television is television really needs to reinvent itself as a must see platform. You can watch Netflix, you can binge shows and obviously have lots of fun with it. But I think the challenge of linear television is to be able to offer viewers something that they really need to see, they won't be able to see on the SVOD platforms. And I think, I do see a long future of television ahead of us. You know, my recent show in Israel which is a huge success everywhere, The Messenger, is something like that because it is something that has a great deal of engagement with viewers. People need to be involved. They want to be involved. It's the talk the next day, everywhere. And it's the type of show which brings back the value of television. And I think that's part of the things I like to do, because I do like to produce things which are a bit of an adventure, a bit of something refreshing, something different. And I think, that was one of the reasons why I, you know, took an option on this format very early before it launch in the US and some other format as well. When I felt that there is something that is different, there is an adventure in having this on television. And I think that's one of the key issues. Not doing more of the same, doing things which are completely different. Assaf, I think that's just incredible. Tell me a little bit about yourself. Why are you so excited about starting new shows and continuing to innovate? You mentioned that you started off really getting into the bits and pieces and the exciting parts at 43. But why today? Why do you still enjoy getting pitched at least two ideas per day and then continuing to do new formats? You know, I love what I do. It's really not something that when I wake up in the morning, I don't have any qualms about what I'm doing. I don't have other dreams. It's not like I wish I would have, I would do something else. It never, never happened to me. I really am totally enchanted with what I'm doing. And I love to create. And I think part of the magic of creating for television is being able to use a lot of your senses and both intellect and emotions. But I would say first and foremost, intuition. I think television for me, at least, television works a lot on intuition. And that's why I love this field. Because you're going through a lot of unknowns. You're going through a lot of black holes. You're not sure what's going to happen when you know, how you're going to come out of the other side. And that's part of the magic of television. And that's why it's so exciting. And it always has been. What's been the greatest challenge that you had to overcome in doing the amazing work that you're doing right now? Well, the biggest challenges are me pitching to other people, of course. So, you're talking about as if I'm a VC being pitched to, but I'm also pitching to the networks in Israel, I'm pitching to networks abroad, to production companies abroad. That's always a big challenge. Because normally, you're in a position when you're pitching to people who are very anxious about making bold moves and taking risks. And if you are being adventurous, which is what I like to do, it's always a challenge pitching to people who are almost prone to taking risks, risk-verse people. And that's, I would say, my biggest challenge. I love that. And if you look over, you know, the incredible career that you've had, and I have to, first of all, I have to say thank you, because I think that, you know, besides from being an innovator and creating all these things, you really you impacted so many lives. And you know, I can still recall it, and I will never forget those Saturday nights when I would sit with my family, everybody together huddle in front of the screen because we're excited about somebody's journey, whether it's through Baby Boom or another reality TV. I think it brings people together. I think it creates excitement and creates an internal excitement for every person watching it. And I think that allowing us to experience these emotions is a gift. And so, I want to thank you for giving us that gift. And also, thank you for being so generous with your time and coming here. Assaf, before we leave, I have to ask you the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. Well, I'll pick up on a lot of things I said here, I would probably say, it's a bit embarrassing, but I would probably say that I'm intuitive, I'm experienced because it took me some time before I made a move and when successful. And I'm adventurous. These are the three things I can say about me. I love it. Assaf, thank you so, so much. This was really, really wonderful. And thank you very much. Stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you. Thank you very much, Michael. Thank you.
