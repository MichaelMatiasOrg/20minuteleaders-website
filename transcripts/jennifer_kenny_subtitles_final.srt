1
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,480
All right.

2
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,440
Jennifer Kenny, thank you

3
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,120
for being on my show,

4
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,840
20 Minute Leaders.

5
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,640
How are you?

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,400
Very well. Delighted to join in.

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,400
Thank you.

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:43,880
Thank you.

9
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,200
Where are you calling from right now?

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,400
I'm calling from Marin County,

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,160
just north of San Francisco.

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,080
Oh, wonderful.

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,880
Beautiful, beautiful area.

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,120
Jennifer, I'm extremely excited

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,000
for this talk

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
because there's gonna be a lot

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,080
we're gonna have to talk about

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,960
because you have so much experience

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,360
in the realm of innovation and leadership

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,440
and balanced leadership,

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,200
which we'll get to as well,

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,960
and really the role of innovation

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,360
within organizations.

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,480
I'd love to start out with your journey

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,200
and who is Jennifer,

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,440
and how did you get

27
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,160
to where you are today?

28
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,200
So, I'm actually

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,880
a geotechnical engineer by training.

30
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,640
So, I started off

31
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,240
doing geology and chemistry,

32
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,760
but that is the essence

33
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,480
of systems thinking.

34
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,480
So, anyone out there who is a geologist

35
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,200
they know they're one of the best

36
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,800
systems thinkers on the planet

37
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,640
because we understand

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,400
the planetary nature of systems thinking.

39
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,520
And then I ended up doing work

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,520
in technology

41
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,600
because I wasn't, as a woman, wasn't allowed

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,120
to do the work I wanted to do in geology.

43
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,400
And so, I joined

44
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,680
Andersen Consulting in London

45
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,280
and that began my career in technology.

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,960
They effectively gave me the equivalent

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,200
of a computer science degree,

48
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,160
which was fantastic.

49
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,360
And I have been in technology

50
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,560
and information technology since

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,660
most recently as CIO

52
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,920
down at Stanford Research Institute

53
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,600
and now more recently

54
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,160
very, very focused on the whole

55
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,320
research and innovation space.

56
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,960
So, research and innovation space,

57
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,040
what does that even mean?

58
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,480
What does that even entail?

59
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,760
Yeah. So, what that entails

60
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,080
is working directly with people

61
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,600
who are doing robotics,

62
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,520
autonomous driving,

63
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,600
artificial intelligence, block chain,

64
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,320
all of that kind of work

65
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,800
in their research capacity.

66
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,080
So, really helping teams of people

67
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,200
do their optimal to build

68
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,920
the emerging technologies

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,400
that are gonna be super exciting

70
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,000
for the future.

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,840
And we're beginning to see

72
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,520
some of that already.

73
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,400
So, what is your expertise in that realm?

74
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:53,960
So, you mentioned

75
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,760
a bunch of different industries.

76
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,800
They're very, very different

77
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,240
from each other

78
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,600
and each require different expertise.

79
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,560
What do you see yourself

80
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,240
as the added value that you bring

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,680
when you're examining

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,520
these different companies

83
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,080
and you're working with these leaderships?

84
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,360
Yeah. So, my specific expertise

85
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,400
is in what I refer to as human innovation.

86
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,920
Human innovation.

87
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,840
... yeah. So, I ended up doing this work

88
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,280
primarily because

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,080
working in information technology,

90
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,440
I always saw that there was a huge missing

91
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,080
in people's ability to be able to do

92
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,360
really, really good design work.

93
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,400
And I don't mean product design work,

94
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
I mean how it is

95
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,280
that we actually co-invent together.

96
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,040
And one of the

97
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,240
enormously powerful capabilities

98
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,840
for innovation teams today

99
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,520
is the individual

100
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,320
and collective human being's ability

101
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,640
to be able to co-invent,

102
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,280
because as our technologies

103
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,200
become progressively more complex,

104
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,600
if we are simply working

105
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,800
in our own little silos,

106
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,120
we miss the opportunity

107
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,720
to do interdisciplinary work

108
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,360
and to do really deep innovation work.

109
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,080
So, I focused through working

110
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,920
with some of the,

111
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,920
really serendipitously,

112
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,440
working with some of the world's sort of

113
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,400
thought leaders when I was younger

114
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,880
in understanding human cognition

115
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,920
and human language

116
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,680
and how that influenced our ability

117
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,160
to be able to innovate and co-invent.

118
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,280
And I have brought that now,

119
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
through years of practice and discipline,

120
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,080
into the research and innovation space.

121
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,800
And so, I work with teams to increase

122
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,040
their innovation capacity.

123
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,080
Okay. So Jennifer,

124
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,680
I'm running a team, let's say.

125
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,960
I'm starting a company

126
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,080
and I have different silos

127
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,560
and we're working

128
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,520
on a variety of different projects.

129
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,760
What are things, as a leader,

130
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
that I can harness

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,240
in the realms of innovation?

132
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,200
How do I foster innovation

133
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,400
instead of stifle it?

134
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,080
Yeah. So, one of the things is

135
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,120
really beginning to look

136
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,520
at a different framework

137
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,640
for understanding how it is

138
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,040
that we manage and lead.

139
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,920
Traditionally, all of our management

140
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,080
and leadership paradigms and principles

141
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,440
have originated from command and control

142
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,800
where we are the leader

143
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,560
and we are supposed to be all knowing.

144
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,680
And those of us who've been

145
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,520
around long enough know

146
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,800
that that's a complete fallacy.

147
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,000
And so, it's really how do you begin

148
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,960
to enhance your capability

149
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,880
to have the brilliance of your team emerge

150
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,320
and that you become

151
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,920
a cultivator of emergence

152
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,080
rather than you become someone

153
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,080
who's telling other people what to do.

154
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,280
And so, I would end up working with you

155
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,000
to help you build yourself as that observer,

156
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,360
increase your capabilities in that space,

157
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,040
and be able to really improve the autonomy

158
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,520
and mastery of your team

159
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,080
as a result of doing ...

160
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,480
Right.

161
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,080
So, I guess the balancing question,

162
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,560
the complimentary question, to that is

163
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,680
what common pitfalls do you see

164
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,800
amongst leaders?

165
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,120
So, leaders are all around us,

166
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,720
whether they're C-level executives

167
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,240
at companies or they're tech team leaders

168
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,920
or they're teachers in a school

169
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,440
that are their own leaders in many ways.

170
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,080
What do you see are some common pitfalls

171
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,760
that people do that they're just harming

172
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,360
both themselves and the team?

173
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,840
Yeah, I think one of the saddest ones

174
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,560
is believing that you need to have

175
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,200
all the answers,

176
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,520
and a lot of leaders really think

177
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,440
that that's their role.

178
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,840
I think one of the fundamental differences

179
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,280
between leaders who amplify others

180
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,840
and who cultivates others

181
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,480
are people who are really clear

182
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,560
on what it is they know

183
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,720
and what they don't know

184
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,200
and who are open to continuous learning

185
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,680
from people all around them.

186
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,040
And I think if you look at some

187
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,160
of the more brilliant leaders today,

188
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
they will openly acknowledge

189
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,560
they hire people

190
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
who are smarter than them,

191
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,600
and they deeply listen to those people.

192
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,920
So, a lot of it is our belief

193
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,560
that we should have the answers

194
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,360
and then our belief that listening

195
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,760
is actually more about hearing

196
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,640
than it is really about attuning yourself

197
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,880
to someone else's brilliance,

198
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,360
which is kind of what you're doing

199
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,520
with this interview process, right?

200
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,720
You're tuning into what's unique

201
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,760
and brilliant about these people

202
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm talking to.

203
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
Well, I'm definitely trying.

204
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,160
And I think that one of the fun things

205
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,640
that I get to do is I get to learn

206
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,760
really interesting things

207
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,360
from every person's insight.

208
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,960
So, you've had so many years of experience

209
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,000
in this field, and I have the privilege

210
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,080
of now sitting here and interrogating you

211
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,360
to find those nuggets

212
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,240
that could be meaningful in my journey.

213
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,200
But that difference

214
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,240
between hearing and tuning in,

215
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,760
talk to me about that a little.

216
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,160
So, what we tend to do is

217
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,880
we tend to communicate with each other

218
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,720
from the perspective

219
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,080
of transferring information

220
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,000
rather than really taking the time

221
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,640
to be deeply listen, be empathetic,

222
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,000
and really understand

223
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,360
what matters to other people,

224
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,880
what other people are passionate about,

225
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,600
what they care about,

226
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,920
and how they see and interpret the world.

227
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,400
And people can be trained how to do that.

228
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,440
And in doing that, what they do is

229
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,840
they begin to build the bridges

230
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,000
and build the opportunities

231
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,920
that allow them to be able to co-invent

232
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,160
where the capabilities

233
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,480
of two people or three people

234
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,720
or four people come together

235
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,600
and produce something that neither of them

236
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,200
could produce independently

237
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,560
so that the amplifying

238
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,640
and magnifying capability of people

239
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,920
learning how to build this skill set

240
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,280
on this competency is pretty significant.

241
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,240
So, as we continue on this journey

242
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,880
of research with innovation,

243
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,480
what is left to uncover do you think?

244
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,920
Because it sounds to me

245
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,680
like the way that humans are,

246
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,000
the way ... teamwork,

247
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,440
there's been so much research done

248
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,400
on that in the past, I guess, century.

249
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,680
Is there much more to innovate

250
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,720
when it comes to human innovation?

251
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,760
I think there's tons more.

252
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,520
So, we're doing

253
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,760
a super interesting project

254
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,880
with a client at the moment

255
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,960
where we're looking at

256
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,920
how do we really deeply understand

257
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,400
the decision making process

258
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,720
of some of the lead innovators,

259
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,040
what it is that they are seeing,

260
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,520
how they're interpreting the world,

261
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,400
how they're making those decisions,

262
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,000
how much of it is based deeply

263
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
on their experience

264
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,800
and how much of it is replicable

265
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,960
by other people.

266
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,920
So, we're literally building

267
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,080
an ontology of research innovation

268
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,560
and looking at how we do that.

269
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,160
And then one of the other areas

270
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,920
that I think is one

271
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,640
of the biggest levers today,

272
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,880
which is fundamentally underserved

273
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,040
and not understood,

274
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,600
is the gender balance aspect.

275
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,960
Right. Yes.

276
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,880
Yeah, yeah.

277
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,960
We have long neglected,

278
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,440
both within ourselves

279
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,880
and across our teams,

280
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,040
the ability of human beings

281
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,120
to be able to expand

282
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,680
their repertoire of understanding

283
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,120
and interpretation of the world

284
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,880
to be able to encompass all aspects

285
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,200
of our capability for,

286
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,640
at the most coarse level,

287
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
from a masculine and feminine perspective

288
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,680
for men and women,

289
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,960
but also within the individuals

290
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,040
where we're able to expand our repertoire

291
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,960
of leadership traits and qualities

292
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,000
and also understanding.

293
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,080
And I think that as we see more women

294
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,520
enter into the emerging tech space

295
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,080
and also enter into the innovation space,

296
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,720
we're beginning now to identify

297
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,800
what are some of those

298
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,080
leadership capabilities that are unique

299
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,200
and that we want to cultivate and amplify,

300
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,360
and then also what's the impact of those

301
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,280
in terms of being able

302
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,520
to increase innovation capability

303
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,480
and accelerate our innovation ambitions.

304
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,600
Right. And actually,

305
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,040
one thing that I just loved

306
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,400
is you corrected me right before

307
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,520
we started this show

308
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,280
because when ... started talking

309
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,360
about females and male leaders

310
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
and then I was talking, yes,

311
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,760
diversity in tech is something

312
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,360
that's very common.

313
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,640
And you said,

314
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,000
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, Michael, it's not diversity.

315
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,400
It's 50 percent of the population.

316
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,480
This is balanced leadership."

317
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,280
And I just love that.

318
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,160
I'm adopting that,

319
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,120
and I'm gonna be

320
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,560
an advocate for that moving forward.

321
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,240
So, what is it about now?

322
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,720
What is happening in the space today?

323
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,040
And what do you think needs to happen

324
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,000
so that we have more balanced leadership

325
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,200
with all the positives that come with it?

326
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah, yeah. Good.

327
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,520
So, I think it is about balance

328
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,560
and not about diversity

329
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,800
because, again, it is half

330
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,840
the global population,

331
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,240
a little bit more than half actually,

332
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,120
which makes it even more interesting.

333
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,480
But I think what's missing in here is

334
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,000
we've looked at this

335
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,480
not as a business opportunity,

336
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,200
but as a social justice necessity.

337
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,760
And I think that is a huge fallacy

338
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,400
that undermined everything

339
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,720
that we're trying to do.

340
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,080
So as business leaders,

341
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,720
some of the more sophisticated,

342
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,120
advanced business leaders

343
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,800
with tremendous foresight are recognizing

344
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,080
that there is a gold mine

345
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,440
of opportunity there,

346
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,800
and if we can figure out

347
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,560
how to leverage that opportunity,

348
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,120
the leaders will obviously win,

349
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,040
they're the people

350
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,000
who are the first movers.

351
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,920
The difference that I have discovered

352
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,840
through the research that I've been doing

353
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,080
in terms of wasted opportunity is that

354
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,720
we really don't have a way

355
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,520
of talking about what it is

356
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,440
that women are doing differently

357
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,560
when they lead.

358
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,200
And there's growing awareness,

359
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,120
particularly with the pandemic,

360
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,400
because we're seeing the countries

361
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,360
that are led by women

362
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,800
have done much more successfully

363
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,520
in the pandemic.

364
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,840
Yes. Yes.

365
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,240
We're all asking ourselves why.

366
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,880
And so, I decided about 20 years ago

367
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,440
that I was really interested

368
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,520
in trying to understand

369
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,280
what women were doing differently

370
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,000
and how could you name us

371
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,280
how could you identify us,

372
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,160
how could you make it clearer

373
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,800
for other people

374
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,280
so they could understand it,

375
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,960
and then how could you move that

376
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,640
to helping people value us

377
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,520
and expand their repertoire of leadership.

378
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,680
And not just women, but women and men,

379
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,760
because some of the more brilliant men

380
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,800
that I've worked for have both male

381
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,880
and female leadership capabilities.

382
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,800
And their ability to embrace those

383
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,680
makes them better leaders.

384
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,400
And so, trying to understand

385
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,880
not only how that works for us

386
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,480
as individual human beings,

387
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,600
but how that works across teams,

388
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,200
and how we can take advantage of that

389
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,480
is something that I've been focused on

390
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,080
for a while.

391
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
And how that then impacts

392
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,720
our innovation capability.

393
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,160
And does that also translate

394
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,840
into your work with how women invest

395
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,160
as a founding LP there

396
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,680
and those sorts of initiatives?

397
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,400
Yeah. What's super interesting

398
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,600
with how women invest,

399
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,280
and I was talking to our general partner

400
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,680
the other day, and I said,

401
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,160
"Look, there's a radical difference

402
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,280
between the traditional venture capitalists,

403
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,040
who have been venture capitalists

404
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,760
in pursuit of capital

405
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,400
and distributing capital

406
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:23,880
where they think

407
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,360
they're gonna make higher returns,

408
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,840
and how women invest have built."

409
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,080
And what they've done is

410
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,240
they have produced really,

411
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,560
I refer to it now,

412
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,640
and there's growing awareness

413
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,840
that this is what it is,

414
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,960
is we're venture catalysts

415
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,440
because what we're doing is

416
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,520
we're taking money and using it

417
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,360
to change opportunities for people.

418
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,840
And not from a for benefit

419
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,120
or social justice perspective;

420
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,200
we're taking the entire

421
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,360
venture capital space and saying

422
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,240
how women invest has over

423
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,160
100 limited partners.

424
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,920
And what they're doing is that means

425
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,280
that there are a hundred women

426
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,520
who understand the venture process,

427
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,680
who are there to advise

428
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,960
and support the startups,

429
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,640
and who are having this catalytic effect

430
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,720
across the community

431
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,040
that they are in the middle of

432
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,480
which is 14,000 women across the world.

433
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,120
And so, the potential impact of that

434
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,120
from a transformation standpoint

435
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,000
is really huge.

436
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,600
So, I'm super excited about the way

437
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,040
my brilliant general partners

438
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,520
have designed their fund

439
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,160
and the potential long term impact

440
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,640
it can have across the community.

441
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,360
That's incredible.

442
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,160
But Jennifer, I have to now transition

443
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,520
a little bit to you and your passion

444
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,840
because how do you go

445
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,160
from being a vice president at Wells Fargo

446
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,840
and a senior director at Cisco

447
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,360
and chief information officer

448
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,400
and chief information and security officer

449
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,040
at the Stanford Research Institute,

450
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,280
and you go from there

451
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
to having this surge of passion

452
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,200
to cultivate innovation

453
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,160
and understand better

454
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,680
about balanced leadership.

455
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,640
What made that transition?

456
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,600
Why are you doing that?

457
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,920
So, it's not really a transition

458
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,080
because I've been doing that

459
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,440
my entire career. I've always,

460
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,000
So, I'm fundamentally lazy

461
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,640
and I always look for

462
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,200
what's the big lever.

463
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,760
And so, since the time

464
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,120
I was younger than you,

465
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,400
I went into business

466
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,440
and I went I need to find the big lever.

467
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,760
I don't want to have to work as hard

468
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,240
as these crazy people around me.

469
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,360
So, for me the biggest lever was

470
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,520
how do you re-frame ideas,

471
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,760
how do you change the way

472
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,080
people think about things,

473
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,680
and how do you bring people

474
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,440
with you because they want to come

475
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,800
not because you're telling them

476
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,520
that that's what they need to do.

477
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,280
So, my focus has always been

478
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,880
on how do you engage

479
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,360
human beings differently.

480
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,200
And that, to me, is the biggest lever;

481
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,320
if we don't understand

482
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,680
how to be able to mobilize resources

483
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,640
behind what we think is important

484
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,960
and find commonalities

485
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,200
with other humans,

486
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,040
we're always having to do

487
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,920
the heavy lifting.

488
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,960
And so, I've used this approach

489
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
that I learned in my early 20s

490
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,720
in everything that I've done,

491
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,640
and it's allowed me to be able to build

492
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,360
some incredibly powerful teams

493
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,160
because I'm focusing

494
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,600
on the emergent capabilities,

495
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,440
and that was actually the name

496
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,360
of one of my companies.

497
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,960
And then I've also used it

498
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,000
to be able to go

499
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,760
how do I help other people do that

500
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,200
so that they can build

501
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,400
more powerful teams around them

502
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,480
to be able to realize

503
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,680
some of the dreams and passions

504
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,120
that they have.

505
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,760
So, give me one or two tips

506
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,920
that I can take for myself

507
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,320
as I try to empower others

508
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,640
to want to join my team

509
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,880
or want to do things

510
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,360
because they want to,

511
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,280
not because they have to.

512
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,000
Because it sounds like

513
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,080
that's a key, key aspect of innovation

514
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,520
and part of your success

515
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,120
at all these wonderful companies

516
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,920
and corporations that you worked on.

517
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,640
Yeah. So, I think one of the things there

518
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,280
is the design element,

519
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,840
is people tend to follow people

520
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,120
who do brilliant design,

521
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,120
because people who do brilliant design

522
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,960
are looking to reduce the noise

523
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,960
in the system and increase the signal.

524
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
And what it does is

525
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,560
it creates environments where,

526
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,160
I, as someone who would be on your team,

527
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,720
can be more successful

528
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,480
just by virtue of the systems

529
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,600
that you build around you.

530
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,040
So, one of the little adages

531
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,680
I've been using

532
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,280
with some clients recently is,

533
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,800
"An hour of design is better

534
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,240
than 10 hours of delivery."

535
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,320
And so, the people who build

536
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,200
their design capacity, and design thinking

537
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,680
is obviously a fantastic tool

538
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,840
for doing that,

539
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,120
not just applied to product,

540
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,800
but applied to everything that we do,

541
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,320
is build your design capacity

542
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,440
and then recognize that what you're doing

543
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,960
in the middle of that design work

544
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,300
is you're providing frameworks

545
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,560
and constructs and opportunities for people

546
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,680
to be able to learn and grow

547
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,640
much more effectively.

548
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,680
Right. And is there some, the feedback loop

549
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,480
that you're getting from ...

550
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,080
I'm assuming that's

551
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,680
a pretty big part of it, right?

552
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,720
Because you could be thinking

553
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,480
that you're operating in a certain way

554
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,400
and that you're empowering people

555
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,200
in a certain way.

556
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,760
A lot of this is relationship driven.

557
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,480
How do you get that feedback from others?

558
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,680
Yeah. So, one of the fantastic things

559
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,600
about the design thinking work,

560
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,440
and systems thinking, is that

561
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,800
you want to be able to expose yourself

562
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,080
to as many feedback loops as possible.

563
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,680
So, when you're doing your design,

564
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,720
you're looking to immerse yourself

565
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,520
not just in feedback

566
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,080
that other human beings will give you,

567
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,040
that's super valuable,

568
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,280
but also in feedback

569
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,560
that the system itself will give you.

570
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,200
So, the focus on customer focused work,

571
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,760
the focus on customer based design work,

572
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,760
the focus on interdisciplinary teams

573
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,320
who are going to provoke your thinking

574
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,160
in different ways,

575
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,040
and how do you really create

576
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,880
an immersive experience for yourself

577
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,040
and for your teams

578
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,480
in the biggest, broadest ecosystem

579
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,600
you possibly can so that

580
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,240
you're doing this constant learning

581
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,440
and commit yourself to that.

582
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,080
And do it in a deliberate way.

583
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,920
I think a lot of people might do

584
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,720
immersive learning work,

585
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,920
but if you're not doing it

586
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,040
in a deliberate way

587
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,720
where you're looking to constantly improve

588
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,680
your learning capacity

589
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,560
and build mastery over that,

590
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,640
then you're missing out

591
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,840
on a huge opportunity.

592
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,200
So, I'm all about deliberate practice.

593
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,320
100%. 100%.

594
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,480
By the way, you mentioned earlier

595
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,960
that part of your motivation

596
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,080
for developing these processes and relationships is because

597
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,440
you saw how hard people were working

598
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,520
and you were trying to optimize

599
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,240
a lot of things.

600
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,560
And I think that it's pretty clear

601
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,360
from this conversation

602
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,800
that you're working much harder

603
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,080
than most people that I know.

604
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,200
So, thank you for the inspiration behind

605
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,160
both the optimization

606
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,680
but continuing to work so hard.

607
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,120
Jennifer, before we go, I have to ask you

608
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,200
the most important question

609
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,080
and the hardest one,

610
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,280
three words that you would use

611
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,080
to describe yourself

612
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,240
and why did you choose

613
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,480
those specific words.

614
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,480
Yeah. So, I'm a co-inventor.

615
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,840
I love doing things with other people.

616
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,200
I love seeing other people.

617
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,600
Co-inventor. I love that.

618
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Co-inventor. Yeah.

619
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,800
It's part of what I teach people to do.

620
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,760
So, I love being able to invent things

621
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,480
with other people, and I love being able

622
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,920
to see the brilliance and the beauty

623
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,840
in other people and bring that out

624
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,560
and share with them

625
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,680
and create something bigger

626
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,240
than both of us or than all of us.

627
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,080
So, that's one

628
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,800
of my favorite things to do.

629
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,200
The other thing is

630
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,920
I'm a pragmatist and an executor,

631
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,040
because at the end of the day,

632
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,920
there has to be value

633
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,600
for vast amounts of other human beings

634
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
otherwise it's more effort

635
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
than it's worth.

636
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,400
And then the other thing that I do

637
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,040
that a number of people have said to me

638
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
that I have never really

639
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,080
thought of myself as

640
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,080
but now I'm beginning to, is I name ideas.

641
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,960
So, I will see people

642
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,000
grasping for something

643
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,040
that they want to make happen

644
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,000
in the world,

645
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,360
and I work with them to define that,

646
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
to distinguish that,

647
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,600
to translate that into

648
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,480
an offer our a product or service

649
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,560
or whatever it is,

650
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,600
and really name what that is

651
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,160
not from a marketing perspective,

652
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,080
but from a development

653
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,080
and deep understanding perspective.

654
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,520
And name ideas

655
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,160
and help them bring those ideas

656
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,640
to reality. So, that's ...

657
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,560
I love it.

658
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,960
Jennifer, thank you for the inspiration.

659
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,080
Thank you for being so generous

660
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,520
with your time.

661
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,560
I know how busy you are.

662
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,800
And I can't wait to share this

663
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,280
with the world.

664
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,840
Thank you.

665
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
Thank you very much.

666
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,960
Pleasure, Michael.

667
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Take care. Bye.

668
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,600
Wonderful.
