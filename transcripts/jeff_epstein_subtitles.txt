Jeff Epstein, thank you so much for joining us at 20 Minute Leaders. It's wonderful to be here. Thank you for having me. Okay. So if I started to give a brief bio about you, I wouldn't be able to ask any questions because 20 minutes would be over. But just for context. Previous CFO of Oracle, but not just any CFO, because you've also been on the boards of the coolest companies currently on Twilio and Shutterstock. Incredible companies. But you're on the board of Booking Holdings. And you joined, you said, when it was a billion dollars in revenues growing up to 80? Billion dollars in market value, currently 80 billion. Wow. Okay. So, billion dollars in market value going up to 80 billion. But you're also on the board of Kaiser Permanente? Kaiser Permanente is a large non-profit health care organization that provides both healthcare, hospitals and health insurance for 12 million people, mostly in California, the West Coast. Unbelievable. And you mentioned 230 thousand employees. Right. Unbelievable. So, you're sitting on these boards. I'm gonna have to at some point understand how do you even juggle all of these different positions and how do you then take the skills from the CFO at Oracle and now at Apex, which hopefully we'll be able to get to as well. But Jeff, how do you do it all? It's a serious question. And I mean, when I think of who I want, like the level that I want to get to one day and have these incredible experiences, you're the persona right now. Thank you very much. Well, I spent 25 years working full time as a chief financial officer where every day you have people that report to you and you have a boss at a board and quarterly earnings. And that was a lot of responsibility. Now that I'm retired from full time work, I specially run these boards but, Retired. Okay. I just want to put the word retired in front of everything that I just said. Okay. Well, the difference between being a board member is usually you go to the board meeting, you ask a lot of questions. You say, "Boy, sounds like you've got a lot of problems." "I'll see you at next board meeting." And management of the people have to fix the problem as we just talk about them. So, there is a lot of governance responsibility, And if occasionally if you have to change the CEO or things like that. There's a lot of work. But there are certain companies like Wells Fargo. And over the last few years, they've had PG&E going through bankruptcy. They have a very intense experience. But if the company is doing well, it's a lot easier to be a board member than to the day to day responsibility of the executive. Of course. Of course. And of course, Very rewarding as well because my job is to ask questions. And so, I love learning. I love asking questions. And over the year, after 40 years, you've asked a lot of questions, you get to learn a lot. It reminds me of the nice story of when you go to the doctor and something is hurting in your knee and the doctor hits your knee and says, "Okay now, five hundred dollars, please." And you ask, "What? Do you just hit the knee?" And he said, "No, no, no. I've been studying for 40 years how to hit your knee." So, it sounds like the questions that you're asking now, they're not just any questions, they're questions with dozens of years and a wealth of experience that you bring with you. Right. Exactly. I'll give you an example of a board meeting. I've been trying to talk to some of my CEOs about this. Many of the people on this call might have actually participated in a board meeting. And in my mind, there's sort of three parts to a board meeting. There's the compliance part, the audit committee report, compensation committee, things like that, which in a private company is very short. And a public company it's there's some amount of time. And then the remainder of the time often is the management telling the board what they've been doing. Reporting on what's going on. here is our product strategy here is our sales and marketing strategy. Here's our forecast. I call that the show and tell part. And then there's another part of the meeting. The third part which is, here are decisions we're thinking about, but we haven't made them yet. And we'd like to tell you we have three choices. And here's the pros and cons of each choice. We recommend option A. We're planning on doing an option A. But what do you think? And maybe your questions and your guidance will change our mind. So, should we grow faster and burn more money, lose more money, or should we grow slower and why? Right. We have one product just in the US. Should we add a second product in the US? Or we take our first product expand to the UK. Those kinds of decisions. So, I personally find the decisions we have not yet made to be a much more valuable board meeting as opposed to the show and tell. And the show and tell, in my view, can be done in writing. Put everything in written presentation, said it out to the board a week in advance. We'll read it all. We'll ask questions if we don't understand that. But to spend most of the board time just telling us what's in the written material is to me not taking full advantage of the board. And so that's an example of the kind of thing that I've learned over the years, which 20 years ago, I probably didn't understand that. Now I try to nudge my CEOs at that direction. How would you describe your relationship with your CEOs as a board member? And you have quite a few CEOs that you have to be in touch with. Is this a friendly relationship? Is this more of a boss-employee relationship? What's the intimacy like over there? Well, it depends. If I work for the venture capital partners or private equity partners, they essentially, they are appointed by their firm or private equity firm. Maybe they hire the CEO. And the companies that I'm involved in personally, so, I'm always an independent, the CEO meets me and personally wants to recruit me to the board. So, the CEO is essentially hired me to be a board member. And essentially, the CEO can fire me if they decide they don't want me on the board. It's never happened, but they could. And so, my role is to help make the CEO as effective as he or she could be. And so, it's by asking questions, by telling stories and anecdotes. So, one way to think about it is, my dogs in the background, I love it. It just adds. It adds. So, Mark Twain said that history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. And so, if I've been involved in a company before that had a similar problem, I might tell the story. Here's what the situation was. It sounds similar. Here's what they did. Here's what happened. But that doesn't mean you should do the same thing because every situation is different. Right. And so can we stop for a minute I'm gonna see if I could get the dogs quiet. No problem. You'll have to edit that part. No worries at all. Okay? That's what's nice about this spontaneousness of this. That these things just add because it creates much more of an I think of an intimacy with my friends from Tel Aviv and Stanford, who are viewing this, because it's not edited and there is no agenda to make it look perfect. It's as if we're having coffee and we're just sharing with them our coffee. Okay. Right. So, you were telling me about Mark Twain. Yeah. So, Mark Twain said history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. And so my interpretation of that is if I'm at a board meeting and something comes up with the company and there's a challenge or a problem, I'll say, well, in two or three other situations, I had a similar type of situation. Here's what the situation was. Here's what the company did. It worked or didn't work. That doesn't mean that you, the CEO, should do the same thing because your situation is going to be somewhat different. But if you never had any similar experience, you're flying blind. Whereas if you have the benefit of mine or other people's experience, you can triangulate and piece together the pieces of the puzzle and say, "Well, I think this is relevant." And then you make up your own life. So, I basically work as a board member, not by telling people what to do, but by asking questions and by telling stories. I think that's incredible. And I haven't gotten to that position and I very much hope to one day be able to be a CEO where you're on the board of. So, wait for that request one day. But it sounds to me that a lot of these things you can look up online and read case studies from business schools and understand that how you get to point B from point A. But it sounds like a lot of the added benefit that you would bring to the table is not just A and then B, but it's the whole process and the relationships and the intricacies then and the complexity that goes into it. So, you know all the details of the whole process and not just the outcome, right? Yeah, it's not only the details, it's also the emotional impact of having lived through it. Right. So, you've probably heard the phrase, raise money when you can, not when you need it. And if you hear that, you say, "Okay, well, that makes sense." "That's logical." But I've actually lived through it. And I'll tell you that story. I was the CFO of DoubleClick during the Internet boom. And our stock went from, we went public at $250 million at market value, and we were up to $11 billion. So, we were trading at 22 times revenue, a huge price. We're still losing money. We're growing fast. And we're the leading Internet advertising technology company. But by any measure, the company was fully valued. I mean, we clearly weren't undervalued. And so we decided to raise money. We did a follow-on offering and we were in the market raising $700 million. A public company. And we had a roadshow. We started Monday morning. We had a price Thursday night. And on Wednesday at lunch, I'm presenting to investors at a luncheon meeting and I got a call from my office, the message said, "Call NASDAQ". So, I call on NASDAQ and they say, "You know, we have a problem." And I go, "Really? What's the problem?" He said, "Well, we have a lot of sell orders." And I said, "Really? How many?" And he said, "Well, we have so many sell orders and no buying interests that we're stopping trading in your stock." And so, for the rest of that Wednesday afternoon, are stock and trade. And what had happened was there was an article in USA Today that morning about how DoubleClick was violating people's privacy. And that just spooked investors. They didn't want to think about it. So, we sit with our investment bankers Wednesday night and we say "What's going to happen?" And they predict accurately that the stock's going to open up tomorrow morning, down 20%. So, a nine billion dollar valuation. And the question is, should we just pull the offering or should we go ahead with the offering at the 20% lower valuation? And my feeling was the price that it was yesterday is irrelevant. The question is, is nine billion a fair price? Yes or no. And for a company with 500 million revenue losing money, I thought that was still a very good valuation. And even though we had 200 million cash, we didn't need the money. I thought it was just a sensible thing to raise money when you can. So, I recommended and then we went ahead and raised money. And then of course, the whole market, the Internet market collapsed as the advertising market collapsed. Our revenue over the next two years dropped by 50% from 500 million to 250 million. But we had 700 million cash. So, we had a very strong balance sheet. So, it's one thing to say, it is nothing to live through it. That's unbelievable. So, and we all have, if you're old enough, you all have stories like that. That's just unbelievable. And of course, that throughout this whole thing, I gently forgot to mention that that you are teaching one of the most popular courses at Stanford, which I very much hope to take myself one day, hopefully this coming winter. And you're also an operating partner at Bessemer. One of the world's leading venture capital firm. What do you do there? What does that even mean, an operational partner? We'll talk about that. But I do want to talk about the class, too. Yes, An operating partner means I'm not an investing partner. So I don't make any decisions to invest customers money. I can invest my own money, side by side with Bessemer. And since I was a career CFO what I've done is I've created a CFO advisory board among Bessemer's portfolio companies' CFOs. So, we have 100 portfolio company CFOs And any company, there might be 100 or 200, 300 employees, that CFO probably has no one else in the company to talk to about a finance related issue. Right. But it was in the portfolio, it was one hundred people to talk to. Pre-covid times we meet in person once a quarter. Now we're meeting online. We have an online platform where people are asking each other questions couple times a week. There's a big database of questions of the last seven years. So, it's a very rich valuable resource of a peer group among our portfolio companies. And so, I do that at the CFOs. And then the CEOs help them in business or finance or capital raising questions or operational questions as well. Wow. Incredible. About the class, what a Lean Launchpad class is, It's in the winter quarter. It's Engineering 245 in the Graduate School of Engineering. But business students typically are half the class. And it's teams of four or five students with a startup idea. And in 10 weeks they're required to interview 100 potential customers. Wow. Build multiple prototypes, have run many experiments, and with any luck, they generate the first revenue by the tenth week. And we've had now, I guess this would be my eighth year teaching. So, we've had quite a good 100 teams or so, are graduate from the class. And we've had maybe 15 teams actually form companies and get funding and some of them are doing quite well. Wow. That's a huge. revenues And some very exciting companies. One of them is fresh technologies, which is AI for grocery ordering. One is Zoom Which is Uber for children or for schools type of system. One of them is Novo, which is financial. It's getting credit for legal immigrants who might otherwise find it hard to get credit. So, a lot of really interesting ideas and it's terrific. I just love working with these incredibly talented students. And it's a great experience for the students to get as close to running a business. Without dropping out. So, that's what Lean Launchpad class. I just get inspired by you. Again, the first few minutes, you mentioned that you're retired. And I think it's just speaks to your passion, to everything that you're doing, that  you're considering yourself retired, yet you do more than people doing a lifetime. To me, I mean, that's really the inspiration. You know all the tips and tricks that are amazing. Very insightful. But the fact that at the end I get to speak to somebody who's calling themselves retired and yet they're doing extraordinary things. I mean, almost everything that you're doing here is a world class level that any amazing entrepreneur would wish they could do. And to me, that's inspiring. And that's definitely one of my goals in life, to be able to say that I'm retired yet work as much as you do. Jeff, I have to ask, CFO, Oracle, everybody knows Oracle and the incredible things that this company has done. You've seen it also earlier on. What does even the CFO do? I don't get to speak to many CFOs in my daily life. Well, of course, the CFO at any size company does is responsible, the same functions, accounting, treasury risks, capital raising, financial planning and forecasting. The difference is that when I was the CFO of DoubleClick years ago, I started out we had 180 people and I probably did 25% of the work myself. I would run the Excel models myself. I would do the investor presentation myself. And I delegate 75% of the time. You know, you start off in your career, you do 100% yourself. You've no one to delegate to. Right. I was a manager. I had a team. Initially I had a team of maybe 10 people that grew to probably at the peak there. I would say maybe a 100 people in finance out of two thousand, typically 5% of the head counts in finance. But at Oracle, I did virtually zero percent personally and delegated 100%. So, if I had written the investor relations presentation myself, the head of investor relations would have said, "You know what am I doing." So, even if I have ideas about investor relations, the best way to do is to sit down. The head of investor relations say, "You know, here are some ideas, but, you know, you go off and do it and then I'll give you some guidance." But fundamentally, it's a leadership role as opposed to, and it's a decision making role as opposed to doing all sorts of changes quite a bit. Oracle is an incredibly well-run organization. And has been for decades. And 40% profit margins. [--] [--] And how do you go through that transition? I mean, yourself going and having to see a company through its early stages to its more advanced stages. How do you even get yourself to understand because it's different orders of magnitude for the problems, right? We're back. Wonderful. I might have, it's my internet connections. No worries. What I was asking, though, which was I think it's very interesting. I mean, you've grown as a CFO from early stage startups, in terms of annual revenues all the way up to the billions. It can't be the same mindset and the same day to day responsibilities and thinking. You have to be transitioning yourself. What is that like transitioning from millions to billions? Well, I did it over 25 years. It wasn't overnight. Still sounds very fast. There is a big difference. And between DoubleClick and Oracle, I was the CFO of a big group at Nielsen, the television ratings and Internet ratings company. So, they were a global company with many thousand employees. So, I had that exposure to large companies. One difference that Larry Ellison, years ago, the founder and chairman of Oracle, Oracle started with a country structure, grew very fast in the early days, and they had Oracle US, Oracle UK, Oracle Japan. And one day around, that's a 20 years ago, he said, "We are a big company now." "But we're operating like seventy five small companies." And what we should do is centralize and to take advantage of economies scale. And so, over the course about two years, they went from 75 different countries structure to one global structure. So, each country had its own CEO and its own CFO. And then when it went all over, there was no other CEOs, no other CFOs. I was the only person in Oracle with the title of CFO, Global and Global Controller, one head of marketing. Things like that. And there are tradeoffs. It can be centralized or decentralized. But Oracle was an example of an extreme case of very effective and efficient centralization. In contrast, Booking Holdings grew through acquisition and we on booking.com, Priceline, Kayak, Open Table, Lab and other companies and each of those businesses had its own, not only its own CEO and CFO, but had its own complete business with almost no shared resources. And it also ran extremely well as a very decentralized entrepreneurial organization. So there's no right answer. But I think whichever strategy you have you want to execute it well. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Jeff, I can't believe our time is almost up. It's so sad every time. You know, give me one or two earned secrets, true earned secrets that you would give me a young entrepreneur, just starting my journey hopefully going to try to make an impact and a dent on the world in a positive way. What are really extraordinary things that I should be keeping in mind over the next decade as I pursue this dream? Well, two ways, for entrepreneurs, if you're starting a company from scratch, What we teach in this class is the first step is to get the product market fit. And so, if you wanted my advice for most companies, software companies, is to try to create the smallest possible product with the smallest ever customers who love you a lot. and program [--] puts it this way. So, you'd rather have 10 customers who love you, than a million customers who like you. Yeah, and the logic is, if you've created a product let's say customers love, a pretty company, you could find an 11th minute quite at 12. But if you have a lot of customers who just like, tomorrow, they're gonna go on like something else. Right. So you want to start a small. If you think about Facebook started just hit harder. And within two weeks, he had 90% of all Harvard students loving Facebook. And Airbnb started with literally renting an airbed someone's apartment. So they started with a very small product, few and a very small number customers, but they built huge companies. And so, I think you can't build a jet engine company that way. But for many businesses, you can. That's on the entrepreneur side. If you're an employee, my favorite sort of tactic is if when you're interviewing for a job, you have a boss and ask your boss, tell your boss that, say, "Listen, let's pretend you hire me." "Let's imagine you hire me." "And a year from now you're sitting giving me my performance review." And you say, "Boy, I made a great decision Jeff, hiring you, for the following three." "Because you've accomplished the following three things." What are those three things? What it does is it forces your hiring manager to crystallize what his or her expectations are of you. And then if you know exactly what the expectations are, then you can exceed them. Can I reverse that and use that as the hiring manager, as a tactic to really align expectations properly and sort of give my ideal performance review ahead of time and then have them try to match it throughout the year? Yeah, I think that's a great a second application, I love it. When you start a new job and you haven't already had that conversation with your boss the first week in your job, because a good leader will do that anyway. But many managers and leaders aren't experienced and just don't know that tactic. And then you can go for a long time thinking you're doing what you should be doing and realizing that you're not necessarily focused on the top. I imagine that grows in a few orders of magnitude in tech when a lot of leaders are not necessarily leaders, but they are more tech experts who've grown to be team leaders organically through their organization. Yeah, a similar example, I focus only on three things, but an even more powerful technique is to focus on one thing. So I sat at a dinner party once next to George Roberts of KKR, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and we were talking about the problems of education America. He said, "You know, Jeff, if you could do one thing to improve education of America, what would be?" I thought a lot about education. but I actually never thought of that. If I look only only one thing, what's the one most important thing? And I realize that's actually the best question to ask many people in many circumstances. Whatever your basement situation, just say, "If you could do one thing, what's the one most important thing you could do?" It's incredibly powerful. I love it. I just love it. Jeff, before we leave, I have to ask you a question that I ask every person on the show, and I'm especially curious to hear your answer. I'd love to hear three words that you would use to describe yourself, or if I were to ask any of the CEOs that you've worked with, whether they're in Shutterstock or Booking or Kaiser, what would they think of when they think of Jeff Epstein? Curious. Analytical. Helpful. I love it. Jeff, thank you so much for the inspiration. Thank you for the time. I can't even imagine how you're juggling everything that you're doing yet you're still giving me these 20 minutes. And so thank you for your generosity. I'll add that is the fourth word. Stay safe and stay healthy. Michael, thank you very much. I'll see you in class in the winter. Well, I'm sorry to say, you actually have to apply to the class and get accepted. Now, a new application. I'm just putting in the hint. But I'll definitely apply. Sounds good. I'm planting the seeds. Okay. Take care. Bye bye. Bye.
