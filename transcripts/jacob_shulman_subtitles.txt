Jacob Shulman, thank you for being on 20 Minute Leaders. Hi Michael, very nice being here. I am so excited to learn about what it means to be the CFO of multiple companies, very very well-known companies. Mellanox, JFrog most recently, an incredible company here in Silicon Valley. And I'm especially curious to hear and to learn as a young entrepreneur, what are the responsibilities and the different mindsets that one needs to come with when working as the chief financial officer. Because I don't know finances. I don't know what that even entails. You raised over $750 million in capital. You've managed or, and you've seen over $1.5 billion in acquisitions. I mean, these are just astonishing numbers. Jacob, let's just start. Who are you? I don't know. Looks like I'm a simple guy that trying to achieve my dream career and enjoy all the way through it. So, what is that dream career that you're talking about? I always wanted to be involved in business and I work along very bright entrepreneurs, helping them to achieve their goals. My background is in finance. And I enjoy that side of the business. As you know, entrepreneurs many time they, technology is they're very bright guys. But they less, let's say, knowledgeable in finance and scalability. How to run the businesses, and back offices of corporations. Right. I mean, when I think about entrepreneurs, I think of these crazy people who run up and down the hallway screaming about the strategy and what we should be doing. But they're not necessarily connected to the financial spreadsheets that it takes to then run a successful business that can raise capital through the rounds. It's not just financial spreadsheets. It's the back office, right? How to build a scalable processes. How to consider different decisions. Will it make sense to raise capital now? Or maybe, wait until the product is ready and raise later? [--] All of this decision, I'm helping them to take. So, yeah. Because I think that one of the interesting phenomena that I'm observing is that the millions of dollars that people are talking about in venture funding, it's almost become like just meaningless numbers. Like yeah, I raised six million. Oh, maybe I could raise 10 million. And you're talking about the different finances of a company, and it almost seems to lose the meaning of what is that money actually being used for. So, it sounds like, is your position really understanding the core of the company, and understanding how much money we actually need, and how are we actually going to use it? Yes, absolutely. So first of all, what's our needs, right? Right. What the runway we want to get. But also, what our core business, and what value we could get for that business, right? Yes. Many times its valuation is very subjective. But at the end, there are some substantial business behind that, all right? So, how do you combine these to your needs, your valuation, and what's to business behind them? This is something that makes sense. So, you give me the day to day of a CFO. I'm observing. I talk to a lot of founders and entrepreneurs, and I see how they operate. But I've never really shadowed a CFO of a huge company, like Mellanox or JFrogs. Share with me. You come to the office in the morning, what do you care about? What keeps you up at night? First of all, when I wake up, first thing is, to check how the futures of the market looking at. To see what's gonna happen today in the market. And especially if you see offer of public company. Many times a company shares move, irrespective of the company business. Different drivers behind the share price. But at the end, every employee of public company, when they come to work, they open the hour finance, and they see, "Okay, oh, what's going on with the company?" And the company's shares down five percent, below five percent. Is that a big thing? When you're an executive in a public company that you go and you are constantly checking, Yahoo Finance to see what the stock price is? Not constantly checking. But you do want to have an idea what's going on today in the market. Because many times investors might call if it's significant movement in the stock, right? So, if the stock, what's a significant movement, for example? I'd say more than five percent. People would like to understand why. What's the reasons for that, right? And especially, if you have a very good relationship with investors, they might call you and ask, "Hey, what's going on with the company?" Right? What is it that triggering? What are the trigger in this movement? Interesting. So, you could come to the office and you see like there's a five percent increase or decrease. And you just get a phone call and say, "Hey, I thought we just lost a few billion dollars here." "Can you explain, like, is there anything wrong?" Yeah. So, many times, yeah. Different investors, they look at the time horizon. Time horizon is different. Some guys, they don't really, they don't care about daily movements because they invest for the long term. And some guys, they have much shorter view. So, this is obviously the way how you choose investors in your business. Who you contact to. What investor to target. That's very important. So, Jacob, what is your biggest contribution to the company? So, as the CFO, what is the top three things that you provide, that without you the company would not be able to continue as it's doing today? So, first of all, I think my primary role is to help the CEO of the company to understand where we stand with our financials, what's the true performance of our business. And what investments, additional investments we can allow ourselves to make to grow the business. And what are those areas where we could invest to help, to get the best ROI. That's I think, the primary role. Because, as you know, CEOs, they're very busy people. They drive the product, they drive marketing. They try to close deals. And many times they don't have time and capacity to have that view. So, that's what my primary role. Second, I obviously help a lot with running the back office of the company. The company on your own. The company, a lot of law that you have to comply with. There is different regulations, etc. This is something that I help with as well, because I want the business side, the CEO to focus on the business. Right. Those are my main areas. And obviously being the contact in major stakeholders. Such as investors, and all that stuff. So, that's the governance side of the company. And this is something also that I'm helping with. How connected are you to the mission of the company? So, how connected are you to the mission of Mellanox? The mission of JFrog? Rather than the financial projections of where the company could get to? And I'm talking, when I say mission, I'm talking about, Google's mission is to connect to the world's information, like those types of missions. Are you there with the executive teams? Of course. Of course. This is, as executive in the company, you have to believe in the mission company. You have to, otherwise, there's no place for you in the company. If you don't believe in the mission, you're a leader in the company. Right. Not just you account the seeds and calculates income and expenses. No, not at all. You do a leader in the company, you drive the company forward. If you don't believe in the mission, or far away from understanding the mission, then there's no way for you you have to be in the company. Totally. Totally. Okay. So, talk to me a little bit why you enjoy being the CFO? I am a numbers guy. But I'm not a huge economics guy. I am much more, I think, in the realm of, the engineering side of things. Why CFO? Why leading the financials of the companies. First of all, I think my background fits me very well for this position. But this is something that I always was attracted to. The financial side, right? The investment side, the ROI. Unless, maybe creative on the engineering side. Although I do have some engineering background. But, with the time I develop these capabilities of truly understanding the financial future of the company. For me just to take a look at the financials, I know what's going on right away. Right? So, this is something that I enjoy. And this is something that I feel comfortable with to live that side of the business. Are those similar lessons and understandings as what investors need in order to invest Series B onwards, as you're able to actually look at the details of the numbers? Obviously investors in public companies and VC investors, the're completely different considerations that they make. When the public company investors reduce the financials, they typically could value the company on certain history of the company performance, right? Financial performance. They see investors. They many times, they don't even have any history of the company. These investors, they many time just invest into the idea, and into the entrepreneur, versus the public investors where they typically invest into the business. Already established business. Comparing how they performed. Comparing their success in the market and then projecting what will be their future success. That makes a lot of sense. And, I still wanna know the, you're seeing the companies grow, what is the most fun thing you take away from seeing these companies grow? Is it more of the early stages, the later stages? Because most of your experiences, in the later stages, right? I joined Mellanox when they were just $50 million in revenues. Wow. And I saw this growth. When I left Mellanox, they were over a billion dollars in revenue, and a 3,000 employes. So, obviously, I saw that growth. And it's obviously with different stages, you have to deal with different issues. Right? When it's smaller company, less established company, you really try to penetrate into the market. To build those processes that allow to scale fast if you're successful. With a large company, you deal with a lot with management of the company. Coordination. Maybe acquiring other companies, integrating them into the business. It's a different stages, you have different needs. So, and as you're going through these different companies and different incredible experiences, what are some of the patterns that you're seeing in terms of, healthy ways of running finances? There maybe unhealthy ways of doing that. I mean, things that I could take with me as an entrepreneur moving forward, when I run my own business. What are the most critical things I should keep in mind besides bringing on a very very good CFO? Critical things is, first of all, it's all about people, right? People you work with, the integrity of your CEO. I would never want to work with someone who does shady deals or anything like that. So, integrity is a big part of it. It's honesty and integrity. That's very important. Because we all come to work to enjoy. And I don't want to have sleepless nights just thinking what might happen, right? If my partners decide, "Hey, maybe we'll do cut that corner or that one." No. No. No. So, this is all about people first. And second, obviously, truly, I enjoy working with true professionals, right? They're passionate about the business. Totally. As a CEO or as an entrepreneur, the CFO, will the same person usually fit the role as the company grows? Because I imagine that you probably would get a CFO, I guess, when you're, I don't know, Series B, maybe, in the company? And then you're growing and eventually you're gonna go public, hopefully. And you're gonna have perhaps, a billion dollars in revenue. That's a very different transactional amount from raising $30 million to getting now, to getting a $100 million a year. Is it usually the same person who can handle both? Or do you usually see people shifting, changing CFOs? It depends on the person. Many people just enjoy working with smaller companies. And when the company reaches a certain level, then they just decide to leave and go back to smaller companies. Same true for other guys who enjoy working for big companies. There are some people like me who enjoyed to see all the way through grow, right? And many times you're just grow with the company and you use a lot of common sense. Totally. Totally. Talk to me a little bit about this idea of seeing big growth as a strategy versus getting bubbled up in the current finances. So, you're looking at financial statements in the back office and what's happening. But you also have to imagine what's possible for the company to achieve one day. So, how do you balance the two? And what are the ways that you are able to then think about the big picture? Yeah. So, obviously, you have to analyze the size of your market. and potentially your competition, what they could take. So, a lot of "what if" scenarios that you build in, a lot of different projections that you're trying to build and see, hey, what makes sense? How big could it be. And what makes sense to invest today to get there. Right. Versus maybe, just milking the existing market. But that's something that's changing all the time, right? I mean, looking at your market and your competition. On a strategic level, yeah, you have to do that every so often, right? Typically on the strategic side, things don't change every day, right? But you definitely have to go through this exercise every so often to see. Because different markets change at different ways, right? If you're in a very very fast changing market, then you have to do that much faster versus maybe established markets with not many players, then maybe you don't have to do that at all. Yeah. Is it a very scary job what you're doing? I mean, managing. Because at the end, it sounds to me, you are the backbone of the company. Always, the company can look at you and say, "Jacob, are we good? Are we good?" "Yeah, we're good. We're good." And you're the one that's keen on all the numbers. You know what's gonna happen in a month. You're projecting what's gonna happen in year. It sounds like a lot of responsibility, honestly. I'm still learning how to manage my own finances properly. You're managing billions of dollars. So, is it scary sometimes? No, it's not. Obviously, I have to be properly prepared for that. Right. And it all comes with experiences. Obviously, now, today, I feel much more comfortable in my job versus my first CFO job, when I got when I was 32, right? That was a bit scary. What was that like? What is it? What was that like getting your first CFO at 32 and for the first time running the company? You have huge weight on your shoulders. And that weighs on you, right? And to make decisions, knowing that you are the last one who made a decision, and the business will perform based on your decision, that's something that you have to get used to. How did that turned out at the end? That was very successful. You know that my first CFO job, I joined the company that was going through some sort of restructuring. And, it was at the end a very successful restructuring. The company turned profitable. And it was very good exercise for me to understand, get my hands there in different things. Incredible. So, you've seen growth at Mellanox from 50 million a year to, you say, a billion a year. JFrog also, fast fast fast growing company. Is that really where your excitement is in the fast growing companies? Oh, yeah, of course. You want to come to the office and deal with different things, right? Every day. And I'm not the person who wait in to do the routine stuff everyday. So, the company that grow and present those opportunities, and that's what excite me. So, if you have to give some financial advice, and obviously you're not supposed to give financial advice informally, but if you were to give financial advice strategically to young entrepreneurs that are starting their businesses, or even entrepreneurs who have now raised their series A and are moving forward, what are the most important things that the CEO should keep in mind, given your knowledge of the CFO position? Yeah. Always be frugal. Frugal. Okay. Don't throw away money when you don't need to. Because markets are volatile, Our economic environment is very unstable. So, just cash as a [--]. I don't say don't invest, but know where you invest. What's your expectation from that investment. And just don't throw money. Right. I mean, when you deal with these sums of money, how granular does a company get? I mean, when you're talking about a $100 million deal, I always thought to myself, I remember I even asked a friend when I was younger, you buy a house for, let's say, $500 thousand. What if you could just ask, if you were to go to that dealer and say, "Hey, can you give me a $500 discount on the house?" They would say, "Yes.", right? Nobody would cancel the deal. Yet, in our day to day lives, we think a lot before we spend $500. So, in the same realm, I'm thinking, when you have a $100 million deal and you've seen those deals, how granular do people get about the millions? Or is it just like, okay, let's just round it up to the next nicest number and make everybody happy? I think with any deal, it all depends on the materiality, right? Okay. Deal of $500, $100 is a material to that deal. Right. But in deal $500 million dollars, $100 is nothing, right? So, really, when you focus on material things and not just bank, is that what helps you to think strategically. On the other hand, my accounting department, when they reconstruct bank accounts, they have to go to [--], right? And this is what I expect from them. Sure. No, that make sense. It really depends on the role. And depends on the materiality of deal. I'm sure. I'm sure. Jacob, before we leave, I have to ask you the most important question. Three words that you would use to describe yourself. Future. Future. Because future, I always think, trying to think several years ahead. That's something that guides me. And that's why future, different people living different time, right? Some people live in present. Yeah. I'm always thinking about future, present is less concern me. What I always think few steps ahead. Amazing. That's what it is. I think, the second would be Fun. Because we spend so much time at work. And I'd like to do what I like to do and to have fun with that, right? And third, I don't know, maybe different experiences. Because other than work, you have your life going on, right? You want to enjoy the life as well. Work is a very important component of my life. But I have various interest other than work. I love it. I did not expect those three words from really really accomplished CFO. But I always love being surprised. But, Jacob, thank you very much for the time. Thank you for your inspiration and for teaching me. We didn't even talked about J-Ventures, and early stage investing. But we'll leave that for another time. But thank you very much. Thank you, Michael, very much for having me. Take care. Bye bye. Bye bye.
