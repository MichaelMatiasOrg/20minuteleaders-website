1 Denise Brosseau, thank you so much for being on my show. How are you? I'm very well, Michael. Nice to talk with you. I'm so excited to hear about your journey in the different organizations that you are a part of a group. We're not going to be able to talk about everything that you've done, even though I want to talk about everything, because it's so so cool. Besides the fact that you're a lecturer at Stanford Business School and you were honored as a Champion for Change by the White House. And you were, I think, named one of 100 most influential women in Silicon Valley as well. So, a lot to talk about, definitely. But before we dive into two specific wonderful organizations that you were a part of, Futuro Health and Vote by Design, both related to Stanford, I'd love to hear a little bit about yourself. And you mentioned to me that you've started your first company at the age of 26. And I'd love to understand a little bit about your life journey and what led you to do all the awesome things that you do. By the way, one of the most awesome things that I found was that you are on the board of a local theatre company right in the Bay Area, which won the Tony Award. It did. And it's been such a pleasure. You never think I've been a huge theatergoer my whole life. And to get invited to serve on this board was such a dream. And then, literally right after I joined, they won the Tony. And so, I'll take credit. Are you more interested in plays or musicals for theater? It's both, which I love. It's three musicals every year and four standard plays. And so, it's the best of all possible worlds. All right. So, I have to know that your favorite musical? Oh, my goodness. That's not a fair question. It's like choosing between a mother and a father. A musical you love? If I will go back to my earliest days, I think the first musical I ever fell in love with was The Sound of Music. And just recently, I went back and watch the movie. I had not seen it in decades. And so, what a pleasure to realize that musical really stands up over time. 100%. It's timeless. Okay. So, going back to your journey. You're starting a company at the age of 26, walk me through some of your path. Well, I started my career really very eclectic. I had no idea what I want to be when I grow up. But I moved out to California after coming out here on a business trip and stumbled my way into the tech industry. And my first company went under quickly after I had joined it. And while I was there, I fell in love with this Macintosh computer. And so, I ended up going into another consumer software company, which I loved, but on the side, I started this Macintosh consulting business and started helping install computers and train people on computers and ended up making more money in my little side business than I did in my day business. Which was fine because it was really where my heart was. And it was actually that experience that really pushed me to go to business school. To go back to Stanford and get my MBA. Because I was thinking, I love this little company, but I don't know how to scale it. I just had no real understanding of what it took to do that next step. And so, when I went back to get my MBA, it was with that entrepreneurship goal, but also, I did a focus in non-profits. And so, coming out of Stanford, I went back into the tech industry, but on the side I started a nonprofit organization with a bunch of friends. And it was really the culmination of both of those loves, which was an organization called the Forum for Women Entrepreneurs, a non-profit, and it was all about women in venture capital, how could I help others who were going through what I was going through to really scale. How do you do that, how do you raise venture capital, why would you want to, why would you not want to. And then, so, we built this community and I grew it to seven cities across the country. And I helped start the first venture capital conference for women entrepreneurs, Springboard, that is helped now women raise over nine billion in capital. That was that really joyous journey of women's entrepreneurship. It had its downside, there was economic downturns and struggles. But then after that, I did a little other eclectic things, did some politics, and then I started in really the journey that I'm in now, which is how do I help people make the journey from leader to thought leader. You actually taught a course, right? At Stanford Business School, about that. Yeah. That's really my passion right now is how do I help people, primarily women, but everybody, really think through like what is it take to be a thought leader; why do you need to think about this; why does this matter. And so, I wrote a book on the subject. I do a lot of consulting and coaching and teaching both at Stanford and on Lincoln Learning. And that's really the work I do today. So, talk to me a little bit about this jump between a leader and a thought leader. What is that all about? Well, it's a wonderful question. Because I think it's been such an overused word. And part of what I've been trying to do in working in this field is to recapture what I think is the essential elements. So, for me, leader is someone who is really what I call, "one too many". They usually have control over the people that they're interacting with, that they're managing, they're leading because they are in some ways connected to these folks, either through a direct relationship or somewhat a matrix organization. But when you think about thought leadership, I think about, that is many to many, how do you get people to take the ideas that you're advocating and carry them forward to their communities. So, it's really thinking about this ripple effect and how do we build change, how do we build essential movements, and that is really this construct of being a thought leader. So, it's a really different set of skills. I mean, it's certainly the essential elements of leaders, but then it adds a whole set of skills of mostly communication skills about how do you really move beyond that to become a thought leader. So, for anybody watching this, that we don't have the privilege of being in that class and going through that journey with you, give me some of the insights that the students taking that course at Stanford would get about understanding how to have this one to many relationship as a leader. I think it begins with really understanding that you can't do this in every field. You have to really double down and find one particular niche that's really yours. Someplace that you can own and that you have some passion around. So, it's not even just about expertise, it is about having some driving passion around making some change. So, I talk a lot about this, what if future. So, when I was starting the forum for Women Entrepreneurs, my what if future was, what if women could have 50% of the venture capital funding in the United States? At the time, it was less than one percent when we began, and sadly, not a whole lot has changed. I think in a good year we might get to four percent or seven percent, maybe. Really? Yeah. No, it's been years. We have made very little progress. And so, your what if future can be far far away, it can be something you're striving to. But the other thing to understand, I think the big differentiator between leaders and thought leaders is this idea of being clear in developing frameworks and blueprints and things that others can pick up and carry forward. It's not enough for you to have a really cool meme on just a message that people can carry forward, although I'm not saying that's not good, that's a great, essential element. But really, having the guideposts for others who are going to carry your ideas to their communities, they need to have the message, the book, the blueprint in some way. And so, I think that was a key differentiator that I was trying to teach my students, like, what is it take to make change. And when you learn something, how can you share that with others. I love it. Okay. And then you get honored by the White House. Was that for a specific project or did you go to the White House for that? I did. It was quite an amazing experience. It was under Obama, which was a wonderful time to be in the White House. And I was honored for my work with women's entrepreneurship. Whether it was through Springboard or Forum for Women Entrepreneurs. And I was nominated and selected and we went. There was a hundred people who were all honored at the same time. And we were honored from across the United States. And what was so magical about that day, besides never imagined you're going to get honored at the White House, okay, let's start with that. But then, it was a whole day. So, after the ceremony, then they actually broke us up into working groups and we had a chance to sit down with people from different networks of women and from Florida and Tennessee. And I learned so much from what these people were doing. And I was able to share some of the things that I had also been working on. And so, that was I think that was the hugest gift. Wow. That's incredible. Okay. So, let's dive into two wonderful organizations, both of them with making a great impact. Let's start with Futuro Health and then move on to Vote by Design, which is obviously very very relevant to the times we live in today. So, the Futuro Health, talk to me a little bit about that. Most recently, you were the chief operating officer of that organization. What was the aim over there? So, what was great about Futuro Health is it's a very unique design in the way it came together. So, it was brought about by a partnership between Kaiser Permanente and their largest union, SEIU-UHW. And these two organizations came together and funded this non-profit Futuro Health with $132,000,000 over the next four years. And the focus is how do we build the next network as it were the next workforce in education, excuse me, the next workforce in health care. And so, what we're doing is where the union is out there picking up connections through the community of all the members that they have, they've 100,000 members. So, they're outreaching to friends and family and inviting them to come and go back to school to become health care workers. And then Kaiser money is then spent to actually support these adult learners to go back to become medical assistants, dental assistants, etc. Because in California, we are looking at a shortage even before covid, it was looking to be 500,000 person shortage in health care by 2025. What? I know. And that kind of scary because I want to grow old here. I want someone to be ready to take care of me when I'm older. So, this is really, and what's unique about it not just, of course, the special enormous initiative. But it's so unusual for a big organization and a union to come together. That is very rare. But secondly, understanding that it is very hard for an individual, especially a low income individual to go back to school, it's a year out of your life, it's expensive. To have an organization who not only is going to pay for it, but also going to offer you support to that journey, that's the really critical element. Because we really want to build our workforce, but we can't depend on them to be able to pay for their own education, we need to fund them. And so, this I think, is a model that we'd love to see replicated across the whole United States. Wow. So, give me a little bit of insight into the actual experience of being the operating officer over there. What was one of the greatest challenges you faced in some of the interesting occurrences you had? Well, the funny thing was I was working with a woman that I actually knew through the Stanford community, she's also a Stanford MBA. She's a couple of years behind me and she also has her masters in education. And she was actually headhunted by this group to start and to be the CEO, and she called me. I was the first person that she brought on board week one and we got together. I was really the person putting in all the infrastructure. So, while she was doing a lot of managing of the unbelievable amount of politics that were involved, I was really putting in all the getting the bank account; figuring out who was going to do the accounting for us, all of that; and then hiring the team; and finding a location up in Sacramento where we were all located; and then, of course, all the basics of putting in the financials; putting in all of the systems processes. So, I learned a ton. I haven't actually  been an employee for a long time, so I thought, my moment was always a consultant. So, this was unique for me. But I really believe in the mission of the organization and I just love everything that we were doing. So, I did a whole year of commitment to this and I just left about two weeks ago. So, I'm proud of what the organization is on its solid footing now, and I do feel like they're on their way, and I really love that startup phase. I'm not the person who likes to be there to scale. I really like the foundations and getting everything done. Unbelievable. Okay. And then, you work on Vote by Design, working with the design school at Stanford, which is notorious for coming up with innovative solutions to all sorts of problems. So, what is this project? So, Lisa Kay Solomon, my client, is the founder of Vote by Design. And she came together, she's an executive in residence over at the Design school, and she brought together a group of folks, whether they were design thinking folks, neuro-scientists, educators, they came together about a year ago to rethink how individuals can be empowered to have more agency around voting. How could you create a civic engagement experience for voters and would be voters to understand what it means to select a president. So, just to give a context into this form, because there are a lot of people that are watching this that are outside of the United States, what is the pain point that this program is trying to solve? Because, any person would imagine, yes, there's an election, every person wants to vote because we all want to select our next leader, right? But that's not exactly the case. Well, that is one issue. One is that people don't always choose to go and vote. They feel that their vote doesn't matter or they don't really have the wherewithal to understand what does it mean to choose a leader of a country. I mean, most of us, we just, we come out of high school, we come out of college, whatever, we go vote. Nobody ever taught us anything more than, okay, this is the day, this is the place, this is what you go do. But the actual understanding of how you select a candidate, it's very easy, I think, for all of us to be a bit lazy. Like I'm a Democrat, I'm just going to vote the Democratic ticket, or I'm a Republican. But personally, as an independent, I can't really do that. I need to be more thoughtful. But what this is pushing people to do is to be more thoughtful by creating a one to two hour engaged experience, non partisan, non issue specific, but very much a fun interactive process for thinking about what are you looking for in a candidate, like what are the leadership characteristics that it takes to be a president; what does it take to be a president in a crisis; what did it take for our past presidents, like which ones do you think of as successful and why. And then, really take all of that and wrap it into a new way of understanding how you might select in the next election; how you might watch a debate differently. Like I was watching the campaign last night, the fourth day of the convention for the Democrats. And just so interesting how leaders are introduced themselves. But if you don't have that lens, if you're not looking at that, you're just looking for the slogans or that, the rah rah, you may forget that this is selecting the leader, as we call it, of the free world, right? Of the United States. And that is an awesome responsibility that we want to prepare. So, it sounds like the solution that is proposed to, it's less of about trying to actively going and telling people, "You should go vote, this is important." But get them to actively think intrinsically what matters to them in a leader, and then by having them be more thoughtful about it and be more caring about it, that will create the agency for them to go and take action and hopefully propel this within their own community, right? I couldn't have said it better myself, Michael. Wonderful. So, how has this been going? Is this something that's being active right now as we're nearing the election? What's been wonderful about it is that we're being able to get this spread across schools, across libraries, across community centers, so that we created these tools freely available on the website, www.votebydesign.org, and we're giving them away to anyone and everyone. Including a facilitator guide, all the materials you need so that you can run these sessions. And so, we're encouraging people as many as possible in high schools and above to run sessions like this. And what we are finding is that teachers love this, community leaders love this because it's all done for you. You can learn how to facilitate this in an hour. The session can be anywhere. Yeah. Very easy to facilitate. I participated in one of the first sessions and just fell in love with the whole idea. I thought it was so clever. And even at my age, having voted for many years, what was wonderful was to have a new lens provided for me as I make these decisions. I honestly had never really thought about how I choose a president. I never really thought about is it more important, this versus that. So, I think that these kinds of conversations and these kind of engage perspective is what we need to have a citizenship with agency, as you said. I love it. And I love the scalability because my next question was going to be it's great to have these sessions, but it seems that it's not really scalable. Bringing people together in a room, teaching a moderator, having a personal interaction with the participants, but if you're able to make this as simple as an hour for somebody to become a good facilitator and then take them to their own community and create agency within them, then obviously the butterfly effect just continues from there. That is so so cool. Denise, we only have a couple of minutes left. But I have to know a little bit more about you and what you're truly passionate about. Because we're talking about the future of health care running organizations. We're talking about empowering women and the leadership position and venture capital. Now, we're talking about politics and giving agency to citizens, especially young people. What are you really passionate about? What really motivates you? My motivation is changing the world. It just as simple as that. I want to make a difference. I want to leave a legacy that matters. And I think what's wonderful about the organizations I started is they're all still in existence. They're all still going strong. And that's what it means to be a startup person. If you do it well, you put in the bases that are going to allow others to build on top of them, and that's what I've been doing my whole career. So, what are some things that I can take with me as I go on my entrepreneurial journey? So, I'm pretty much at the point where you were at when you started your first company, and now I get to take some of your insights and go with them. So, what things should I be keeping in mind as I go on my journey to hopefully make a positive impact on the world? Well, I will say the most important thing I've learned, if I only had one, it would be, don't build a company because it's cool or it's the fun thing to do. Only build organizations and companies where people already are asking for what you are building. So, every time I've been successful, it's because there was a need and it was expressed. In fact, I was usually doing whatever it was for free before anybody ever paid me because people kept calling and meeting that service or that whatever I was trying to put out in the world, that product. And so, the time that I did not do that, when I just thought it was a cool idea, and I'm just going to go build it, nothing happened, right? But when I build something people already are asking for, so, I say to listen, if you listen to the marketplace, it tells you what is needed and where the money lay and where the audience is lay and that you can just go pick those up and go forward. That's the best goal to build a company. Denise, thank you for being so generous with your time. This was wonderful. I have one last question. And that is three words that you would use to describe yourself. Well, I would say anybody who knows me would say the most important thing to know is that I'm very well connected and I think that's part and parcel of the life that I've built. It's very connected in many different communities. I'd say the second, which you've already picked up on is I'm very eclectic. Like, I don't have just one thing I'm interested in. And then third, I'm really passionate and energized about making change. I love it. Denise, thank you very very much. Continue doing good for the world, and I look forward to following your journey and hopefully reconnecting along the way and continue to ask for advice and support. So, thank you very very much. You're welcome, Michael. It's great to talk with you. Me too.
