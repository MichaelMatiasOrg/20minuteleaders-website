All right. Ariel Tseitlin, good morning. Good morning. How are you doing? I'm doing well. How are you today? Good. It's an interesting time. I feel like everybody's almost adjusted to this new normal, right? Yeah. I mean, I don't know, if you want to call it normal, but it certainly is a new way of experiencing life. Definitely. I mean after, what it's been, like twelve weeks already, waking up and just opening the computer and getting ready for the first meeting. Not even thinking about which office I have to go to. I mean, that's unfortunately for me, already becoming a new norm. But we can only be helpful. Ariel, such an impressive background. And I can't wait to talk to you about scaling and about cyber security. And your different experiences from an MBA at Wharton to being an executive within Netflix, and really overseeing some incredible incredible scale, and different challenges there that I'd love to hear about. And now, going to be a partner at Scale Venture Partners. And sitting on the boards of some incredible companies like Honeycomb and PerimeterX, whom I admire. Ariel, who are you? Give me a little bit of a rundown, and then I have some some deep dives that I want to do with you. Sure. So first, I'll give you the geographical history. So, originally from Georgia in the former Soviet Union, the country, not the state, which is something I would like to preface or [--] with. Moved at a young age to Israel. Spent about seven years there growing up as a kid. And then, my dad got a job here in the Bay Area and moved here, about the end of middle school. And lived in the Bay Area ever since. From a career standpoint, I really followed my father's footsteps. He was a software engineer back when they weren't called software engineers. And he just really taught me the ins and outs of programming. And I enjoyed that from just a very young age. When did you start programming? Say again? When did you start programming? I started programming back in Israel. Gosh, I think I was, so, I left Israel when I was 10. And this was a couple of years before I left. So, probably, seven or eight. My mom signed me up for some basic programming class for teenagers. But she had some a connection there. They were able to get me on early because I was just very interested in it. I mean, today with Code Monkey and all these different softwares, if you're seven and eight and you're not coding yet, you're a little bit out of the game. But in your time, so, going to programming at seven or eight, that's pretty unheard of. Yeah, it was fine. I got my first Commodore 64, which was the first computer I played around with and had just incredible amount of fun with it. So, when I came to the states I knew what my career path was without thinking about it too much. So, I went and got computer science degree from UC Berkeley. And started out as a software engineer. Had an incredible fulfilling time doing it for a number of years. And then, got a little a little bored with just the coding side of it. And I was at Siebel Systems at the time. And the company was just growing like crazy. This was back in the late '90s. And I got the opportunity to manage a team. So, I said, "Hey, why not?" "This looks interesting." And the different challenge that I don't understand anything about. So, what could possibly go wrong? And so, I started managing a team and really went into engineering management from there. What was it like doing that transition from an engineer to managing a team of engineers? I made that transition early in the IDF and it was a little bit different from what I expected it to be. Yeah. I really enjoyed it. Particularly back then, as a first time manager, I think, these days too, of the first my manager, I mean, you're really going to bridging the gap between being one of the experts, from the expert from the technical side, which is, what got you successful and got you the opportunity to become a manager. To learning how to handle the human side of it and the interpersonal side of it, and the team and dynamics of it. And so, this is I think, a common thread that goes through my selection process when I think about opportunities. And both on the job side as well as project side is. If I don't feel like I am learning more than I am teaching, then I just get a little bit bored in a particular role that I'm in. So, for that, it was like, this is a whole new world. I don't understand very much about it. It sounds really interesting. And so, I went, I took Siebel at the time, had a bunch of internal classes that I took around situational leadership. And you know, the usual slate, right? And I did try to get up to speed on being a first line manager. And I loved all that. And so, it was a very different set of muscles that you have to build. You have to know how to talk and understand people rather than code, which is very different. Code is much more predictable, I would say. But I enjoyed it. And so, that got me started down that path. And then, I got promoted fairly quickly into different bigger and bigger teams. And then, Siebel got acquired by Oracle back in, it was in 2006. And so, that was a time for me to say, "Pause." And say, "Okay, what's next?" Oracle. I don't want to disparage the company in any way. But it was never on my list of, hey, this is the company that I wanted to go work for. It was a relatively large organization. And that wasn't what really appealed to me. I really like the small team, and at the startup entrepreneurial side of things. So, I decided to stay at Oracle post the acquisition, but go back and fulfill an earlier part of my desire in my career, which was get a better understanding of the other side of the business. I went I did my computer science undergrad at Cal. I also, my plan was to do a double major in business. And as many plans, that one's didn't come into complete fruition. So, you settled for an MBA at Wharton? Say again? So, you settled for an MBA at Wharton? Yes, that's right. That's right. So, I decided to do the MBA work. It was actually a funny story because I made the decision, it was one of those things that, you think about it for years, but then you make the decision on a dime. And so,  I made a decision, I think, within like a couple of weeks of the application due date. I remember my family and I were going to Tahoe over the holiday break in December. And that was when the applications were due. And so, I was busy writing my entrance essay for why they should take me, as my friends and family were skiing on the slopes. But anyway, Wharton was a great experience. Particularly coming from such a heavy tech background, I had a really hard time understanding what the other side of the business did. I was, looked at like sales and marketing as overhead. So, what are those guys doing? We're doing all the hard stuff. We're building everything. They're out there trying to have drinks and dinner with customers. And living life while we're paying their bills, while we're also working hard building, right? We meet in the engineers of the company. So, I figure, there's something there that I wanted to understand better ourselves. So, Wharton gave me, I think, a great perspective on that. It was a really rewarding experience. I would do it again in a heartbeat if I had the chance. Part of the appeal to me was, again, I just loved learning so much. That this was just an intensive period of learning. Where I was spending 20 hours a week, probably, while working at Oracle and doing classes and meetings and all that. And I just had a tremendous amount of fun. I love that. Ariel, when did you get excited about scaling? The word scale. Well, I mean, it was almost, it's funny you say that. Because it was never really something I pursued. It was something in the background that had to be done, right? It's almost like good design. It's not really something you, at least for me, it wasn't something I got passionate about. But, as I went through these different experiences, it was something that I started developing, more and more experience. And whether it's starting from smaller companies and building them into larger teams and companies, or it was the technical side of scaling and starting out with a handful of users that are mostly are friends and family and going to thousands and millions of users. That was almost something that had to be done. That you think about your success and pre-plan for your success early on, rather than a path that I followed. So, Netflix I think Netflix was the time when that understanding of scaling and how to build scalable and distributed systems really emerged for me. [--] Yeah. You're the director of Cloud Solutions at Netflix. One of the most heavy consumers of any cloud infrastructure you can imagine. I mean, that must be a crazy experience in terms of scale, in terms of responsibility. To understand how to operate at scale, right? I mean, this is unprecedented scale. Yeah. I mean, in Netflix, I had the luxury of actually working at a place like Netflix. And Netflix, and I got to tell you, if you don't already know, just an incredible company. The management culture there, and just the kind of people that the company is able to attract is just incredible. I've never been in any other organization where I felt the team was, well, I take that back, there were maybe one other time when we had a group of 10 people that were the most the highest, best tech people in the company who put together for a small project. But outside of that, in any kind of scale, a thousand engineers, I think, was roughly the size of the organization when I was there on Netflix and working. Everyone you go to is just, knows what they're doing. Expert. And not just that, but also, like a mature individual. Not somebody that has to be a manager. We read for one of my classes at Stanford, we read there, seven of your 100 page slide. The Culture Deck. Yeah. The Culture Deck. Unbelievable. I mean, that was just incredible to see. Yeah. I mean, I'll tell you a funny one if you want stories. I'll tell you a funny story. Before Netflix, I was at a company called Sungevity, which was also pretty cool company. They were doing residential solar. And my team was responsible for technology, which was the first time in the industry that allowed homeowners to get a solar system design for their roofs, without ever having the contractor come after their homes and measured it, right? So, we use aerial satellite imagery in order to create three dimensional models and design. And then have a remote solar to design it, but, it's less relevant. I was on the management team there. I was running the technology part of the business. And the last executive management team meeting that I was in the company, was all of us sitting down and reviewing the Netflix culture slides as a management team, and saying, "This is a great set of cultures slides." "As inpirationally, what can we pick from these things to incorporate into our organization?" Amazing. And then, a month or two later, I think, I was at the company of Netflix. So, that was serendipitous. And funny enough, it wasn't even planned. So, I didn't actually go and apply there. I connected to somebody at a social gathering who was working there and he got me introduced. So, Netflix, the picture of scaling there was just incredible. And I'd say, not just from the technical side, also, organizationally. Like the way that they were able to scale this freedom and responsibility culture there, which I still, to this day quote and love, is one that I just, I haven't seen effective anywhere else. And that just empowers individuals to do just amazing things. Wow. That's incredible. So, I want to move on to Scale Venture Partners. Because I think, the work that you're doing there is really incredible. And your expertise side on the industries you're focused on. And I'd love you to tell me a little bit more, what does it mean. What is Scale Venture Partners? And what is it about cloud infrastructure, cyber security, the companies you invest in? And why are you so excited about that? Because you're also coming from a very management background. And not too many people who go also the management route have that passion for cybersecurity and infrastructure. Yet you seem to have that interesting junction of the both of them. Yeah. As with most things, some was by design. And in some, was just the path that ended up being taken. So, first, I'll give you a blurb about scale. Scale, it's been around for a few decades now. I joined, thankfully, a team that was fully formed and extremely successful. So, that was a wonderful organization to join. That it was already successful and doing great things. So, I joined in 2013. And I was doing fund for the firm. And we're now currently on fund six, and will at some point be raising fund seven. The mission of the firm is really to help companies once they build a product and have some initial market validation to take those early revenues. And scale and build it into the business, right? So, the term "scale", that refers to scaling organizations, scaling revenues, scaling businesses. So, what we don't invest in is typically the seed stage. When it's, the folks coming out of university and they have an idea, or out of industry and they have an idea and they want the capital in order to build that. That's the part of the market that we don't address from a capital standpoint. But once they expand, they're six, 12, 18 months, whatever. Building it, getting some initial design partners, getting some market validation and some early revenues, that's where we get involved. Typically series As, series Bs, series Cs. Different stages in that scaling phase and help them build those revenues. And a lot of what the firm's resources are oriented around, is, how do you avoid some of the common scaling mistakes. When do you hire. When's the right time to hire. And what are some of these biggest mistakes in business? I was just gonna say, most often the time, the answer is, when you think it's the time to hire, it means probably it's too late. You should've started six months ago or 12 months ago. I've been hearing that so much. Yeah. When do you start building some of these processes in place around understanding conversion, around understanding your pipeline generation. All of this go to market side of the business, which is usually the set up systems that you have to build after you've got the product and you've been successful getting your product to market. So, that's the idea of scale. And we've had the, I guess, the, I'd say part luck. Part, our own picking, selected some great companies to be part of the portfolio, and some great successes in the past. Something I'm particularly proud of, in terms of my own. When you do join a company, and you join their journey as they're about to scale, so, let's say they're raising their series A, they have some paying customers, they have had a market validation, and they're ready to scale their product and to grow it, What role do you take in helping them do that? Are you more of, sort of a bystander who is just over looking and giving them a Yea or Nay? Are you very active in looking at their plan and talking to their customers, and understanding whether they actually have market validation or, if they're just under the false assumption? Where do you fit in there? Yeah, we talked to a lot of customers before we make the investment. So, that's typically part of our diligence process is to understand, Is there really a fit there. Is their product market fit there. And so, we do, we'll talk to a couple dozen different customers. Both customers, as well as prospects, as well as folks in our own network who would be typical buyers and to validate that there's a product market fit there. So, that typically happens before we make the investment. And so, we get to that level of conviction. And by the way, is that easier as you're more concentrated on a specific industry? So, if you're concentrated on cloud infrastructure and cybersecurity, Yeah. Absolutely. Because it's all the same players come up quite often, right? Well, that's one. And then the other is, you just have a much better ability to determine the quality of the answers you're getting, right? So, you can put people in the bucket of these folks understand it, because they understand the complexities of the world. And when it comes to infrastructure, and it might be early adopters, and early signals, or these folks are just going to do what they read about in the technical press. And then, that gives you a different type of data point. So, I certainly think having that experience, I think let's you understand where the market is going, maybe a few months, a few quarters earlier than when it would be otherwise obvious. So, back to your question around how involved do we get, I mean, the answer is, fairly involved. And this is something that I personally find extremely satisfying and rewarding about this role is, I don't want to be there sitting once a quarter, or saying: Yea or Nay, Do this. Don't do this. Because I don't think that's effective. In the areas where I feel I can add value, I get fairly involved in those. Those fall into a couple of different buckets, One is, well, what's the expertise of the firm. That's certainly something that we have a lot of resources and personal experience with. And that's around, how do you scale revenues, and how do you build some of these systems I mentioned. And then the other side is around just the product and the technical side of it. And that's something that I think, I bring uniquely from my own background. In understanding how to build engineering teams, understanding how to build products and even some of the technical and scaling side of it. One of the first things I did when I started scale, before I could really add any value on the venture side, because I was completely new to venture when I first joined, is, I went round to different portfolio companies and essentially gave them my talk that I used to give it Netflix, around, Hey, how do you build large, scalable, distributed systems that are fault tolerant and resilient? And that was something that was very valuable to those engineering teams. But also because you got to experience the portfolio companies potentially at a deeper way than a lot of other partners did. Because from understanding also, not every partner is involved with every company. And you got to understand the portfolio a little bit better. Ariel, the last minute that we have, are there specific places that the market is going to that you're especially excited about that? That young people coming out of 8200 or Stanford could be thinking up in the realms of cloud infrastructure, cyber security. The world has changed dramatically over the past few months. What are some of the the key places that you think bright minds should put their effort? You know, that's a really good question. And I can give you an answer to that question. But my first reaction to that would be, don't listen to anything that a venture capitalist or investor tells you. It should be the area that you're focusing on. Because honestly, even I come from a fairly technical background, but it's now seven years since I've been an operator. And my information is, it's gotten fairly fast, okay, right? And so, whatever I think it is, it's probably things that I've heard from others. And, what I would encourage folks to do is understand, from their own vantage point where are gaps in the market and then build to that. Because, it's those folks that are in the trenches, that are building it, that are understanding where those challenges lie. That I think, is the best position. We figure it out later after it's been built, and after the customers already tell us that this is something. So, my initial answer, in terms of specific areas, I think the cloud infrastructure side of things is just extremely nascent at this point. We're in the very very early days of having, we've just released DMs, right? As a technology, when it comes to fast forward to the equivalent and the infrastructure. So, every company that's doing anything at a reasonable scale from an engineering standpoint, needs to build its own platform from the ground up. And usually constructed in different pieces. So, I'm still waiting to see who will solve this problem, who is going to come up with a way of building cloud native applications where you don't have to custom built to AWS and GCP and USHER, and you don't have to worry about scaling up. You see two instances. You don't have to worry about setting up security groups and ELBs and so on. So, like that piece of it, I think is still missing. So, that's one that I'm always on the lookout for on the infrastructure side. The other side of it, I think there's also around various parts in the development lifecycle. I hear that a lot. Yeah. Yeah. As the infrastructure changes, the management and orchestration and workflow piece of it has to change as well. So, whether it's in software or quality or in deployment, each one of those pieces is, every time there's a shift in the underlying infrastructure, the management side of it has to solve. As a software engineer myself, going through these processes and working on a variety of projects, both professionally, academically, I definitely see that as a huge potential and a place that I'm personally very excited about. Ariel, before we leave, I have to ask you the hardest question putting you on the spot one last time, three words that you would use to describe yourself, or that any of your partners at Scale Venture Partners, would describe you as. I don't want to answer that question. I hate talking about myself. And certainly is not something I enjoy. That's definitely, I think, a valuable answer. Maybe, I say Curious. I'll take curious. Curious is good enough for all three. And I appreciate the response. And I think, that's also something that is, I think, quite interesting with people who are really excited about helping others accomplish things and watching a lot of great people around them succeed. And I truly truly appreciate it. Ariel, thank you for your time. Toda raba. Absolutely. I mean, I'll leave your listeners with one last talk, which is, I think everybody who is your peer right now has an incredible place in life that you don't get to experience very often. You're the world. The world is the opportunity right now. And so, don't listen to everybody that says, "No.", for every one of your ideas. Because you're gonna get 100 Nos for Every every you Yes you get. So, have the passion. Have the conviction to do what you believe in. And I think you'll have an incredible time in your life. 100%. Ariel, toda raba. Thank you very much. Thanks. Great time. Bye bye.
