1
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,000
All right. Lou Adler, 
thank you so much

2
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,300
for joining me 
on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,300
Hey, happy to be here. 
Thank you very much, Michael.

4
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,300
Really, really happy 
to have you here.

5
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,300
Best-selling author in Amazon, 
"The Essential Guide to Hiring"

6
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,300
and "Hire with Your Head," 
and really a world expert

7
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,300
on what it means to do 
intelligent hiring

8
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,300
and getting hired, 
and performance-based hiring.

9
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,700
Lou, can you tell me 
a little bit about --

10
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,300
a little bit about your background

11
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,300
and how did you even 
get sucked into this incredible

12
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,300
industry of thinking about hiring?

13
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,300
Well, that’s really 
a good question.

14
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,300
It’s really good for engineers too 
because my background

15
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,300
is an engineer, 
if you look at my background.

16
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,300
Okay.
Guides and control systems.

17
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,300
Got an MBA

18
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,300
in Finance and Accounting, 
then started working

19
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,300
in manufacturing, logistics, 
cost accounting, budgeting,

20
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,300
planning, host of different things.

21
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,300
Aerospace,

22
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,300
handheld consumer electronics 
and automotive, a whole bit.

23
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,300
And the only reason I actually --

24
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,300
I was running a 
manufacturing company.

25
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
It was 40 years ago. 
Hated the boss.

26
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,300
I mean, I got pissed off 
every single --

27
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,300
every other week 
when he came down,

28
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,300
he and I just argued 
and I quit every --

29
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
every other week, 
I’d quit for a year.

30
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:08,800
Wow!

31
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Finally quit. 
Decided to become a recruiter.

32
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:18,800
And this is the interesting thing 
as an engineering person,

33
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
especially with 
manufacturing background.

34
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,800
I could see the hiring process 
was just like making parts.

35
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
I didn’t care if it was 
automotive parts or rocket ship.

36
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,700
Because I worked on 
guiding systems.

37
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,300
Could it be assembly line?

38
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,300
It was automotive, components --

39
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,300
it’s just you have 
to manage yields.

40
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,300
You have to understand 
what’s the product.

41
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,300
You have to have a design spec. 
You have to have manufacturing

42
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,300
process and you have to manage it 
every step of the way from concept,

43
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,300
from even how you procure parts 
to final inspection

44
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,300
and inspection in between. 
Most people in hiring

45
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,300
don’t see it that way.

46
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,300
My background as a systems engineer 
made it a little bit easier,

47
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,300
predicting in Finance 
and Accounting, and I said,

48
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
"Hey, it’s more than 
just making parts.

49
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,300
You have to control the cost. 
You have to get --

50
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,300
influence people.

51
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,300
So, very unusual 
background for hiring.

52
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,300
And then, I was also a recruiter. 
I’ve probably recruited

53
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,300
because I’m --

54
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,300
I was in college, 
part of a fraternity.

55
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,300
I was the recruiting guy.

56
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,300
-Of course.
- It was all did.

57
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,300
So, it’s like I was designed 
to be a recruiting person.

58
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,800
I love it.

59
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Lou, why is recruiting hard?

60
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,500
Why is hiring and getting hired 
a puzzle that confuses everybody?

61
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,500
Well, it is a puzzle. 
It’s a great, great question.

62
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
A puzzle, it’s because 
it’s multi-dimensional.

63
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
It’s not one-dimensional, 
two-dimensional, three --

64
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
it’s actually five 
or six dimensions,

65
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,500
and just getting one
dimension right is hard.

66
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
On top of that, 
you got human nature,

67
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,500
which is one of the dimensions. 
People make decisions.

68
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,000
Candidates get nervous. 
Hiring managers don’t know

69
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,500
what they’re looking for. 
HR overwhelms them

70
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,500
with cost and budgets, 
and compliance issues

71
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
that don’t help.

72
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,000
People think that the best people 
are just going to apply

73
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,500
to a job posting 
and go through

74
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
the demeaning process. 
You got all these variables

75
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:02,500
that impact the decision itself. 
And then, you got all you.

76
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
All the kids going to school, 
getting engineering degrees.

77
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,000
I know for a fact 
you’re not going to make

78
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,500
the decision alone. 
You get an offer,

79
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,500
you’re going to ask 
your friends and family,

80
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
- "Hey, is this a good job?"
- Of course.

81
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,500
And if you’re getting paid 5% less,

82
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,500
People are, "Oh, you're not taking 
that stupid job, are you, Michael?

83
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,500
I mean, all these stupid reasons 
that people take dumb decisions.

84
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
But that’s what happens. 
Then you get older, you make

85
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,000
even dumber decisions.

86
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,500
And then, you make a bad 
decision, you suck it up

87
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
and you kiss [expletive], 
and all this stuff happens.

88
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,500
And then, if you get married 
and your wife says

89
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
you got to make more money. 
So, you take a stupid job

90
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
because of more money.

91
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
You know, all these stuff. 
That’s why it’s hard.

92
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,500
Right. And why do you call 
these dumb decisions?

93
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
So, what is it about these 
decisions that you

94
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,500
don’t consider them intelligent 
or performance-based?

95
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
Okay. So, let me go back 35 years.

96
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,000
- All right.
- This is --

97
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,500
-- a true story.

98
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
There was a guy named John Morgan.

99
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
I had a job offer for him

100
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
as a plant manager 
in an electronics

101
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
manufacturing company. 
The company at that time

102
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,500
was making high- definition displays,

103
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
at least at that time, 
and they’re moving into --

104
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
the displays are really 
becoming unusual.

105
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Liquid crystal and other stuff.
I thought I had the job closed.

106
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,500
It was a good job

107
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Probably, in today's dollars,
2020 dollars,

108
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Probably $150K to $200K.

109
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,500
I would have gotten 
a 30% fee for that.

110
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
So, good fee for me.

111
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
He was going to --

112
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
He told me on Monday 
he was taking the offer.

113
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,000
On Wednesday, 
he called me up and said,

114
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,500
"I’m not taking your offer. 
I got a better offer."

115
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,500
And he told me why. 
He said, "Well, better title,

116
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,000
closer to home, more money." 
And then, I said,

117
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,500
"Well, tell me 
a little bit about it."

118
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,500
And he told me the company, 
told me the compensation,

119
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
told me everything 
about it. I said,

120
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,500
"John, you just made 
a long-term strategic decision

121
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
using short-term 
tactical information.

122
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
That’s a dumb de --

123
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
No, I didn’t say to him
that was a dumb decision.

124
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
I was desperate. 
That’s what I just came up with.

125
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
And he said, 
"What are you talking about?

126
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
I said, "Everything you said 
is about what you got

127
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,500
on the start date. 
Start date is a compensation.

128
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,000
It was only like 3% to 5% more. 
It was the title of the job,

129
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,500
better than the one he had. 
The drive was 15 minutes closer.

130
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,000
I said, "John, what you do 
for the next 2 to 3 years

131
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,500
will impact the rest of your life. 
You’re going into

132
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
an industry that’s declining --"

133
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,500
whatever it was, 
electronic assembly processes

134
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,500
that were outdated.. 
I said, "You’re going to be

135
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
going into this industry. 
In 3 to 5 years when you come out,

136
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
you’ll be no better 
than you are today.

137
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
So, you just put 
a lid on your career."

138
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
On the other hand, 
if you go to this other job

139
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
that are putting 
state of-the-art displays,

140
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,500
they’re going overseas --

141
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
I know the title’s 
a little bit less,

142
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
but you’re going to put

143
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
yourself in a better 
career trajectory.

144
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
But how can you --

145
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
- and I’m looking at myself --
- Let me finish the story.

146
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
- Let me finish the story 
because it's --

147
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,500
-  Go ahead. Yeah. I'm sorry.
- But it’s a good story.

148
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
He calls me the next day, he says, 
"I’m taking your offer."

149
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Nine months later, 
he calls me back and said,

150
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,500
"Lou, best decision I ever made. 
Best thing you’ve ever said to me

151
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
about making a strategic 
career decision.

152
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,000
I’ve now been made VP Operations. 
We’re making three

153
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,500
plants in China." 
This was when China was expanding.

154
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,500
The idea, if you have to 
make career decisions,

155
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
not day one decisions. 
So, focus on --

156
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
decision-making is 
what you’re going to

157
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,500
be doing in year one and beyond, 
not what you get on the start date.

158
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
And all the people who 
advise you will be focusing

159
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
on the start date. 
What's your comp?

160
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
What’s your title?

161
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Is it cool? 
Is it this and that?

162
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,500
That’s the dumb decision 
and all your advisers

163
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
will focus on the dumb decision stuff,

164
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
not the long-term career decision.

165
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
And that’s, if I have 
any message to say,

166
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
just focus on what 
you’re going to be doing

167
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
and becoming, not what 
you get on the start date.

168
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
I think that’s incredible. 
I was just taking

169
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,000
a fascinating class at the 
Stanford Business School

170
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,500
with Professor Demarest.

171
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,500
He was the Head of Communications 
for George Bush Sr.

172
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,500
during his presidency. 
And the whole class was about

173
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,500
how strategy equals context 
and how you --

174
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
when you're approaching a decision 
and you have the facts

175
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,500
on the sheet of paper, 
it seems like an easy decision,

176
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
but you’re missing 
the most important factor,

177
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
which is the context 
of the decision.

178
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,500
And what you’re describing 
is exactly the same thing.

179
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,500
The context is the career. 
It’s not this moment of time

180
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
and how much 
you’re going to get today.

181
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Well, let me give you 
another story because

182
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,000
that’s what I do, tell --

183
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,500
When you're my age, 
you tell stories.

184
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
I love stories. Yes.

185
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,500
So, I have an MBA from UCLA. 
My first year, I became

186
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
a financial analyst. 
I also had an engineering degree.

187
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
And I was at the 
corporate headquarters

188
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
of the 35th largest company 
in the country.

189
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,500
All I was doing was 
showing the slides.

190
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,000
That’s all I was doing. 
I was in an operations

191
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,500
review meeting. 
The group president was there,

192
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
the chairman of the company, 
the CFO and I was nervous as heck.

193
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,500
I was like 25. Nervous. 
So full nervous.

194
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
I didn’t even want to say  a word. 
I was even nervous

195
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
flipping the slides. 
That’s what they did in those days.

196
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,500
I mean I was so nervous 
being in front of all these

197
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,500
powerful people. 
The CFO of this corporation

198
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,500
had a group president.

199
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:48,500
It was probably a $3 billion group. 
And the CFO of the parent company

200
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,500
said to this group president, 
he said, "Strategy drives tactics.

201
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
And I don’t care how good 
the tactics you are,

202
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
your strategy sucks.

203
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Get the [expletive] 
out of this room,

204
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,000
and come back with 
a good strategy, because

205
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,500
you’re wasting everybody’s time."

206
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Wow!

207
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
And this is massive. 
You’re 25 years old.

208
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,500
and hearing this comment 
to a group president,

209
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,500
I was just blown away.

210
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
But it’s driven --

211
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
that was the idea of strate --

212
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
if you have the wrong strategy,

213
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
it doesn’t matter 
what you’re doing.

214
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
You’re going to waste your time. 
Now, we go back to hiring.

215
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,500
I believe too many people 
have the wrong talent strategy.

216
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
They feel they can 
weed out the weak

217
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,000
rather than attract the best. 
And when you attract the best,

218
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,500
you have to nurture him. 
You have to spend more time

219
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
with people, they have  understand 
the job requirements.

220
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,000
When you weed out the weak, 
they got to go through a funnel,

221
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
in an automated impersonal funnel 
and endure the inhumanity

222
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,500
of applying for a job, 
and then not being told

223
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,500
and all those other stuff. 
So, it’s the fundamental

224
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,500
attracting strategy versus 
a weed-out-the-weak strategy.

225
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
So, at the corporate level, 
it’s a strategy problem.

226
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
At the individual level, 
making a decision,

227
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,500
it’s also a strategy problem.

228
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,500
So then, tangibly, 
looking at my generation --

229
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,500
and let’s look, for example, 
at the engineering demographic,

230
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
people who are 
coming out of college

231
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
with an engineering degree 
and they’re faced

232
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,500
with an insurmountable 
number of opportunities

233
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
ranging from start-ups 
to corporates,

234
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,500
to financial institutions.

235
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,000
How do you go about making 
a decision for yourself?

236
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,500
And how --?

237
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,500
And then, I’d like to flip 
the conversation on how does

238
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,500
the hiring manager can look 
at 22-year-old candidates

239
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,500
and determine whether they will be 
a good fit for their company

240
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
with no previous experiences?

241
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Well, that’s a great question.

242
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
And it’s --

243
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
So, I’m going to give you 
my biased viewpoint.

244
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Of course.

245
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,500
My first job as an engineer 
was in a big corporation.

246
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,500
When I got my MBA, 
it was still at a big corporation.

247
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,500
So, I learned how 
big corporations function.

248
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
I learned how engineers 
in big corporations function.

249
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,200
And my first manager, 
a really cool manager --

250
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,500
it was an aerospace company 
and I was a systems engineer

251
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
for a nuclear missile program.  
And he said, "I don’t want you

252
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,500
to do any work," this 22 years old. 
"I don’t what you to do any work."

253
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
I want you to answer 
these two questions."

254
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,500
And he said, "Why does E = mc2 
and why can’t you

255
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,500
push on a rope?" 
I said, "I don’t need to go

256
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
to the meeting, but I know 
the answer to both

257
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
of those questions." 
He said, "No,

258
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
you don’t know the answer. 
That’s why you have to --

259
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
I want you to meet everybody 
in the company and I’ll take you

260
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
out to lunch on Thursday. 
And we’ll discuss your

261
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
answers on Thursday." 
So, this was four days.

262
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
All he said, "All I want you to do 
is talk to everybody

263
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
and get the answers 
to those two questions."

264
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Wow!

265
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Well, the idea that I got was that, 
at a big company,

266
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
you had to have a good manager.

267
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
So, if you don’t have 
a good manager,

268
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,500
it’s kind of you’re getting lost.

269
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
So, I always had 
good managers to help

270
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
and mentor. 
So, they help you.

271
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,500
But the idea was 
the technology for engineer,

272
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,500
could've --  yeah, 
it's important. But you can’t convince

273
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,500
other people, albeit,  
by proving a technology.

274
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,500
You have to influence them 
using different set of skills.

275
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,500
I don’t want to call them 
soft skills.

276
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,500
They're non-technical skills.

277
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,500
How do you convince somebody 
who has a point of view

278
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
that’s not the same 
as what your point of view is?

279
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
That’s skill 
and that’s what I learned.

280
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
I mean, I didn’t learn it.

281
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,000
I understood it 
by the fourth day on the job,

282
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,500
because I had 
to meet everybody.

283
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
It was 35 engineers.

284
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,000
Wow!

285
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So, it was kind of interesting.

286
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,500
Now, let me kind of say 
that story again

287
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,500
because this is as important 
-- of making a choice.

288
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,500
I took this job. 
I was going to engineering school

289
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,500
upstate New York. 
I took the job

290
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,500
in Southern California 
because on March of 1968

291
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
when I got my engineering degree 
upstate New York, it was snowing.

292
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,500
I got a call from a company 
in Southern California.

293
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,500
It was Vietnam. 
He said, "Lou, I’d like to make

294
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
you an offer." 
No interview.

295
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
"I’d like to make you an offer." 
I was a pretty good engineer.

296
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
I said, "What’s the weather?" 
That was my first question.

297
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,000
"What’s the weather?" 
"72 degrees."

298
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,500
I said, "Well, are you getting
the foreman?"

299
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
He said, "Absolutely. 
You’re going to work

300
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,500
on a nuclear guidance program 
for a Minuteman missile."

301
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
I said, "Will I get 
any relocation?"

302
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
He said, "Yes." And I had no money.

303
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
"How much?"

304
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,000
"$0.15 or $0.18 a mile."

305
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,500
I said, "When do I get that money?"

306
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,500
He said, "The day 
after you started."

307
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
I said, "I’ll take that offer." 
I mean, this was not real

308
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,500
rocket science offer, 
but this was interesting.

309
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
When I got there --

310
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,500
And these are brilliant people 
working on how to place

311
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,500
a nuclear missile 
using 1968 technology

312
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,500
within 100 yards of downtown, 
the enemy, Moscow in this case.

313
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Sorry for anybody in Russia. 
But that's what the plan was.

314
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
And they could do it. 
The guys hated the job.

315
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Hated the job. 
I thought it was pretty cool.

316
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
22, it was pretty cool.

317
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,500
I said, "Why --" 
as I got to know them

318
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
over the course of a year, 
they had all worked

319
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,000
on the lunar landing project. 
All of them.

320
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
- And they said, "We went --
- Wow!

321
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,500
five years, 24/7 doing 
exactly the same work."

322
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,500
But because the mission 
was important, they went all out.

323
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
Wow!

324
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
So, the work itself is important.

325
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,000
The team you’re 
working with is important.

326
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,500
But the mission is 
just as important.

327
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,000
If you’re doing something 
that’s important,

328
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,500
not just for you 
but for something else,

329
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,500
you just get totally motivated. 
It’s not work.

330
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,500
It’s just an exciting venture. 
That job was not

331
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,500
an exciting venture for me. 
I’d had others that were.

332
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
But if you can 
get the mission right,

333
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,500
boy, you’re in the game.

334
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
So, I don’t know if that’s 
the answer to your question --

335
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
- but it's the stories I share.
- No, a hundred percent.

336
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,500
And now, looking over the years 
as you’re becoming more and more

337
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
of an expert of hiring 
and you’re seeing all these

338
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,500
different case studies 
and you’re part of

339
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,500
these case studies, 
do you observe any different trends

340
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,500
in the young demographic 
on how we make --

341
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,500
how we make decisions 
on which companies

342
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
we join or what 
career paths we take?

343
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,500
Are there shifts 
through generations?

344
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Yeah, I think that 
there definitely are.

345
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
And this is the problem. 
I don’t think human nature --

346
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
I talk to guys 
not necessarily your age,

347
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,500
but certainly young people,
frequently, mid-label people,

348
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
and older people.

349
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,500
I have not seen a change 
in human nature

350
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,500
as a result of all 
that’s going on here.

351
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Smart people, smart people, 
there were smart people

352
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
20, 30, 40 50 years ago.

353
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,500
So, that has not changed. 
What happened

354
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
is the corporate world 
has changed a little bit.

355
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
I think --

356
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
So, if I had to make advice,

357
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
I’d say, you know, 
if you could get to a place

358
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
one to two, three years 
where you’d really

359
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
put on some kind of 
a rotation program

360
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,500
and really put in different series, 
that’s invaluable --

361
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,000
that just takes your education 
to another level.

362
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,500
Because now, you’ve seen how 
all these different functions work

363
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
and how you’ve learned 
how you can't push on a rope

364
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
and understanding that.

365
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
And I call them 
the non-technical skills.

366
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
There’s an article 
I wrote on LinkedIn.

367
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,500
It says, "The best technical skills 
in the world are a waste of time

368
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,500
if you don’t have 
a non-technical capability."

369
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,500
And I basically say 
that people get hired

370
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,500
for their technical skills, 
but they get fired for lack --

371
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
or they don’t get promoted 
for their lack of ability to work

372
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,300
with people, managing projects, 
keeping budgets,

373
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,000
making commitments.

374
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,500
And if you can’t put both 
of them together, it’s going to --

375
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,000
you’re going to be disappointed.

376
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,500
You’ll wonder, "Why? 
Why am I not getting ahead?

377
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
Why is this not happening?" 
It’s the soft skills --

378
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
I hate to call the word soft 
because it’s too important.

379
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,500
I call them non-technical skills. 
But it’s that combination

380
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,500
of both of them.

381
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,500
If you get an opportunity to do 
both of them, you’re in the game.

382
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
- If you don't get an opportunity --
- Of course.

383
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
And I think a start-up 
could be interesting,

384
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,500
but you don’t get the foundation 
of how to grow a company.

385
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
And that’s why I would be real 
concerned about a start-up,

386
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,000
pure start-up. I just --

387
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,300
Listen, the executives 
don’t know how to run a company

388
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,300
and you’re going to be in there 
not knowing how to run a company.

389
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,300
You’re going to have a --

390
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,300
It might be an interesting 
experience and a rocket ship ride,

391
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,300
but you’re not going to get the 
foundation you need

392
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,300
- So you mean you're -- 
- So I would say --

393
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,300
worried about somebody 
who has no experience

394
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,300
in the sort of the real, 
real world or the corporate world

395
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,300
running into --

396
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
running a start-up 
and being an executive of day one,

397
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,300
and being a leader of day one, 
not having experienced

398
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,300
some of these ropes themselves. 
But Lou. I also want to transfer

399
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,300
the conversation also 
to, hopefully, one day,

400
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,300
sooner rather than later, 
when I have my own venture

401
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,300
and I will hire people, 
and I will need to know

402
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,300
and I will hire people, 
and I will need to know

403
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,300
what people do I hire, 
and I will have to make

404
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,700
some decisions, 
what are the key things

405
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,300
that I should keep in mind 
in performance-based hiring

406
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,300
as you’ve written in your books?

407
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,300
Okay. So, here’s the --

408
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,300
It happened in a conversation 
this morning with

409
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,300
a head of research 
for a major search firm,

410
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,300
one of the top three 
search firms in the world.

411
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,300
And now, we're talking about 
diversity hiring.

412
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,300
How do really get --

413
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,300
hire diverse talent?

414
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,300
And I said, basically, 
it’s at the job description level.

415
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,300
And I --

416
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,300
when I -- I want to go back 
to my first search assignment,

417
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,300
which was 42 years ago. I knew 
the president of the company.

418
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,300
The company was making automotive 
components and no job description,

419
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,300
no list of --

420
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,700
Well, he did have a role at hand. 
He needs someone probably 10 years'

421
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,300
experience and a degree,

422
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,700
this school, and this 
kind of background.

423
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,300
I said, "You know, Mike, 
that’s not a job description."

424
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,300
- "That’s a person description." 
- Right.

425
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,300
A job doesn’t have experience. 
A job doesn’t have skills.

426
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,300
A person has that. 
Let’s put the job description

427
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,300
in the parking lot. 
What does the person

428
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,300
need to do to be successful?

429
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,300
- Right.
- I asked that question.

430
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,300
He said, "He got to turn 
around the plant."

431
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,700
I said, "Fine, let's walk 
through the plant."

432
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,300
Spent an hour 
walking through the plant.

433
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,700
Labor problems, logistics problems, 
warehousing problems,

434
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,300
manufacturing process problems, 
lack of control,

435
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,300
no quality control. 
I mean, it was

436
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
just a terrible plant. 
Looking at material

437
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,300
all over the plant floor, 
I said, "This is a terrible plant.

438
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,700
We’ll get someone to fix it." 
That was my first placement.

439
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,300
I have never used a job description

440
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,300
listing skills and 
experience since then.

441
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,300
I always ask the hiring manager, 
"What does the person

442
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,300
need to do to be successful." 
Five or six performance objectives.

443
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,300
Build a team of accountants 
to launch a new product.

444
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,300
Work with marketing 
and product management

445
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,300
to develop a new system 
that does A, B and C.

446
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,300
Put together a product roadmap 
for the next three years

447
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,300
based on industry trends. 
It’s stuff that people need to do.

448
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,300
So, if you don’t know that, 
how can you possibly

449
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,300
assess a person?

450
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,300
When I interview candidates, I say, 
"Hey, one of the big things

451
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,300
we have to do is put 
a product roadmap together

452
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,300
that looks at this series 
of economic considerations.

453
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,300
Have you ever done 
something like that?

454
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,300
Walk me through it." 
So, what I do is I define the job,

455
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,300
the series of performance 
objectives, and I ask candidates

456
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,300
to tell me about work 
they’ve done that’s most similar.

457
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,300
- And I look at the people 
- Okay.

458
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,300
who’ve done the most 
comparable work.

459
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,300
It doesn’t have to be identical, 
just comparable

460
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:04,300
in decision-making complexity, 
design, team, collaborative skills.

461
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,300
And then, I’m in the game. 
That opens a pool to everybody.

462
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,700
And I tell job candidates 
the same thing.

463
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,300
And is it still as 
relevant today when --

464
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,300
and especially engineers 
joining young companies.

465
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,300
The roles, while they may be 
defined in the beginning,

466
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,300
they change very critically 
and sporadically over time.

467
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:26,300
So, is that method of hiring 
for specific performance type,

468
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,300
is that still relevant 
to the very new --

469
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,700
Of course, yeah. Absolutely. 
I’d love to hear people,

470
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,300
I said --

471
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,000
Michael, tell me about 
your biggest project

472
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,300
you had at this company. 
How did that change you over time?

473
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,300
How did you deal with that change?

474
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,300
What was the biggest 
problem you faced?

475
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,300
What was the biggest 
gap you had to fill?

476
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,300
- Walk me through those things. 
- Right.

477
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,300
So, I’m looking for the ability 
to not only do the work,

478
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,300
but also to handle bigger projects.

479
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,300
I want to understand 
how you did it.

480
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,300
So, absolutely.

481
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,300
You just got to understand 
the environment.

482
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,300
- On the other hand,
- A hundred percent.

483
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,300
in the pace --

484
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,300
And  I look at company culture,

485
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,300
the biggest proxy’s 
the rate of change.

486
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,300
I mean, if you’ve never been 
through a rapid change --

487
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,300
like when I was in aerospace, 
it was like pushing on the last

488
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,300
and nothing would change. 
I’ve been at fast paced companies.

489
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,000
I was at the first handheld 
calculator company.

490
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,300
That was every day we changed.

491
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,700
It was more fun 
and that would have to be.

492
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,700
My best real-time job

493
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,700
was working as --

494
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,700
in the first handheld calculator -- 
They might even have one here.

495
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,700
- A hundred percent. 
-  Just to give you, guys,

496
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,700
a sense of what a handheld 
calculator was in 1972.

497
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,700
8K chip. 8K chip. 
All it could do was multiply,

498
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,700
add and subtract. 
Couldn’t divide because

499
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,000
it didn’t know how to round off.

500
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,700
- Oh, my god.
- We could not divide.

501
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,700
We got the 16K. 
It could divide,

502
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,000
but it couldn’t round off.

503
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Had to get the 32 --

504
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,700
I mean it was pretty bad. 
But it was fun.

505
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,300
I was in this chip factory,  
looking at buying them

506
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,300
and it was fun. 
But it was weird.

507
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,300
Different world but same problems.

508
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,300
Lou, you're just fascinating.

509
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,800
Thank you again 
for taking the time to do this.

510
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,300
I really appreciate it.

511
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,300
Before we leave, 
I have to ask you

512
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,300
for three words 
that you would use

513
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,300
to describe yourself.

514
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,500
Well, you actually asked me 
that at the beginning of this

515
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,000
and I was supposed to say 
but I’m actually

516
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,700
a pain in the ass. 
So, that’s maybe four words.

517
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,300
But the point being is 
don’t accept conventional wisdom.

518
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:05,800
If you’re --

519
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,800
And that’s why it’s hard 
because you have

520
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,700
so many competing objectives. 
So, if it’s a candidate --

521
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,700
you as a candidate, 
you’ve been into an interview.

522
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,700
You just got to ask the manager, 
"Hey, before we get into

523
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,700
my background in general, 
can you just tell me

524
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,700
a couple of things 
you need to get done in this job?

525
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,000
I’d like to give you examples 
of work that I’ve done

526
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,700
that might be most related." 
So, now you’re talking about

527
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,700
some real important stuff. 
You just got to push

528
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,000
the envelope and not just 
accept the fact that --

529
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I guarantee, 99% of the people
who interview you don’t know

530
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
what they’re doing. 
So, you have to take responsibility

531
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,700
to be interviewed accurately 
yourself and make sure that job

532
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,700
is the right one for you. 
And make the decision

533
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,700
based on where you’re going, 
not where you’ve been.

534
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,700
Hopefully, that’s helpful. 
Thanks, Michael.

535
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,700
I think that’s extremely relevant 
to everything that -- you know,

536
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,700
that my friends 
and I are going through.

537
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,700
And thank you for the advice. 
Thank you for your time.

538
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,300
Lou, have a great, great day 
and stay safe, and stay healthy.

539
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,700
You too. Thanks, guys.

540
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,700
Take care. Bye-bye.
