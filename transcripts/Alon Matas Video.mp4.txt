Alon Matas thank you for being here thank you for having me all right so better help, Corona online therapy we only have 20 minutes but I want to talk about this for an hour what is better help? and then let's dive into why this is so relevant and March of 2020 it's already April so better help is the largest online counseling service was wide and started six years ago we have a network of forewords 7000 licensed therapists nationwide and we connect people who are looking for mental health help with one of these licensed therapists based on their needs and preferences, where they can go to a counseling online pretty similar to the one they would have in a brick and mortar but with four options of communication messaging, which is a synchronous, you send a message to your therapist any time you want it to be like e-mail, get a response, usually seeing you day after or you schedule like sessions over phone, video or chat we have around a little over 2 million interactions every month or months in Corona definitely it's anything but usual as people need more, we need more therapy and help given the stress, anxiety and even loneliness with shelter-in-place coming to most states And of course, the inability to actually go to see a therapist in the office if you wanted to OK so way too many questions am I have to go back a little bit now, you're not coming from the therapy world you're not a psychologist and did you even come from healthcare, general, and before? no, not at all how did you get to build this? so I'm coming from a consumer products background of being in this space for 18 years now, of interacting with consumers on marketplaces and different kinds of services and I'm not coming from counseling I'm not coming from health care there's a whole debate about whether farmers should come from the domain from outside of the domain definitely lots of examples, Uber or BMB and you name it, of better health help their verticals and hope that were founded by people who came outside of their domain there are some advantages that leave fresh thinking, usually more line of thought that it's aligned with what consumers want rather than what the system is used to provide, and maybe convenience the system by the traditional way obviously we have therapists on the team and we, all the clinical staff I'm not making any clinical decisions whatsoever, but our concerned from day one was we wanted to create something that people actually wanted people use because instead we argue with therapy and that's not Corona related is, it's a huge deal of a lot of people, but most people actually don't use that so you broke your leg or you coughing today you're going to see a doctor in 90% plus of the cases but most people who struggle with mental health, even very significant struggles, will avoid going to therapy so you have research shows that you have around 25% at any given time, has a serious mental health issue that should be addressed by a professional but at any given time, very few of them would actually go to sleep why? because if it's expensive, it's inaccessible it's inconvenient I experienced this myself when, socially unacceptable sometimes there is a lot of stigma and I experience myself when I thought, you know, maybe in the last days of my previous company for the better health care to be, I want see a therapist and I thought, OK, that's that should be easy it was anything but easy so it's it's really a very, very needed service therapy as a whole that can change people's lives it's really amazing how people's I can change and sometimes pretty quickly, with the help of a true professional that is train in and has the right expertise, but still so few people actually use them so our approach and that may be a different approach by the company, especially the last two, three years, was not to disrupt therapy, not say, oh, we've got to do AI, we're not going to do about it it's a whole different way of therapy, which is the exact opposite approach that we want therapy is a tried and true science that is studied and proved over so many years we're going to give is a, as it is, it's the same therapist that you see in brick and mortar it's the same type of interactions and it goes what we're changing, what we're disrupting is the delivery mechanism so it's the way people communicate with a therapist make it more accessible, more convenient and eventually also more affordable OK, so I'm one of the biggest advocates, I think in the world for four therapy, practicing and myself with a professional and I believe that every person in the world needs to see a therapist because it's having the subjective persona that's able to help you reflect on what you're feeling and believing I think it's just it's a privilege and that that we have and unfortunately, in most people in the world can't afford it or it's not accessible and so what you're doing is amazing, but you're also making a lot of money I'm sure you are millions of, you said 2 million sessions, 2 million sessions a month and I'm guessing I remember that what was the last number that you shared with me and the total number of sessions that were through better help so far, we had around 65 million of messages, video calls, phone calls, insane how do you balance this idea that you're creating a business that is, you know, at the end of it, it's it's a good business it's social good you're helping so many people at the same time you're making money do you find any contradiction there? do is, people challenge you on that sometimes? there's always the notion of, oh, you're making you know, you're making money of people's misery but that's, I think, coming to so many professions from doctors to mechanics Yeah, I can make money when your car breaks and doctors make money when your body breaks and where, that's why people hate insurance companies, right? Yeah, it's, we provide a solution and so I definitely feel comfortable, especially that we make it much more affordable but yes, mental health is a touchy topic, I think and smarter people said it before me that the 4th profit model is when you can make it work is actually what brings the most value to mankind maybe it's a fortune that's the way it is but that's that's reality so if you can make a sustainable business and make good sometime that's perfect But we do recognize that we have you know extra responsibility here, which was why, for example, we have a very extensive financial aid program so if you sign up for a service, if you can't afford that service, we provide financial aid in very serious discounts we keep paying therapists the same as therapies are unaware that even you may be getting financial aid because we think that they should focus under on their job and we subsidize, we give kind of a free service to, you know, when there is a time of nature disaster or in the time of Corona we also give some groups a free or very discounted service so we try to help wherever we can but yes, we're a full profit corporation Yeah we're also need to support the therapies that, I think it's I think it's completely right I mean, I completely agree with that and I I love this this idea of a win win situation and then really creating incentives for both groups to maximize on it and you know I got to start working recently at Hippo Insurance and I get to see firsthand you insurance company and, you know, just the word insurance makes some people vomit but all of a sudden, you're seeing a new type of company come up and really try to think, how can we make their user experience better so that they don't see us as the enemy, but as a friend and I think I'm learning a lot through that experience and I'm really making analogies to what's happening with better help and that's why I also really love what you guys are doing and now, anything that you provide value to the end user, that's something we get every day, sometimes five, sometimes 10 these days, many more than that e-mails from people, I see what you're sharing change or stage of their lives this is really the big joy of coming to work here a lot of companies try to bring value, but when you do that in such a direct way ou actually change something very fundamental in someone's life as someone like that. that's really amazing and that keeps us very motivated every day I mean, Alon, you can literally fill up your whole wall with tweets of better help save my life I see that every day on Facebook, that's done that Really? I don't see that about many companies that term something saved my life you know, something made me happier or something was tasty something helped me enjoy movies better, but something saved my life I think that's pretty special now we're in April where hopefully soon at the peak of Corona and how is this how is this affecting better help? what's happening to the therapy world where now all therapists have to move online, basically so we see several things happening first of all, are existing members the people that's been in therapy with us maybe for months and some of them even years, definitely use a service warning you see that in the data, our model, we mentioned that better models, really, the consumer is paying a flat fee, a monthly fee and with that fee, they can interact with the counselors as much as they like over text and messages as they need and they can have a weekly live session of a fun video chat so it's kind of a flexible model that use the service more or less as need without worrying on the financials of a specific session so we see a lot of people just use the service more Right and we're very happy that we can help them this time we also have an influx of a lot of new members the number of new people that sign up with us and so therapy with us has doubled these February-March to specific people with stress and anxiety, which are things that are relevant to Corona virus double then compared to a February March of last year so that's also destined to to the great in unlike maybe other verticals where you have a problem of the months sucking up supply cannot accommodate that or you have more supply Now that demand in you know artists specifically for this crisis is actually played out pretty well because a lot more people need therapy, but also a lot of therapists are now available to provide more services so we see, firstly we see a lot more patients of therapist who wants to work with us, but also the current therapists are opening their availability more because we have a lot of therapies I just think Better Help have a private practice to work in a school, in an agency and of course, now everything is very different so, yes, we have a lot more demand, but also supply improved significantly so we're we're pretty, pretty in good shape to accommodate an ease of both sides of. Yeah, I mean, you know, every second article that I read is about how tech startups are firing vehemently across the board and then I go on Facebook and Alon Matas we're hiring aggressively please refer to us I think over the last week we hired like six people, in the company of how many? in the company of how many people? at Better Help 70 or maybe I don't know, 75 so you increased by almost 10 % Yeah now everybody is talking percentages Yeah. and we also tried to make it to meet the people who are infected now so for example, one of the maybe bigger startups and so-called I'm sure now a mass layoff last week, we made a webinar a couple days ago with a whole department that just got shut down and offered all of them to start a Fast-Track process because we know an , for me like I want to come across is someone taking advantage of the situation but for all for us, you know, always wanting now you interview someone and they look great and they have all the qualifications and everything you always having at the back of your mind OK, so what? Why do you leave your previous workplace or why were you let go? and that's always kind of a sticking point I need to understand the story here it's actually very simple Yeah, my department got shut down it's a great starting to get company even over hours so is it awesome? I mean, it's it's terrible but they're now they're kicking people looking for a job and the fact is, looking for a job has nothing to do with her performance Yeah. or they could please just situational interesting I kind of assume that they are top performers because they were in their own startup so we'll still make an interview process and we'll make some hiring process but it's a much more faster thing to do with a lot more confidence with your situation so what's going to happen a year from now? A you know, I'm looking at people having weddings over zoom, funerals over zoom and let alone so therapy obviously, what's going to happen in a year with online relationships and communication. you know, I just started planning my eleven year old birthday present today it's a good thing it's not a bar mitzvah. You know, you have a year like day. I don't know, like I don't have a crystal ball thinking a lot of I think and in this week, I don't know when this is going to be in this week. I think there is a some kind of sudden realization that this is not a binary situation where it will just, you know, we're now shut down in the announcement of a moment we'll go back to normal. now people starting to realize that it's going probably going to be a gradual process with a lot of checks and balances and ups and downs and pullbacks and restrictions and that's open and actually opening up a lot of questions of how things are going to look like I don't think, you know, face to face is doomed forever I think we'll definitely go back to that and that's great I think online is but definitely should be the path of a space for some people that feel more comfortable some patients are also best addressed with a space also, refer people in normal times a pretty significant percent, people who sign up to Better Help and tell them actually only counseling is not a great fit for you or your situation, or maybe your severity you should go face to face and we provide referrals and resources so it should definitely be back and should be back but I think a lot of people just like with, you know web conferencing and doing meeting online and working remotely were forced to experience other things and find out that, you know what, that's actually works pretty well better than I expected so I think if if we prove that we can provide the quality of service that people expect and get in traditional format, then it's definitely going to have a long term and impact on the US but are we are we doomed to go full virtual? so I'm thinking about, you know, my generation, the one after me and I mean, if we look at it in 20 years, do you really I mean, I'm looking at you as an expert on virtual relationship, Right, virtual communication and, you know, therapy you could suggest that it's one of the most intimate relationships that you could form with another with a person, let alone a professional and you're showing that it's possible and can still be adequate, well virtual so do you think  that's where we're headed worse at some point we're just gonna take it for granted that everything is virtual and doing this physically will be kind of a weird and out of the norm? twenty years is a long, long time you can look at what happened with retail retailers that only suffered a lot with the rise of online and Amazon and e-retailers, but it still exists in still a huge portion of commerce is done in physical retail I think it's always going to have to have both maybe not in the same proportion we have now and of course, it's up to us to prove that it works in now you know, when we started six years ago, it was a theory and then we started getting feedback from users and counselors but it was always kind of, that's really how the simple equal outcomes over the last couple of years, more and more studies and more and more research started to come specifically following counts to give more specific help with some studies that showed that for some areas, for example, depression, the very clinical outcomes, not how people feel, not what people say The way you can measure their depression symptoms, the improved the reduction in these symptoms is somewhat increasing online counseling with platform like Better Help compared to traditional counseling so as this get more acceptable by people in more back by my research that's definitely going to help you but I'm not I don't think I can actually predict what happens at 20 years from now, but I don't think we're going to be 100% virtual Yeah even in this time Alon before we end, Three words that describe you well, that's the reaction Yeah You should've prepared me for that but then I to get that reaction three words, they has to be three adjectives or, whatever you come up with it's not a commandment three words that you feel now trying my best love it I might adopt that I really like it Alon thank you so much for your time thank you there's a lot of fun Bye bye
