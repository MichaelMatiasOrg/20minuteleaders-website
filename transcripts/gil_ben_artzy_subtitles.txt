1 All right. Gil Ben Artzy, thank you for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Absolutely. Thank you so much for having me. You already told me you're gonna cheat on the last question. So, I'm so excited for this interview because it's gonna be I think different from all the rest. Gil, we know each other for many many years now. Ever since I came to visit you in Palo Alto like six years ago for Anymeal. The diet startup. Gil, give me two, three sentences about Upwest. And what do you guys do? I have an episode with Shuly but it's so amazing that we have to talk about it again. There you go. So, you can compare notes and see if we're doing a job. I want to make sure your consistence. There you go. So, Upwest is an early stage seed fund. We actually invest in both pre-seed and seed stage. And we are tailor-made for Israeli founders that are looking to break into the US market. So, we are focus on investing in Israeli founders and helping them in the early stages of ramping up the team. Getting momentum. Fund raising and so forth, here in the US. We've done it for close to nine years now. We've back over 80 companies that raised over one billion dollars. And follow on financing. First investor in Sente, one which is a Unitcom startup and many other prominent companies that we think of this the few would be the start stage. So, we've been super excited to do this for right now. And yeah, I'm looking for the future ahead. Amazing. So, I always joke with a new founders. That when you start out, that the lifetime of the company is seven to nine years. That's the game you're going in to. So, usually the first for you is you can go a lot more without showing too many returns. Because it takes seven to nine years. But you're there. So, now you have to show returns and obviously you're showing some pretty amazing returns. Or you've shown amazing companies on where they're at now. What is this idea of Israeli’s and Silicon Valley and disintegration and adaptation? So, first of all, I sit eight, nine years in VC is very very young. I'm still learning every day. It's the equivalent of maybe eight, nine months in the startups. So, with been in run for a while. But it takes time, decades. You know, I think Israel always had a very special relationship with the US. But on the tech funds, specifically with the valley, you've seen over the years fantastic companies emerged here. And in the past couple of decades in particular, many fantastic companies, such as house and others have emerged here by a really incredible Israeli founders. And our goal is to level the plain fields for Israeli companies that wanna come here and get the same opportunities that the other founders that are already based here. Amazing. Gil, how many companies, how many decks do you yield a year? We see well over a thousand. We invest in far less than one percent. And that the way we think about it is not about screening them. I mean, we spend a lot of time in Israel and here. And whether its Zoom or in person. Our goal is really also to give feedback. Like we wanna contribute to the journey. Give them some insights about the market. Maybe a few competitors that maybe had not heard about or know, you know or we can add more information about. So, we really help them and advise them because they deserve it. Incredible. I don’t know many people who can talk about their job and say that after nine years of being in the same quote unquote job. They are still learning every day. And it feels like they were only there for eight or nine months. So, already I'm inspired by this passion. Gil, where do you come from? You have a pretty interesting leeway. Yeah. So, Israeli's you're talking right. My first nine years I, I was actually born in Be'er Sheva. When my parents were in their very early 20s and going to universities. So, I was born in Be'er Sheva but I grow up my first nine years in Kfar Saba. We then moved to London. I spend seven years growing up in London. I can feel it in the accent. The accent are definitely my passion for specific music and sports immersed there. What is that passion? What is that music? Well, growing up in London in the 80s, right. You get to touch a certain types of music. And you take it with you. But yeah. I'm definitely carved in new music on a numbering basis. I think that's where it began. Came back to Israel sixteen. Back to Kfar Saba. Did my military service. Wasn’t smart enough to be in 8200. And so for them the oldest of three siblings, the alpha version. The alpha is like goes there. So, my brother and sister did much better than me at schools. But I spend three years in armored corps. Did my undergrad. And at the age of 25, I decided that I want to break into the US market on my own. Right? Not with tech background but I did wanna know that I want to spend some time here. And moved here to do my MBA at Wharton. Worked for BCG in New Yok. And then Yahoo. And here we are. Amazing. And what did you do at Yahoo? I started off in the Corporate Development team. And it was amazing exposure. Got to work with fantastic people and even the founders of Yahoo. Being Israeli, I stand myself to Israel once or twice a year. To see startups. Help them. But also end up acquiring Yahoo's first company in Israel. Helping to open the first hour in the center in Haifa. And it's actually were the seeding of sort of Upwest began when I met Shully in 2006. And we start teaching. Start differences between some of the founders here and some of the founders in Israel that were at least on the same level in terms of their DNA. But maybe didn’t have the same opportunities of those that were already based in the US. Incredible. I mean I was just such a small kid. You're saying Yahoo. That was about 2005, 2006? Started in 2005. And before it’s in CorpDev, then I was in operations. Yes. That time I had my Yahoo mailbox and all my friends had a Yahoo mailbox. It was obviously a different time back then in terms of the market share of companies. But that's incredible. And Gil, you have the unique experience of being a partner in quite a few portfolio companies. How many portfolio companies do you see through now? Over the past nine years? How many have we invested or seen? Yeah. Invested in. That you're a part of. Invested in, 82. 82. Okay. So, you have the unique privilege and a bit challenging role. To come in to this incredibly difficult time over the past three months. You have to help 82 companies or a little less go through this journey of dealing with Covid-19. And you actually have to deal with also with a newborn. Congratulations. Thank you. A beautiful Maya. What is that like? What is your role as the VC partner and helping these portfolio companies push through this? So, first of all it's an individual support. Right? I mean its myself, my partners, but also the other well investors that back the companies. And I think for us it's giving a sanity check to the founders and also helping spread information what others are doing. So, for example in the very beginning. It's really encouraging them to take a close look at the runway. And not be shy in making decisions. Some of them tough about their workforce because there won’t be a procrastinate and say, "You know, we'll have to wait." The more painful it become afterwards. So, it’s having those eyes wide open conversation. Did you have a situation where you pushed a founder to make that difficult decision? And you feel like if you were in a picture they might not have been able to make it? Yeah, I wouldn’t say pushed them. I think maybe pushed them to think about other alternatives. And sometimes it’s not just about us. It's about connecting maybe to other founders. We also brought people that were back in 2008. So, the previous recession and had to overcome that. So, it's not just about what I know, what I think. It's about sort of being sort of their advisor and shepherding them through the process. And do you approach this optimistically, pessimistically, or realistically? What's your position at the dinner table with your founding team? You know there's no pessimist in the world. There's only optimist and realist. Right? I think as a venture capitalist, as a founder you have to have some heavy dose of optimism. Right? It makes no sense to start a company and try to battle this incredible giants and overcome the obstacles. So, you need to have this level of optimism. So, we do go into it. But at the same time you need to plan for the worst. And the worst is you need to have 18, 24 months of runway for example. And not just say, "You know, this will be a V-shape recovery and in three months everything will be fine." You know what? Let's not hope for that’s the case. But let's plan for it not being whatsoever that. Amazing. Gil, what excites you? After nine years thousands of potential dealers. 82 investments. What gets you up in the morning? What are you really really excited about? Lots of things. I don't think I'm one of those investors that says, "This domain. That domain." I think for me it really comes to the people that we meet a coffee shop. On the corner of Rothschild Avenue and something in Tel Aviv. When they only have a gleam in their eyes. And they just started. And it's about trying to see if we can have guide them to come to come to the US and growing their business to become what we think it can become. So, I think it's that optimism, that belief, those early days, the process, the ups, the downs. I think the journey itself is what excites me. Certainly new technologies impact on the world I am completely on board. But its I think being part of the journey of one person against the world, quote unquote that I like being part of. And how would you describe your engagement with them? Some VCs are very hands-off. Take my money and leave. Sort of dumb money. Some of them comes in our offices giving a small hand. But how do you approach this relationship of yours with your portfolio companies at such an early stage? Yeah. Look, I think each investor wants to contribute. I think each investor plays a different role. So, at the very beginning we are almost always the first and only money in the company. So, it's about typically guiding them in the right direction. Avoiding making big mistakes. Helping them make some decision that they rely on. Helping them to find additional investor that can invest. And overtime that evolves. Because now they have different advisors that brings something else to the table. So, for us we have to ask if it's okay. Other reaching out to our position and advice to compliments on the other people that are supporting the CEO and the founders. So, even our world changes over time. Natural. But at the end also. I got to be in the Upwest offices quite a few times at this point. It's practically my second home outside of the Stanford dorms. You walk in and you see five, six different companies sitting in their tables talking to each other. All friends. Everybody's so nice. It's like a hub. It reminds me of the Google campus that was back in Electro Building. You know, a few years ago where you walked and there's this electricity and fire. And it doesn’t look like it’s a VC office. It looks like it’s a workspace where you're not just giving money to the portfolio companies. You're actually giving mentorship and friendship. And a community for them to work together in the heart of Silicon Valley. Which is not away from Tel Aviv. Where they get to be with other Israelis right in the same room. Yeah. Two things about it. You're completely right. First of all the community. Critical workforce. It's about founders going to share their experiences. That actually are pretty unique to them when you think about it. You move to the US. You can move you're significant other with kids. Many of them. That's not easy or whatsoever. So, you share the experiences, both of the companies of your same stage. But also those that came one, two, five years ahead of you. So, we make sure to bring all that to the table. But the second thing is, we absolutely make sure that folks are not alone and sitting within themselves. It's about pushing them out immersing in the ecosystem. Just because the culture of the business here can be at first challenging and not that straightforward to understand. I'm still figuring it out. Right? So, almost couple of decades onwards. So, it's about definitely being out there. It's very to get in to your shell and be with your own folks. But you absolutely have to be out there to succeed. Definitely. Are things changing in the VC world? What's happening? Are things have been the same over the past few decades? Where do you see things going forward? Not just for Upwest but general venture capital relationship with entrepreneurs let's say in the next decade. Yeah. I don’t know if I'm smart enough to sort of see the next decade. But there's definitely in the last 10 years plus have been some definite big changes. I think the definition of venture capital has changed what VCs bring to the table. Many from us have taken in that to add lots of experiences and value ads and various raise. So it's not just the partners in the fund. Funds of all sizes. Right? In the past seed funds. What is a seed fund? Anything below 50 or 100 didn’t make any sense. Now you have super huge earning seed funds. That happened a decade ago. So, began at least really fantastic funds there. Obviously the soft bank phenomena in funds not raising 300 but riparian ends even in a house bill as we saw it. So, things have changed a lot. But the covid hasn’t evolve. Which is trying to get conviction about a team hoping that they get conviction about you. Because you are about to spend seven to 10 years of working together. So, you want this mutual respect exactly. Hopefully mutual respect, mutual ability to work together. So, finding those partnerships founders is not easy. It actually shouldn’t be easy. It's a big decision for both sides. That hasn’t changed. Right. Gil, now I'm talking as an entrepreneur. I get to surround myself with incredible other young entrepreneurs much smarter than me. Both from 8200 and Stanford. I'm just amazed by the things that some of them are doing. And it's very confusing. There's a lot of options. A lot of places to go. How does a young entrepreneur balance their journey. On one hand there's pride and I'm gonna go raise money and I'm gonna finish my culminator and raise the biggest seed right amount that I can raise. On the other hand you have the more conservative approach of, I'm not sure that I need money. I can maybe bootstrap this or maybe I am looking for specific strategic investors. So, how does a young entrepreneur like myself navigate through all this options? And what's the most important thing to keep in mind as I'm building my team? As I'm building my strategy to eventually make a big impact? Good question. So, first of all there's no one way. Right? There’s no one way that treats everything. For young founders, I think it's about surrounding yourself with the right set of advisors, of friends, and experiences that you gather along the way and see what works for you. Sometimes it's about getting you knowledgeable about business that you're super passionate about. And you can make it into a bootstrap. And you can work with it before fundraising if at all. Sometimes you have maybe some technical skills and unique team that you put together. That you really have to raise a meaningful seed to show something meaningful at the early stage. So, there's no one answer. But I think I would encourage everyone especially in Stanford to make those internships count during the day, during the years, during the summer. Make them as diverse as human impossible. Reach out to people. Have coffee chat. Coffee chats. I actually I think as my journey took me here. I spoke to many dozens of venture capitalist before even knowing what that is. And deciding to jump into the deep end. And this is 10 years post MBA. So, I think the full advantage of my person network, my business profession networks, to just talk to people. And see what they say and what they've learned and their experiences. And then figure out the right path for me. And the right path for me was not to join a big VC. But we had the opportunity to start our own [--] bootstrap. Maybe you can believe it at the very beginning. So, that was the answer for us. Does that mean that's the answer for everyone in our profession? No. Sure. Yeah. I know. It seems like there is a growing trend where relationships are not so much about the long term. But its more about what can you offer me today so that I can offer you something tomorrow. Which is just hardening any seal with the competitive nature, I think. Sometimes at my place in Stanford there’s a lot others who are very interested in forming these personal relationships. I value them a lot. And that's why I love doing what we're doing here and getting to know you over these years. And hopefully one day I can be in front of you and I'll be one of the thousands decks that you receive in your mailbox. So, hopefully sooner than later. Gil, last thoughts about where are you headed with this? Do you see yourself continue with Upwest and growing it into a massive VC? Do you see yourself navigating potentially to other areas? What's up with you? So, as much as I can help it and control things. This is the last job I wanna be doing. Right? I have not tried to do anything else. It's a startup. Right? This is a startup. This is a startup? Of course it's a startup. We bootstrap it. We invest money for people. We're trying to grow it to some extent. But that's sort of what we do. Right? I even asked you in the email. I asked you that we might probably talk about being a VC versus you starting a startup. But you actually starting a startup while doing a VC. Yeah. So, and I absolutely treat it that way. I'm going forward. We're doing a scale a little bit. But ultimately what will guide us is we wanna invest in very early stage startups founded by Israelis. Whoever they are. And help them break into the US market. If we raise too much money. It doesn’t make sense to write a pre-seed or seed check. We now have to be a serious at fund which a.) is less fund for me; b.) there's so many better investors. So many better investors than us to do it. So, we wanna specialize in being that first check. And so, we have to right size the fund. So, we can’t raise too much. Right? Gil, three words that best describe you. And now I'm ready for the cheating. So, the cheating is I'm a big fan of hyphens. I will be hyphenating a little bit here. So, on sort of the business side, I aspired to be a trusted advisor. So, that's a hyphenated word. That's what I would like to continue to be and aspire to be and hopefully I can continue protecting that. On a personal level, as you see me sitting in the pink room here. I will take on the description of a simple father. I'm still figuring it out and will likely figure it out for a long time. So, that would be my second word and I didn’t cheat here. That's not hyphenated. I love it. So, looks kind of white. But now I'm making sure that this is a pink room. Gil, you're sitting in your daughter's room. Right? Yeah, light pink room. Exactly. And then the third, I didn’t know what to say. So, I just go with, and this is absolutely hyphenated "proud Kfar Saba". I'm a proud Jew citizen of Israel in the US. That's where I grow up, my roots it's from Kfar Saba. And what that means to me is community, family. And that is where I'm from and where I started. And frankly, all my family, cousins, aunts, about 40 close members of my family all live five minutes from one another. Walking distance. And I'm the only one who isn’t. So, I'm like the black sheep of the family. But yeah, that's what hyphenated values to describe myself. Gil, toda raba. Best of luck. It sounds amazing. And look for my email with the deck in one or two years. Thank you so much. Thank you for having me. Take care.
