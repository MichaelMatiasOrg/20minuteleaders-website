1 Anne Blum, thank you so much for being on my show. How are you? Thank you so much for having me. I'm delighted to be here. I'm great. Six months into quarantine, but still surviving. I can't complain. How are you? So, I'm doing fine. But I see only one plant. And you said you have a hundred plants in your apartment and three trees, right? Yes. This is one of the trees. Most of the plants are downstairs. It's hard to carry them up the stairs. Of course. Of course. In my living room, I've basically turned it into a greenhouse During quarantine, I've had a lot of free time. So, I've been doing gardening indoors because I don't have any outdoor space, unfortunately. And also painting. I love it. I love it. Okay. So, I've been hearing that a lot. A lot of people have been taking up botanics and gardening lately. So, it's definitely very interesting. I figure if you can't go outside, might as well bring the outside in. 100%. 100%. So, Anne, I mean, it's a really fascinating journey that you've had. And I'm very excited to hear about the insights that you've gained along the years from running two accelerators in New York. One of them the German accelerator, another one Ellis. Moving on to early stage venture capital helping European and Israeli startups break into the US market with Angular ventures as the head of platform. But you started out in corporate. You started out in mobile developer outreach for Facebook, right? Well, actually, my first job ever after college was at Goldman. As HR. Yeah, HR. So, that was a great start. I really enjoyed starting my career at a large company, especially Goldman. It's a fantastic life's work and I got to meet and work with some really incredible smart people. 100%. So, I have to ask the German accelerator. Like I mentioned, I was looking forever for what is the name of the German accelerator. And you just helped me clarify a second ago. But please clarify for everybody watching this. So, the German accelerators the name is German accelerator. Which is probably the most German way to come up with an accelerator name. You have no idea how many times when I worked there, people would be like, "What's the name of the German accelerator?" I'm like, "The German accelerator." I'm sure. I'm sure. So, it's always like it's capital now. It works with title [--] and thought through it. The program is doing quite well. Whatever makes people talk about it the more obviously works. But you're not from Germany. You're from France originally, right? So, my dad's American. He's a Jew from the Bronx. And then, my mom was from Paris. So, I basically spent, I was born in London, then lived in Paris for a bit. And when I was three, I moved to New York. Still spending my summers in France, typically in Paris or the south, specifically Basque Country. And then in New York, I grew up in Westchester. I went to the French American school. So, I still speak French and try to keep that connection alive. But I'm very Americanized in my culture. No. I don't speak German, not German at all. Fortunately, that wasn't a prerequisite to working at the German accelerator. How do you go from HR at Goldman Sachs to mobile developer outreach at Facebook to running two accelerators at the same time in New York? It's a great question. I would love to say that I had this big grand plan for my career. I'll do this too and then I'll do that. No. Not at all. This is not planned. It just happened. And don't get me wrong, I'm very happy with the outcome of it. But the mindset I had when I started my career was, or at least my first job at Goldman was I love this, this is fantastic, I'm supporting. Basically my role there was in learning and development and helping the 9,000 plus engineers that worked at Goldman know everything they needed to know from technical side, all the way to soft skills. And I was there for about a year and a half. And I thought I was going to be a lifer. Like, I really jive with the corporate culture. My dad had worked there for a long time. And I think especially, coming straight from college, being in a part of the whole, like most classes and training programs. It is just a lot of fun. And then, I knew ultimately I didn't want to be in HR long term. It just wasn't exactly, I really enjoyed it but I knew that I didn't want to make a career in that. Now, when you say HR, just to clarify, because there's a lot of different facets in HR, so what specifically were you working on within Goldman Sachs? So, learning and development. And I was specifically on the Goldman Sachs University at technology training. So that I was very lucky and that I was placed on the tech team. Because you get accepted and then you go to Goldman Sachs University and they have different teams aligned to the different divisions. And most people wanted to be on the IT team or security is like the sexy teams. And I was like, they put me on tech. This is like I find interesting, I want to be with my techies. And back then, I think, especially in New York, Tech was cool. And I was very lucky that I got this my team. I got to meet a ton of really great engineers and work with them. And also happened to fall into this tech world, which I fell in love with. And after working with engineers for a while, I realized, Okay, if I'm really meant into this tech scene, how can I get more into this. And the logical conclusion was go to a tech company. And one of my best friends from Cornell, she was at Facebook working on the FB startup program. So, she pulled me in. It happened very quickly. And I joined at the end of 2015. And it was an amazing experience. I mean it was a very small team. We were three people and we were running a program with at the time over 12,000 startups all around the world. So, it was a very much scaled program. But we were able to support them in a scaled manner to events all around the world, give them benefits, mentorship from Facebook, community, etc. So, you're saying that there wasn't this grand plan, but I do see a pattern. I am working on a pattern here that you're starting out in finance, but you're gravitating towards tech and then you find yourself helping 12,000 startups within Facebook. So, it is now very logical as to how you went to create two accelerators and then you end up helping leverage the portfolio companies for an early stage venture capital fund like Angular Ventures. Absolutely. So, I will say that when I was still in school and I didn't know what I want to do, I just knew that I wanted to have a positive impact, whatever it was that I was doing. And then fell into the tech world and then ended up working with startups at Facebook. And that's when I knew, Okay, I fell in love with startup Game and this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. To be supporting startups, hopefully helping them achieve their goals. And ideally, I would love to be involved with building the next Google or other big tech company. Right. And it was a really awesome experience, I think, especially being in Silicon Valley I moved there in 2015, Facebook was growing incredibly quickly at the time. There is nothing quite like it. I will say from a social perspective, moving from downtown Manhattan to Menlo Park, it was like it. I'm sure. It was a bit of a change. But it was an incredibly exciting experience and one that I was very fortunate to be a part of. And I was on the platform partnerships team. And the thing with Facebook is things change really quickly from one day to the next. So, after about a year and a half working there, I knew that I wanted to come back to the East Coast. Most of my family and friends are here. And I also saw that the New York City tech scene was starting to really come into its own. And I wanted to be a part of that because there's something here and I miss the New York energy. And there's something really special about New York, so, I came back. And I did something it's like I feel like most people would discourage doing it, but I thought it was fantastic, is after working at Goldman and Facebook, I was tired. Both were very intense jobs, working late night every night, working almost weekends. And I was like, "I need a break." So, you go and you ran two accelerator at the same time. It makes sense. Well, before that, I took six months off to travel the world. I went to Israel for the first time, which is amazing. And I went to a bunch of other places. And I thought like being somewhat of a workaholic. I thought I would be so bored during my time off and that was not at all the case. I was happy until it last. I was like, I could do this for a couple of years. This is great. A couple of years. Then you throw yourself again into this environment. I'd love to understand a little bit better about your insights from running those two accelerators. Specifically this whole notion of breaking into the US market. I think it's something that's extremely fascinating both for startups that are starting out in the US market, but also for a lot of my friends around Europe and Israel who are running their companies. A lot of them are considering when to relocate. I'm very very good friends with Shuly and Gil from UpWest and Yair, a guy from Fusion LA, and so there's a lot of talk about how to help outside companies break into the US market. And I'd love to hear a little bit about your insight from doing that, both from the accelerator and then we'll transition also into your  work with Angular Ventures. Of course. Yeah. So, when I came back to New York, I started working at the German accelerator. And that program was about bringing German startups to the US market. I think that Germany was ahead of the game. There is actually a program sponsored by the German government. So, it's great for the startups. Zero equity, zero fees. Yeah. Which is very special. And I think Germany rightfully realized that the way to long term grow their economy was really investing in their startups. And a big part of that investment is helping them come to the US. I think that this is something that's especially true for companies that are B2B, especially enterprise. Just because so many of the largest companies are based in the US. And being able to meet with them and get their feedback and bring them on as design partners is so vitally important. So, that program, I ran that program as a program manager for two years. And then, also saw that there was a big appetite for startups who wanted to come to the US from other parts of the world. I know Israel that's been so ingrained in the Israeli ecosystem for so long that for Israelis, it's like obviously, this is a no brainer. But for a lot of other countries, it was less obvious. I think, too, for startups let's say from France or from Italy or Germany, there can be that fallacy of like, my market is big enough, right? I can go to the top French companies and grow it through there. But ultimately, you tap out of your market really quickly. And by the time you're like, okay, I conquer the French market now it's time to go to the US, you could have a competitor here that's already taken over the market and you might be put at a serious disadvantage. So, we saw that there was this need. So, I co-founded Ellis Accelerator and we ran three different cohorts through that program. And that was all about bringing companies from all around the world to the US. And it worked pretty well. I'd say that the biggest reasons for startups to think about coming to the US and obviously things, the way you do that now with covid is a bit different than the way you did it before. But the reasons are still fundamentally the same sales acceleration. So, we've actually done a bit of research and for more than 80% of startups that come to the US, their sales drastically increased after. Really? 80%? 83%. Yes. 83%. That's wow. Yeah. And then also, it's much easier to fundraise, right? There is a lot of investors in the US, there's a lot of money flowing. And so, for about 40% of the startups that came here, they had an easier process fundraising. But I do have to ask, Anne, because obviously there is this the mindset shift is a challenge on its own, right? So, providing that accessibility into the American mindset and actually making that move of transitioning the business towards the US market, but what other challenges did you notice? Whether it's through the German accelerator or else, what are some of the common challenges that the companies or early stage companies face as they come to the US? And they're saying like, wow, this is something either we didn't expect or, wow this is like a hurdle that we're facing along with a lot of other newcomers here. I think there's a lot of challenges. Some of them are foreseen some of them are not. I would say an interesting thing, especially I'm based in New York, a lot of founders they come here and they're just blown away by how expensive everything is, right? It's like you come here, [--] everything is expensive. And so, I would say going into it, be prepared to make an investment because there will be a lot of upfront costs. So, that's one thing. It's a big investment just from a time perspective and also a capital perspective. I would say managing the culture is quite difficult when you now have a team in the US, in Israel. Time makes it challenging to me when you're hiring American employees, the culture, there can be some clash where people, you both speak in English but you may still not be able to understand what the other person is saying implicitly. And then I would say to another track that a lot of startups I see fall into is hiring the wrong people. You see this especially with sales people. American sales people are really good at selling themselves. And especially for someone coming from outside the US, that you hear them and they talk about their sales experience and it's like, it's perfect. This person is going to grow our sales funnel tremendously. And then a couple months down the line, it doesn't work. I would honestly say that most times, the initial sales people don't end up working out. So, the advice I'd give there is be very very careful who you bring on to the team. Hire slow and if they don't work out, like if you're even thinking about letting someone go, then go. Right. Hire slow, fire fast. Exactly. And I think that holds true both domestically and when you're in the US. But especially because salaries are more expensive here. It can be very costly to keep someone on if they're not bringing in real revenue. 100%. 100% And I want to make sure we also have enough time to talk about Angular Ventures because I think that being head of platform for an early stage fund, the mission is very clear. And it's something that I really resonate to an it's not too far off from what you were doing with the two other accelerator's. But now you're doing it with the head of the VC and you're doing it with portfolio companies that you have a stake in, right? So, it's no longer just companies that are coming in and they're asking for your help, but you actually, you have a stake in the game. Talk to me a little bit about what Angular Ventures is and what is your specific role within that fund that is bridging the gap between basically the whole world? Absolutely. So, basically, Angular Ventures is an early stage fund that invests in startups from Europe and Israel. We typically do checks from anywhere from 200,000 to 1.5 million. We do lead, we do follow on. Our focus is deep tech enterprise. About half of our portfolio currently is Israeli based or Israeli founders, and the other half is spread out throughout Europe. And I met Gil Dibner, the partner of the fund, about a year before the fund officially closed for fund one. And I was always intrigued by venture capital. I wasn't necessarily pursuing it because I was happy in the accelerator world. But I was really interested with what Gil was doing. His track record is really impressive, having four out of 30 investments that he's made have become unicorns. And then the idea of working in, because the downside with working in the accelerator world is you're working with these companies super intensely for three months. And then, it's like little birds. they fly away and they go do their own thing. And yeah, you obviously still keep in touch. But it's not the same level of work. Whereas in the VC world, and this was something that really appealed to me is that you can have this long term relationship with these founders, at the end and at the absolute earliest stage, we'll do checks with someone with just an idea. We like getting in very very early and help them build their company from the ground up. And then work with them for 10 years plus maybe. And so, that was incredibly appealing to me. And then also the idea, having founded my own company before. I love the idea of being the first platform hire and building the platform up from the ground up. And fortunately, I would say that Gil, the partner of the fund, he is very dedicated to working with the portfolio companies as well. So, he spends about half his time working with existing companies and the other half obviously, working on a deal flow and evaluating the opportunities. Of course that shifts with the covid epidemic, I'm sorry, the covid pandemic. Like many other VC's we were primarily focused on our own portfolio even though we were still doing deals actively. But just making sure that the portfolio will survive and thrive during this time. Of course. So, we've built some few really exciting things on the platform side. Ultimately, our goal is to be supportive of our founders and their startups and ensure that they have all the resources and connections they need in order to be successful. So, I would say some of the most more interesting or impactful things that we offer the portfolio companies are we have about a dozen advisory partners, which include the two unicorn founders from JFrog and SiSense. And we also have subject matter experts from branding, marketing, sales, etc. So, whenever any of our portfolio companies have a need on one of these key areas we'll pair them with these advisory partners and then they work long-term together. So, oftentimes working together for a year or more. So, it's a really deep relationship. We also want to focus on things that really move the needle and especially working with enterprise startups. The contract sizes for customers can be so big that if we can help them get one new client, we've done our job. So, we do focus a lot on bridging the corporates in our network with these portfolio companies in order to see if there is any possibility for design partnerships or for the corporates potential to become customers ultimately. We've done a few really interesting research reports. So, at the start of the pandemic, we looked at how covid was impacting startups from, how many of them were changing their product to doing layoffs. So, what exactly were the startup founders thinking of throughout this time. We just released last week a report on enterprise deep tech VC in Europe and Israel. So, if anyone's interested in reading that, it's up on Medium. Definitely encouraged you to check it out. And then we're right now working with Index Ventures, specifically talking or looking at how Israeli startups can successfully expand to the US market, which is, of course, top of mind for a lot of founders. 100%. So, before we end, I have to go back and look at your journey a little bit more realistically, because you've gone through so many different experiences. A lot of them are in the same line of thought of how do we work with early stage companies to either help them break into the US market or continue to scale and grow. And I'd love to hear from you some of the insights that you've gained throughout the years. If you were to look back and talk to a young entrepreneur or a young person that's going into the tech scene or any scene, what are some key things that they should keep in mind as they go on their career path? So, basically, what are some creatives? Right. Okay. I have quite a few ideas. A lot of these I had to learn the hard way. And now I get to hear them the easy way. So, if this helps one person, hopefully it's worth what the trials and tribulations I went through. So, I would say I have five tips for people who are in their career and that for me have been quite valuable. So, the first is storytelling. Everything at the end of the day is about how you can create an interesting and compelling story. Whether you're in college trying to land a job, you have to create a good story about why what you've done in the past is relevant for the company and why you're value added to the specific company. Whether you're a founder, that's creating a story about why an investor should invest in your specific company. I think storytelling is really important. For me and my career, I use storytelling when I was pivoting out of HR and went to Facebook. And the way that I focused on it was rather than focusing on the fact that I was an HR, it was like, no, I was running programming for tech. Which is very relevant to running a startup program at Facebook. And then I would say another thing that's really important is very few things are worth being the hill to die on. I've been guilty of this. What does that mean? Yeah. So, basically what that means is don't ruin professional relationships trying to prove your point, right? I've been guilty of this at times, especially early on in my career, where it's like you know the right answer or you think you know the right answer and you really want to make sure the team or your company does it that way. And it can definitely backfire on you if you're really holding steady on this. So, what I do now is say my thoughts and what I think we should do. And if leadership wants to do it, awesome, if not, fine. Just not getting as personally invested. I will caveat that by saying there are some things which are worth being the hill to die on. I've personally encountered one of them and it was literally, "If we don't do this, I will walk away from the company." Like that. So, it does happen occasionally, but I think ultimately be very mindful of not ruining your relationships. Because your teammates, you have to work with them. This project is going to be over at some point soon. But the teammates, if you're working at this company for years, you have to continue working with them. So, I think it's really important to have positive relationships with them. I have to say regarding that point, it's so interesting. I remember, I often reflect back to my officers academy training, and I remember that one of my commanders there, she give us a talk about our values and the things that we are really passionate about. And especially in a military setting, it's often a very interesting balance between the things that you believe in, the things that the system believes in, at the end, you know your role within an organization. And it's perhaps it's accelerated within a military organization because the thing you're working towards is different than just monetary value for the company. But one of the things she told us is that, you really have one chance within an organization to choose something that is worth fighting for, Enough that you're saying, "I'm putting my keys down and if this is not happening, I'm walking away." But you only get to do that once, really. Because the second time, and the third time is it doesn't really work. So, I definitely, I haven't used that card yet in any organization. But I definitely see. Anne, 20 minutes go by so fast and obviously, there are so many more things that I can learn from. But before we leave, I have to ask you for three words that you would use to describe yourself. Yeah, absolutely. So, I would say if I had to use three words to describe myself, the first is being determined. So, if I got an idea in my head, whether it's work or in my personal life, it will happen. Like come hell or high water, I will make it happen. And so that's it. Career wise, it's been pretty helpful. And then I would say, I tend to be pretty resilient. There's been a number of times where I had to face things that are pretty challenging. The few times where I had to completely start from scratch. When I moved back to New York after leaving Facebook I didn't have an apartment, I was staying at my friend's place, I didn't have a job, so completely rebuilding my life from scratch. I think it takes a lot of resiliency to do that and do it well. And I think a lot of people right now, everyone needs to be resilient going through what we're going through and managing and then doing it so successfully. So, I think that that's a really important skill to have. And then lastly, I would say kindness. There's that famous line that goes, nice guys finish last. And I think that is absolutely not true. I think in the short term, being Machiavellian can pay off. But long term, it 100% does not pay off because people will learn that about you and then they just will not want to work with you. So, I think being kind both personal life and professional life is 100% the right way. And it's worked really well for me. Anne, thank you very very much. Thanks for being so generous with your time and for all the inspiration and insights through all of this. It was really wonderful. I had a great time. Thank you so much for having me. This is an absolute pleasure. Of course. Take care. Stay safe and healthy. Bye.
