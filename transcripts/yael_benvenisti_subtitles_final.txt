1 Yael Benvenisti, thank you for being on my show. How are you? I'm fine, thank you. Really great to have you here. I'm gonna learn about aging in the next 20 minutes. You're an expert in the longetivity space. You're actually named both in 2019 and 2020 one of Israel's top influencers and experts in the longetivity space. The CEO of Mediterranean Towers Ventures, but you're also running a private clinic. And you mentioned that that's leftovers from the first degree, so I'll have to understand a little bit why. But Yael, we have to start with the fun fact because who doesn't like chocolate? What? Me. I hate chocolate. I think I'm unique in that space but really I cannot eat it. It's like somebody saying that they don't like music. I know, but really if you want to surprise me, please do not bring chocolate. Bring flowers, ... I love it. Okay. Yael, first of all, before we even dive deep into your personal journey, give me a little bit of background as to what is the longetivity space? What is this thing called Aging2.0 that you're so passionate about? Okay, well we all know that the world is getting older. If we are looking at what is happening now, there are around 12% of the population that are 60 and above. If we're looking at the year 2030, there will be 16% of the population that are 60 and above. And in the year 2050, there will be more than 20%. That means that every fifth person in the world is going to be older adult. And this changes our whole society. And this opens a huge market and opportunity for innovation. And if we, as a society, want to continue and provide services to a growing population, and still we have a limit in our budget, there's no other solution than to develop technologies. So, I think this is the only way that we should go. We should really implant technologies in our services, in our life in order to have quality of life and not just live longer. So you're saying that in the next dozen years, we're gonna see that one in five people in the world are going to be elderly, and that's a fantastic case as to why we need to continue innovating and put at least, I'm imagining, a fifth of our innovative efforts on the elderly population, if not more because a lot of the times they need more assistance, right, than the younger generation. Yet, if I look at the landscape of startups and of innovations that are happening today, I don't think a fifth of them are dealing with the longetivity space. Is that right? That's right. It feels like there a shortage. Yes, because I think the demographic change begin just now, because the baby boomers, the ones that were born after World War II, they are just now entering what we are called being older adult. So we just, I think in the four, three years, we can see the change that is developing. And we can see the big companies are trying to enter the market. We can see Apple Watch, that is, it's a senior Apple Watch. We can see Amazon, we can see Best Buy, all of them are opening departments for technologies or products for the elderly. We will see the change this period, the covid-19 period, had done really big things with elderly and how we approach elderly. And this is not only about being vulnerable or someone that is being fraud, it's all about having a good life, opportunities, being active in society and what will happen now if I have to stay at home because it's too dangerous outside. How do I continue my life, my activities. And technology is the answer. So Yael, give me a little bit of background as to what needs to happen in the longetivity space. So, in order for us to accommodate for the growing elderly population and to be able to help improving their lives as well, what spaces within the longetivity space do we need to focus on? Is it health care? Is it loneliness? Is it communication? What do you think? Well Aging2.0 which is organization, it's an international organization, based in San Francisco but it has, I think, almost 150 ambassadors all over the world. We are the Israeli ambassadors. They define eight segments in which we can see technologies for aging well. The first one is engagement and purpose. The second one is financial wellness, mobility and movement, daily living and lifestyle, caregiving or care coordination, brain health and the end of life. In each segment, we can see a various of technologies like virtual reality, augmented reality, robots, IOT, artificial intelligence, machine learning. The type of technology is not important; it is the space that they are connected with. And if we will invest in those area, we will see individual well-being and well health. We can see workforce participation, because people will be able to work longer. We will see a raise in the consumption because people will buy more things, so they will continue and develop the economic of the country. We will see a lot of innovation because this is an empty space. It just begin in these activities. So by the way, Yael, out of those eight segments that you were talking about, which one are you most attracted to? Because I could make a very strong case as to why you should be passionate about all of them, but what really gets you excited? I think that continue your lifestyle and daily living will make the the biggest change in our life. So, can you clarify? Does that mean that people will not stop living the way that they are living just because they're getting older and they're having more challenges because of their physiology? This is exactly what I'm saying. It doesn't matter if you cannot leave your home, if you have some disability; you will continue your favorite lifestyle, you will continue to be active in your community, in your family, do what you like to do. Even if you will stay at your home, that doesn't mean that you will not have a community to be engaged in or friends or family or doing whatever you want. Learning something new. Right. But I'm thinking still, Yael, today. The past 20 years, we've had such a boom in consumer technology and things that are helping us live our lives better, yet even my own grandparents, who are 85, and they have a phone and everything, there's still no technology that is helping us communicate better and is helping ... between the generation gaps. You know I'm thinking about my six year old niece and my 85 year old grandmother, they love talking to each other. And it's getting, I can just imagine that if they will be disconnected geographically, it'll be nearly impossible to bridge that communication gap. So why even today isn't there any practical solutions for these, because the market is already here? Well there is, but there is a lack of knowledge. There is a lack of knowledge at your side, as a family member, and a lack of knowledge in your grandmother or grandfather side. So, we are doing what we can in order to spread the ... but it's hard. I personally have a segment in one of the commercial TV channels, in one of the morning shows. So, I'm trying to spread the ... that there are solutions, there are wonderful solution, even for people that are not technologists at all. They don't know how to operate Zoom, they don't know how to push a button, they don't know how to operate the WhatsApp video. There is a technology using the TV screen or even just using a regular screen that is not a TV, that when you schedule in an hour, the video conversation will be open. The person just had to sit in front the screen and that's it. - I love it That's all it is. ... and the cost is so low, really. It cost around one dollar a day. It's nothing, but people do not know. So we have work to do. Definitely. I actually, I participated in a hackathon here in Palo Alto at Y Combinator a few months ago with my friends from Stanford. And we developed this app where we put a camera on the TV, and when the grandchild calls their grandfather a grandmother on the phone, it shows on their TV. And then all the elderly person has to do is wave in front of the camera and it'll open, more for the accessibility side, but we were still shocked that the number of solutions, even if a few do exist, it's still very limited. But Yael, I'd love to learn a little bit more about what you're doing specifically with Mediterranean Towers Ventures, and how specifically you got into this. Because you're very young. You can be doing anything else ... doing venture capital, yet you're excited about the longetivity space, and I have to really understand why. Well, it all started years ago. I was a young physiotherapist working one of the HMOs. And my grandma was a resident in one of the nursing homes in my hometown. And one night the staff, they didn't close the bars of the beds properly. And the bars fell down and she rolled over and she hit her head in the bleacher that was standing near the bed. And she died from a brain hemorrhage. - Oh no So at that point, I made the decision that this will never happen again. I quit my job. I went to learn rehabilitation and geriatrics and start working in rehabilitation centers and in nursing homes with elderly people. And I just loved it. And I continue looking for solutions that these sort of things will never happen again. And then I joined the society, the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Society in Israel. They opened a new group, Technologies for Aging Well. And I was elected as the chairman. We started 14 people around one table. Didn't know what to do. Now we are more than 1,500 members. So, we are very proud. We have a very nice ecosystem. Very active. Yes. So, you were elected chairman to the organization, to the society. Yes. And we started as 14 people around one table, and we really didn't know what to do. And now, we are more than 1,500 members. A very active ecosystem. We are very proud. We joined Aging2.0 that is international organization. And two years ago, two and a half years ago, Mediterranean Towers Venture, which is a publicly traded company, they came to one of our conference and they said that they want to open a CVC, corporate venture capital, and invest in technologies for aging well. Mediterranean Towers Group is a company that is running independent living facilities in Israel. It's the biggest private independent ... facilities in Israel. And we opened the fund. This is the only venture capital in Israel that invest in this space. We are very proud. - Wow. And we open, even if we don't invest in a company, we open our facilities for focus group or for beta testing, and we try really to give a push to the whole ecosystem in Israel. Right. It sounds like it's beyond just another venture capital firm. This is, it's a mission driven fund that is about the community and about fostering an innovative community in the startup nation to help, also motivate, more people to create companies in this space. So, even if you don't invest you're actually helping them continue to grow and develop the relationship with them. It's not just a financial transaction. It's much more about a community, right? Right. Each year we're doing a competition. And our judges is not just a panelist of experts, it's also our residents. They get a chance to vote and they get a chance to ask the entrepreneurs all the questions. And they're really doing a great job. It's not easy to stand on the stage and to answer their questions, because they have very good questions. And we are very proud that they really are active and they shape the next generation of products for the elderly generation. So, putting on the investment hat, are the returns in this space the same as in other spaces like cybersecurity and other consumer technologies? Like what are the differences between the longetivity space and investing exclusively or primarily in the longetivity space rather than other funds that may be focusing on other industries? Well first of all, we are focused in the space and not in the technology. So, I think we are very young space, so the number of exits are really small. But we can see the trend. We can see that all these technologies are raising. When I think two years ago we saw most of the companies raising seed money. Now we can see they passed A-round and they are continue to developing. Ours, we made three investments, all of them are now passed A-rounds. So, we are very proud. And it's only two years ago, so it happens fast. - Wonderful We can see the trend. We can see the really the potential in this area. It's like FinTech five years ago. You have to be patient. No, no I love it. Yeah. but it will happen, definitely it will happen. So Yael, for myself and for my friends who are watching this, we're also considering what to start their next venture, and as we know, especially in Israel, it is very common out of the intelligence unit to go more into the cybersecurity spaces and those types of fields. But I'd love to hear a few ideas just to get the juices running for young entrepreneurs that are thinking of what to do next. And I want to understand really what are the opportunities in this space. And maybe you can give me two or three high level ideas of problems that one can tackle in the aging and longetivity space using technology. Well first of all, when we are talking about technologies for aging well, we are talking about a platform that will combine several services, because we cannot put a lot of devices in your house and use them at the same time. It's too complicated, and it's too expensive. So you have to build a platform that will give a service service, and the service must solve some need. Cybersecurity is nice, but it doesn't solve a problem for me as an individual. But as an older adult that wants to continue and live his life like he used to do, it must solve a problem, some need. This is a very big difference. And I think that every entrepreneur that is entering the space must think about who is the customer and who is the payer. It's not the same person most of the time. Right. Right. And it's a little bit complicated. But if I'm comparing this to the younger generation, you must understand that the product that you are selling for a three years old child is not the same product that you will sell for a 16 years old child. This is the same as the older adult population; you cannot sell the same product for a 65 years old person or to a 90 year old person. This is a huge population, a lot of segmentation, inner segmentation, especially the ability to perform your activity, how activity you are. You have to do a good segmentation of the population and know who is your customer, what you are selling, and who will want to pay for it. I think that's fascinating. And I've been thinking quite a bit about this space, and one of the things that really intrigued me is that this space, more so than a lot of others, like you said, a lot of times the person who is using your product is not necessarily the person who's buying the product. So you have almost like a two sided marketplace and you have to really understand who are the moving players in this puzzle. But it's really, really fascinating. Yael, so I understand the passion that you're coming in doing this. Do you see yourself staying in this space for a long time? I know that you also are still practicing from your original profession out of a love for that profession, but do you see yourself continuing with that mission for many years to come? Or is this something that you're saying, I want to make a dent now and potentially later I'll move on to different industries? No, I will say in this industry it has a huge potential. I saw more than 250 companies in three years. I see the activity. I have a lot of knowledge today that I didn't have four years ago. I want to give it to our entrepreneurs and really to put Israel as the leading country for AgeTech in the world. I love it. Okay, and on that note Yael, I need three words that you would use to describe yourself, and I need you to explain a little bit about these words. Well, I'm a perfectionist person. I love perfection, really. I have to learn about everything and to understand it until I make a decision. I live a good life, really. I'm having a good life. I love coming to my work. I'm coming every day with passion, I see a lot of new things, and I feel that I can contribute to the space. And the last word is a blonde ... the color. I'm not a neutral tone. I love it. Yes. And it's really fun because when people see me, they know my degree, that I have a PhD in geriatrics, and when I come to a conference or to a meeting, they say, "Wow. You?" I said, "Yes. I'm shaping my future. I'm doing it for me. My future will look different" Well your future, but it sounds like you're also in the process of helping millions if not billions of others down the line. So, shaping your future while shaping everybody else's future as well. Yael, thank you very, very much for the inspiration. This was wonderful. I'm personally very passionate about this space that you're in, and that's why I was so excited when you agreed to do this episode with me. And I hope that I'll definitely take an active part in this space, and I hope that my friends, both at Stanford and 8200, will also consider this as a viable path in their entrepreneurship journey. And thank you for all the insights over the past 20 minutes. Thank you. Take care. Bye.
