Wonderful. Okay. Awesome. Okay. We're back. We're back in business, the same place. Ilan, what are the earned secrets that over these 20 years, if you go back 20 years, what would you tell a young Ilan? With regards to enterprise software, it's really important to focus on the end users. This is something that we didn't know 20 years ago. It's maybe a little bit more obvious now, but that's something that's critically important. I think what's more relevant now, which is interesting, is that everyone seems to know that enterprise software also has to be designed well and adoption metrics have to be taken into consideration, but we have seemed to forget the fact that enterprise software still has something different from consumer which is, enterprise software has a user and a chooser. And it is important. The chooser is the person who makes the budget decisions, the person who makes the buying decisions. And it's important to consider them in product management just as much as the end user. Why is that? So in my mind, I have a sales cycle. I go to the enterprise. I pitch to the director who has the authority to sign of on a hundred thousand dollar license. And but the users are the team players who at the end are the ones running around and using my software for whatever they're doing. Right. So the dynamic is that this day, enterprise software is more coming up, sorry bottom up, rather than top down. So rather than CIO making a decision and saying, "Everyone is gonna use this." Enterprise software is actually being found by those ICs, those individual contributors that have the jobs and they want to be more productive at work. They are looking for tools to make them more productive at work. So that's why it's important to focus on the end user but, and at a lot of enterprise software companies, of course, like Slack, are doing so. But it's important at the same time, one of the things that people maybe don't realize about Slack is that we focus equally on the top down. What is gonna be important for the enterprise buyer. And for Slack and for productivity tools specifically, that is productivity and innovation. What are the tools that are gonna help my employees transform themselves to be more productive, to be more innovative. So just going back to that, because it's fascinating to me. What you're saying is that there has been a trend changing that if previously you go to the ICO of the company, the CIO, and you go and you pitch a product and you get them to buy into it and then from top down they disseminate it into their thousand employees or so. Today, you're going after the team players and if they love your product, they'll start adopting it throughout the organization until there's no point but to actually get it custom for the organization, right? That's right. That's right. And then it bubbles up into the CIO. The CIO sees it. It's known maybe as shadow IT at this point. And now you want to you as an enterprise software company you want to sell to the CIO. This is when the CIO is gonna look for different things. Their requirements are very very different from the end users. Certainly they want their end users to be productive, but they also have to look after beyond cost, they have to look after compliance, security, administration, performance. Those are the things that really matter to them when they're shopping for software. So you have to make sure that your product also addresses these needs. Fascinating. So, it sounds to me like you're almost developing two products because even, let's look at Slack as a collaboration tool, on one hand you have the end user, which is myself I love sharing my files. I love all the marketplace with integrations. My life is nothing like it was five years ago. If I had Slack in high school, my high school would look extremely different than it does now because now, it's incredible. I'll just say that it's incredible. But, there's all of this compliance and security that I'm not even aware of. For example, I work at Hippo and I don't really know what security goes behind the scenes to make sure that the data that I pass along is secured but I'm sure that my CIO knows it very well, right? Right. Exactly. That's incredible. That's exactly right. And early on in Slack, we actually did that. We actually, and I've spoken to many enterprise software companies that are starting up and given this advice is that early on we actually separated out product management into self-service and into enterprise. And the self-service part of product management really focused on metrics like adoption, usage of different features, NPS, and satisfaction of end users, the love of the product and all that. In the enterprise side, the side that I led, focused exclusively on making sure that new industries, new geographies, can actually obtain this software. Each one has a different set of compliance requirements, security requirements, administration requirements. So, that's how we looked at the market in a very different lens. But Ilan, your colleague has the luxury of having data from millions of users, getting NPS scores through logic, through the usage. You're coming in and you have a handful of large customers that you're trying to get information from. How do you get an NPS score from those individuals who are buying the software? Because every product class that I ever ... they told us, "Your customers don't know what they want. Ask them what they need." Right? So how do you go about that because your metric is their satisfaction? Yeah, that's right. So, by the way, that phrase that you just quoted has many times been misconstrued especially recently, and I want to make sure that people listening to this that are starting enterprise software companies, understand that, yes, that is true that customers don't necessarily know the solution. They will ask for something that sounds like the solution, but what you need to do as a good PM is to bring them back to the problem. State the problem, and then your job is to come up with the solution. But a lot of people misinterpret that statement that you had to "The customers don't know what they want. I know better what they want. I will go and build something without talking to them." That is not the right strategy and will not work. So the answer to your question, it's a really good question. With enterprise software, it's different. You can't do a broad survey. So quant work is not gonna really work because you just don't have that many data points. Exactly. But you can certainly go and talk to people. So the first thing that I recommend for enterprise software company product managers to do is to set up a CAB, a customer advisory board. Bring in your top 20 customers, meet with them on a regular basis, once every quarter, once every six months, whatever makes sense for you. Present to them. What we do with our CABs, and what we've done since really four years ago when I joined Slack, is we meet regularly. We present the road map and get their feedback on what we are showing. We have special sections. The next section of the CAB, it's a one day session usually. The next session is really to talk about three different drill-down areas, areas that we're planning on invest in recently or in the near future and we really want to get their input on. So drill-downs into specifics. And then the last section is really for them to talk to us and hear their feedback and to talk to one another. So the best part of the of that day a lot of times is just having them talk to us and again to each other, about things that are working, things that are not working, things that they've tried, and learning from one another. And we learn from them as well. ... one of the best parts of the day. Are these pro-users in the sense that do they love Slack? Is that something that's common among all of them, or are some of them a little bit more hesitant? So in this case, these are all people, that's not a criteria that I use. It's not a ... that I use for getting people on the CAB or not. They happen to mostly love Slack because they are responsible for rolling it out in their organization. One thing that is important to remember in enterprise software is that, those admins, they're your champions. Those admins, the people that are working with your software and managing your software. They've staked their career on the success of your product because that's their career. And so it's important to listen to them. It's important to treat them well. And so, they do mostly love Slack. They are mostly champions. But that's not what I, yeah, I don't ask that question. Ilan, what happens when there's a clash? There's a clash because you have a road map for enterprise, your colleague has a road map for the self serve, there's a finite resources as in any organization, and now you have to make some decisions. How do you quantify the impact of these two fields which are connected but disconnected? Yeah. A lot of it is art more than science especially when you're talking about Enterprise to enterprise, security to admin, is pretty easy. Right? You just look at the TAM, or the revenue impacted, or the pipeline that's blocked based on the features. We have reports that show us exactly how much pipeline is associated with these big security features or big administration features. That's easy. On the retail side it's also pretty easy because the numbers, the metrics tell you where to invest. We have a lot of experiments that we run there and see which one proves to be better. Enterprise to retail is a little bit more difficult. And for that, what we've done is, we have company priorities. There are always, always somehow there are three. But there are three company priorities. And you're your initiative similar to a company pitching to a VC. We pitch internally and it has to align to one of these three initiatives. And if it does, then those are the teams that get the resources for the year. So so cool. I'm so upset that we're more than halfway through because every question that you answer, I have 10 more questions that I wanna ask. I'll try to keep them short. No no. This has been perfect. Please don't. Ilan, looking back now, or actually looking forward, we can't avoid the fact that we're in a global pandemic and the world has changed forever and our workforce has changed forever. I'd love your take on where are we headed in terms of collaborative tools, productivity, as the world is shifting more and more towards remote collaboration either Slack or off Slack. How do you perceive our collaborative nature digitally as the years are going to go forward? Yeah. Well so, it's certain that this, we're not gonna go back to whatever normal was. I do think that the office is not a thing of the past. We will have offices again. We will all be in offices. It will be slightly different. I think we've all realized that people can actually just be just as productive at home as they can in the office, minus taking care of kids and all that, but we'll go to a world where kids are at school and parents can work. But I think that the thing that is, that the trend that we've seen, and this happened before covid by the way, is that responsibility and authority for decision making is brought down the org chart, right? It used to be that decisions went up and they were made at the top and then those orders came down. But that's, it's almost reversed. Decisions are being made in teams. And what's important for executives is now to understand all the decisions that are being made so they can better align and guide the team. That's a healthy thing. That's good for large organizations to function that way and I see in my work with organizations that are transforming themselves, that more and more of them are working to that. But I think that that is, that kind of reverse information flow is a new area that's going to be explored with tools. I don't think that that's an area that really has been explored with enterprise software. That is so so cool. Okay. And now you're, 20 years later, you're still in enterprise software, collaborative tools, productivity tools. Where are you going to go into your 21st year? I mean what does it do for you that you're in this unique space and in your unique position? Yeah. I'll tell you, and I don't mean to bring this back to Slack, we can talk about other things. But specifically, four years ago when I joined Slack and I went and visited my first customer, and it's a large bank in the East Coast. And I met with an employee there. And she told me, "I love my job more because I use Slack." Not I love Slack, which would also be great to hear and I hear that a lot. But I love my job. I'm here nine to five. I enjoy what I do day to day more because of this tool. I'm happier here. When you can have that kind of effect on most of the waking hours of a person, their time away from their family, that is rewarding. That's a mission that I'm happy to get behind and Slack is just one example of companies that are doing things like that, making people's lives easier and better at work. And are you, is it more the fact that you're more curious about enterprise software that you decided to focus on that space? Or do you see yourself ever shifting to the self serve? I get it. I get enterprise software. I don't get consumer software. You build something and then either someone likes it. Like you need a 14 year old to like your product and then all of a sudden, other people like it. I don't get that world. I definitely get enterprise software. I love it. I love it. Okay. Ilan, give me the broad picture of collaborative tools. Are we all moving more to real time communication, multiple integrations? Because it seems to me, it seems obvious that this is where we're headed. Is it more that we're going to see greater productivity using these tools? Or are we going to see more happiness levels or more satisfaction? Because I feel pretty productive right now, I have to say. I have about a dozen Slack channels from 10 different segments and workspaces, and I feel pretty productive. And I'm wondering whether there is now the aim is to increase my productivity or increase my happiness level? Yeah. I think that both go hand in hand by the way. I think that people could be both productive and happy and I think a lot of times they actually complement each other. So, if I'm able to be more productive, I'm able to be get more satisfaction out of my job. So, I wouldn't think of happiness as like just socializing at work or happiness as there is happiness from doing the work itself. I think, as far as where we're going, let me first take a quick second, I can't ever imagine going back to email. I mean, I can't ever imagine. in fact I would use this as definitely a show stopper in any future company I go to. I couldn't imagine coming in the morning and opening up an inbox and sorting through 100 or 200 emails like I used to. It just seems so counterproductive to have my information sorted by someone else based on what subject they wrote and where they, when they sent the message. With Slack and channels, I dictate where I work and what's important to me. I'm subscribing to the channels that are most important to the projects that are most important. I'm in control of my day. It's just, it's so backwards for me to think about email right now. - 100% As far as where we're going in the future, I think that there's no question you can see this with what Slack, you can see Teams, of course they copied us but whatever. You can see that channel based communication, this type of subscribing to the project and the topics that I care about, is the wave of the future. By the way, email is not different as far as the information that it carried. E-mail also had topics, right Everything that you did in email was a topic. You were hiring someone. You were working on a project. You were working on a campaign. And when you had ... had a channel Exactly. It just was disorganized. It was just organized chronologically based on when people sent you messages. It just isn't organized well. So, Slack is not like this is new type of work. It's just now organizing your work based on topics. And one of the actually really inspiring things that I've experienced recently is using Superhuman as a ... client because they managed to reduce the formality of the email. Up until now, I felt an email, I felt this grave responsibility, like it's so formal, Dear Sir ... sincerely Michael. Now with Superhuman, the way that they did it the chat based, same thing with Slack. When my manager here at Hippo Slacks me, I feel the informality. It feels like an ongoing conversation with the same content that I would otherwise get in an email. It makes me respond faster. It makes me more confident. All of a sudden I use emojis in my messages. I love using emojis. It sounds like a joke, but it's a serious thing. It makes everything more fun. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. And more productive. We use emojis, by the way, for productivity. So, when someone wants my attention in a channel, they put a file or something like that, I will use the eyes emoji to say that I'm looking at it. And that just tells him like calm down, I'm looking at it. I didn't miss your message. And then when I'm done, I put a green checkbox emoji saying it's done. I finished my assignment, whatever it is. And that way they know, okay, this is done. I'm starting to employ that with a team that I'm on right here. Yeah. Ilan, this was so, thank you for your time. Thank you for the generosity. This was so good. I know how busy you are. Before we leave, I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. Okay. Three words. So, there's one word that- However we want to do this. There's one word that actually means like all three together which is Kibbutznik. I mean I grew up in Ein Hod and moved to Minnesota at age 10. But the hard working, collaborative, and humble are things that I aspire to be in my job and I learned those all before the age of 10. Wow. Well, kibbutznik said it all. You gave me the three words anyways afterwards. I love it. Ilan, toda raba. Thank you very very much. We didn't even mention the whole J-Ventures and working together. And I've been, it's been such a pleasure doing some due diligence with you and I've been learning a lot from you and everybody else. But thank you for your time, for this, and for the fun. And I look forward to maintaining this relationship. Thank you. My pleasure. Thank you. Bye bye.
