1 So, to help a patient see progress, you have to ask questions about things just outside of pain score, and you have to make them both specific enough and general enough that the patient can see progress throughout. Rachel Trobman, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Welcome. Hi. Thank you so much for having me, Michael. Of course. Where in the world are you right now? I am in New Jersey. South Orange, New Jersey, which is not too far from the city of New York. That's an interesting name, South Orange. I like that. Yeah. It's like it feels like a. Go ahead. Exactly. But, that's exactly what it feels like. But what I really want to start talking about is your fun fact. You're in Peru, how do you get to sew somebody's arm back without even being a doctor? Even if you were a doctor, it sounds crazy. What happened over there? So, when I was in college, I spent the summer living in Urubamba Peru, which is like a small town in the Sacred Valley. I was working for an NGO and they put me, because I was interested in medicine and science and a working at a hospital. I didn't speak any Spanish at the time. I spoke fluent French. And the doctor that I was working with didn't speak any English. So, I would ask him questions in French and he would respond in Spanish. And that's how we got by. And mostly what I was doing was like doing patient intake, taking notes, kind of like setting and doing triage for the doctor. But one day he was, I forget what he was doing. He was like catering to another patient. And this patient came in having accidentally chopped his arm off on his birthday. And they needed somebody to, like, start doing the sutures right away. And the doctor was like, "You could get started." And I was like, "What do you mean I could get started?" And he was like, "Just there's all the tools that you need are in the room." And so, I was like, "Okay." I'm terrified just listening to this. I was like, okay, I guess we're doing this. And they needed hands. And then, of course, he joined me and we finished up the job. But there's nothing quite like a threat of just, you know, losing Hanukkah toys. And so, I, yeah, so that's what happened. That's how I did it. And thankfully, I didn't have to do it again. The most important question. Yes? Is the man okay? Is the person okay? He is totally fine. Yeah. I went on to do other x-rays. I did not go on to become a doctor. I realized that like emergency room trauma was like not my thing. But it was, yeah, it was one of those things where like I guess you learn on the ground, but it's not, anywhere else, that would not be acceptable. But there, the guy lived totally fine. And that's the story. Amazing. I love that. I definitely feel my heart pumping and terrified as you're telling that story. And just imagining myself in that situation. And I don't know if I could have done what you did. So, that's very impressive. But, Rachel, even more impressive is the, your really unique and amazing journey that you've had. Both in the medical side, but also in journalism and production and media, which is where I believe you spent quite a long time in partially, being a contributing author to in The New York Times, of all places, which is incredible. And now, most recently transitioned into the role of the CEO of Upside Health with Ouchie as one of the products. So, Rachel, I have to understand a little bit about your journey before we dive into the digital health markets. Talk to me about how do you go across these different industries? Yeah. Well, I mean, for me, it really started from, I was always interested in telling people stories and in journalism and media, particularly in health journalism. And I got my first job at New York One where I was on the digital side of things. And in the early days of digital journalism, it was really just like taking stories that were made for production, for TV, and then editing them into something that would work somewhat digitally. And everyone assumed that digital journalists were coders at that time. Anyone that was on the web was considered a coder. But I was just like, it was the first job I was able to get. So, I was a good writer and was able to do it. But being in that position offered me a lot of opportunities to like, try my hand at shooting, try my hand at reporting and try my hand at editing. And it also gave me a chance to work with content management systems. And so, I got pretty good at what I was doing and was approached to join a digital media company as a first hire. And that was my first foray into the startup world. And while there, and I have always been somebody who, as was attested by the hand sewing experience, if there was an opportunity to learn something in real time, I'll take it. I say yes before I say no. And so, here was an opportunity for me to immerse myself in something that I was very confident that I could execute but I had never done before. And then I quickly moved into business development and strategy, built the team from zero to like a billion lifetime views in just two years. And this is kind of on the side, but my husband's a software engineer, he's a technologist. And in the early days of iPhone development and apps, we decided to try our hands at that. I would do the content and he'd do the development. And so, we got really good at it as well. And it was a skill at that time that not many people were doing. So, people started hiring us to build apps for them. And so, I left my content development role and kind of moved it into this new space and started building for you know, Fortune 500 companies, startups, really leading product strategy, knowing that like being a good storyteller could transform based off the platform. And so, if you know how to tell a good story and make something compelling that people want to use or want to read or want to experience, you can transfer that skill. And so, when we got confident enough that we could build something from ideation to execution seamlessly, I decided we were ready to turn our attention to something more personal. Which kind of brings us to Upside Health. When I was 17, I was diagnosed with the connective tissue disease. That was incredibly painful. But I was a unique, albeit unfortunate advantage and that my mom has lupus and my brother has cystic fibrosis. So, I grew up in environments where managing complex chronic health conditions was the norm. Having a built in supportive environment was always there. And yet, even with all of these things, I found that pain was a tripping point. Right? There is no seamless easy way to manage pain because pain, unlike some of the other metrics that are being managed, are really subjective. And when a primary symptom of what you're living with is something that is really subjective, it becomes hard to communicate around. It feels hard to get validated. And it is hard to treat from just not like the patient perspective, but also from the clinician perspective. Something that people don't know, maybe not think about with like a lot of patients who have chronic diseases, is they spend a lot of time with their doctors. And if you're someone like me who has a journalistic background, who likes to ask questions and hear answers, you get to know their pain points really well. Right. And understand that, like, this wasn't just something I was experiencing as a patient saying, like, this is hard to manage and I'm frustrated and I'm isolated, but also something that the clinicians would say like this isn't easy. It's not easy for me either. And so, I found that there was like an opportunity right there to help facilitate change. So, how does that actually so, first of all, give you a little bit of a broader perspective into what's available today. How many people are going through somewhat of a similar experience or need help managing that experience, which led to your understanding that there is actually, not just an opportunity to help some people, but help a significant number of people where it can actually be a viable business that becomes Upside Health? Great question. So, I mean, it's very clear, I'm not running a nonprofit here as much as I would love to be able to help people just from that. But like, you have to, I was interested in building a business because I saw a substantial problem, as I said, but also a really large market opportunity. I mean, there are 50 million Americans. Right. Some people will say 100 million Americans, but I'm going conservative and saying 50 million Americans who live with chronic pain. 20 million of them. Yes. So, that's more than I think, heart disease and diabetes combined. If you add in like 100 million, that's diabetes, heart disease and cancer combined. Looking at the number is enormous. And 20 million of them live with debilitating chronic pain. So, that's the kind of chronic pain that limits your ability to work, to socialize, to conduct functional life tasks. And so, that population, though is only being served by about 4000 pain specialists. Meaning that there's less than one pain specialist for every 10 thousand Americans who live with chronic pain. Wow. So, 95% of chronic pain patients don't get access to specialized care. And then even those who do, those are pain specialists who we're seeing 40 patients a day and are being incentivized for the injections and the procedures and not necessarily for lengthy visits that discuss medication history. Like it's just, it's the way that the system is set up. Plus, they're doing their best to see as many patients as they can because there's so few people to offer this care. The other challenge with chronic pain is like, as I mentioned, you know, It is subjective in many ways, but it's also best served by multi-modal solutions. What do you mean by that? So, when pain is last longer than like six months, which is what would be defined as chronic pain, solutions that cater to the bio, social, emotional, like bio-psycho social environment are the most effective. Because pain, at that point, is not just coming from a physical location, it's coming from pain signals that are being sent from the brain. There is normally a depression or anxiety component. There's an isolation component. There's a movement component. And so, unless you are providing a multidisciplinary solution, you're going to have limited outcomes. But I mean, what I just explained to you is not scalable by most health care providers or most health systems, like in a traditional brick and mortar fashion. You really need, this is like an opportunity that's ripe for digital intervention because you just can't offer that service or those services en masse to people who are already having difficulty moving, right? Like, getting a patient to go to one doctor's visit is hard enough when they're in so much pain. Getting them to go to three different visits, remember them, might get value from them, have insurance cover them is just it's really hard. Right. And I guess, that's where Upside Health comes in. So, how are you actually helping, you know, this incredible market, that I'm shocked by the magnitude of it that we're talking about 50 million Americans, conservative speaking, that have some sort of chronic pain? How do you help them? Well, and the other thing to note about this really large market size is that we're also talking about incredible amount of spending within a health system. So like, an average chronic pain patient goes to the doctor 19 times a year. It costs the health system $34,000. So, there is more than $600 billion spent every year in chronic pain cost. So, I mean, this is not just like a big market, but it's a really expensive one for health systems payers really across the board. So, how do we help? How do we solve this? It's really about providing a multifaceted solution that providers can easily distribute to their patients that allows for not just behavior change on the point of the patient, but that behavior change creates a reduction in clinical burden. It also creates a decreased cost for a system and then incentivizes providers through it being reimbursable. The software is mobile software that uses the best of patient reported data. So, everything on mood, sleep, functional ability and then passively collected physiologic data to help the patient better understand what's happening with their pain. We help them set goals towards treatment like what would be, if their pain were 50% less, for instance, what they would do differently. And then based off of this information that they provide and that we gather, we connect them to a curated cohort of other patients, to ensure that nobody hurts alone. We also direct them to integrative wellness content. So, something that responds to their particular needs at a particular time. So, let's say the patient is reporting that they are having difficulty sleeping or sleeping under six hours a night, that sleep is restless. We know from their physiologic data that we've gathered that they have been rather sedentary. And their goal is to be able to go grocery shopping so they can have some nutritious meals in their house. The content that we provide maybe in at meditation's, exercises, stretches, information about like sleep hygiene, interactive content around preparing a grocery shopping list, for instance, and then support from other patients and our health coaches to help them reach those goals. And then the clinicians, on the other hand, get to view this high level data. We synthesize the data, we review it with our clinical team, and then we offer them everything that's required to build, so, that way they don't have to take that on internally. Interesting. So, walk me through the process. If I have, let's say I have chronic back pain, right, and I'm looking for that support. What is my interaction with this app on a daily basis? As well as, how does this connect to the triangle where the patient, the physician and the app? How does that happen? Yeah. So, you I mean, you could find the app for free on the app stores. But really our primary distribution model now is through your provider. So, you were going to either your a pain specialist, your primary care provider, your neurologist, your orthopedist, and they're saying we're now using this. We think that is medically beneficial and necessary for you to be part of this remote patient monitoring and behavioral health platform, Ouchie. Here's how you download it. Somebody from their team will also reach out to help on board you. You'll create an account where you enter some basic information and then we'll start pulling the data right away. And then based off of the data that we're pulling, we'll send your prompts and reminders about changes in your activity to say, like, okay, we've seen these changes, how do you now respond to these various patient reported information. And here is some content and community that we think that will support you. Now, you're like for four days of trying this non opioid based treatment, away from like earning a prize. And then me, the doctor who has introduced this to you, can look in real time and see this. Or, I could see the monthly reports at the end of each calendar month that I received from the Ouchie team that will give me the insights in how you've been engaging, what activities you've tried, what successes you've had, how your medication use has changed, what are the correlations between this and that. And then the doctor has the ability to act on that, but also to be able to bill insurance for that. Right. And it sounds like there's a lot of things that this is helpful with. First, that it allows the distribution of access, right? So, you can have some pain specialists that are now looking at and supporting multiple greater factor of patients because they're not necessarily looking and spending an hour on which they are looking at higher level data. You can obviously synthesize the data and then come up with some interesting conclusions. I'm curious about the user experience side of things. Because one of the things that you're mentioning with habit formation and goal setting, which is something that many apps try to do, right? The notorious to-do list app that you can write a million to dos, and never follow through with them. So, talk to me a little bit about goal setting and habit formation in the context of chronic pain, and how you're tackling that through user experience. So, one of the problems with the way that we've gathered and measured pain in the past is it's like solely dependent on the pain score. And so, it's really hard to see progress if like every time you're asked what your pain level is, it's a level eight. And there's so many reasons why a patient will give level eight. Maybe they really are in excruciating pain. Maybe the doctor won't take them seriously if they say six. Maybe they, I mean, there's just a lot. So, pain score, a lot of times doesn't vary. And so, to help a patient see progress, you have to ask questions about things just outside of pain score. And you have to make them both specific enough and general enough that the patient can see progress throughout. So, we tie progress to small functional tasks, but based off of what the patient is changing in their pain score or their mood in their sleep, we'll rearrange them in a different order. So, that way the patient can see progress. And the progress will change based off of various other scores. And also, there's some things that we ask in terms of smart goals. You know, if you're paying there's also the way that you ask a question, right? If you're paying were 50% less, what would you do differently. We're not asking patients to complete tasks for the sake of completing tasks. We're giving them tasks that are part of their regular life and asking them how close they are to completing it. And then we reward them for things that they might not realize that are our accomplishments. But sticking with something, for instance, it's almost like the surprise of you've been hanging in there. That's a reward, cheering on other users. And then through time, those things become a habit. Every time our users update, they have an option to either post privately just for themselves or their provider, or publicly, to the Ouchie community. And what we see is a lot of users start posting privately but are still engaging in the cheer and support of others. And then over time, they transition into being part of the community in a more complete way. So, we aren't forcing the users to do anything that they're not doing, but bit by bit like introducing behavior change techniques. I think the other thing that, you know, is missed a lot of time with just like forcing a program onto somebody is not meeting them where they're already at. So, with chronic pain patients, a lot of these patients have been dismissed. A lot of these patients have had to go to a lot of different providers before they find one that is specialized. As I mentioned, there's not a lot of specialized providers. So, a lot of patients are still being seen by their primary care doctor who doesn't have enough time. And so, creating an immediate contact with the patient of acknowledgment and recognition and say, okay, we see that these are the problems that you're having right now, here are some solutions right on this platform that can help you with that and then we'll introduce something maybe that you haven't thought of. But until you can address some of their immediate need, it's really hard to gain the patient's trust that, like, we're really on their team. We're not just trying to like, force something upon them that the doctor once. I don't know if that makes sense. And then we have to build that trust on a clinical side as well. Then we have to build this trust on the clinical side as well that like we're not trying to create more work for them, that we know how challenging our jobs. We are like, we have to build not like a marketplace, but you do have two different types of clients that you're trying to support. 100%. And it makes perfect sense that the complexity is there, the importance of it is there the you know, the sensitivity is there. Because I think, one of the interesting complexities that you're introducing here, the layer of the user experience of trying to identify the pain and measure something that is qualitative not quantitative, but you're trying to do it in a way that is aligning incentives. Because at the end, your incentive is to gauge the real pain so that you can help them form their habits and pass that information to the physician. Their incentive is to get better. And there is sort of this misalignment in the industry right now where if you don't, if sometimes you're not you know, dramatic enough or exuberant enough about it, then perhaps people are not going to take you seriously enough. Especially I'm guessing, in an industry where you're saying that there's 95% people that don't have the care that they need to have. So, it sounds like what you're doing here is hugely, hugely important. I do have to apologize that I should have called this show 30 minute leaders are not 20 Minute Leaders. But Rachel, this has been fascinating. And I want to thank you for being generous with your time. My last question is, the most important one, which is the three words that you would use to describe yourself. Tenacious. Passionate. And compassionate almost to a fault. I like that. I like that. And I'm sure that you have to have those things in order to do what you're doing there. And I wish we could talk more about it, about the journey and the transition from journalism and production and media to this. But this is all wonderful. Rachel, thank you for helping improve people's lives. I love businesses that are taking people that need help, finding a good business solution that is a win-win situation. I truly believe that in order to make a real impact, there has to be aligned incentives. People don't work for free. In order to have the best people with you, it needs to be a viable business. And that's why I am unapologetically saying we're not a non-profit, we're a for profit business, but we're helping improve people's lives. And that's a win win situation that is beautiful. So, thank you for doing that. And stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you. Thank you so much for having me. And you stay well as well.
