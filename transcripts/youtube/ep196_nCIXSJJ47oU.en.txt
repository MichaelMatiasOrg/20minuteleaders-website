[Music]
omri kriegel thank you for being on my
show how are you
i'm good thank you very much thank you
for having me i i'm so
honored to have you i've heard so much
about you from my good friend mickey and
you've invested in him and so
over the past uh pretty long time i've
been i've been hearing about
really a wonderful relationship between
an investor and a founder and i've been
gaining inspiration as to the type of
investors that i will look for
and the type of relationships that i
would want to have but on marie i i'd
love to start this show
before we get to your investment thesis
and how you operate
i'd love to talk a little bit about you
because you have an unconventional story
of how you of of your life journey and
given all the adversities that you've
that you've had you've
come to a really wonderful place with
with i think some pretty
remarkable insights so marie why don't
you take me all the way back
and however much you feel comfortable
sharing i'd love to hear about the
different things that
that that happen along the way and and
some of the insights that you've gained
from them
sure so again thank you for having me
and
honored to be here
maybe i'll go a little bit about my
background so just to have the full
picture about myself and where i'm
coming from and what's what's my
background
and etc so i was born in a tiny place in
the south of israel actually in the
desert called
arad this is where i was
you know born and grew up um i think it
really it's
it's it was a wonderful place that
impacted me significantly mostly around
values and morals and the people i grew
up with gave me the drive and pushed to
you know to many of that
you know of i guess the values that i'm
currently
aspiring for um after you know great
childhood down in the south in the
desert
i i i went to the israeli uh army and i
served for uh
i guess around seven years in in the
israeli navy seals
so uh that was a very meaningful time
for me i
i served there as a combat soldier later
as a as an officer as a captain
uh and i guess this really shaped my
mentality around
you know kind of never give up mentality
hard work and things that comes with
with serving in such a
in such a unit and then uh then i'm
basically i want to do my
my my undergrad in them in idc which is
the interdisciplinary center and
herzeglia
and i started this administration
entrepreneurship in the cell program
um and this gave me some more
understanding about business and
and entrepreneurship in general because
i'm not coming from
from this type of background at all both
of my parents worked you know
down south and the uh you know work
general works over there i had the best
childhood but it's not i don't have the
business so i didn't have the business
or
entrepreneurial um bring up
uh upbringing sorry but don't marry how
talk to me a little bit about zelle so
zell i know very very well we had both
lyat our own son on the show who was the
executive director i don't know if she
was the executive director when you were
in zell
but uh yeah one of and so she she's a
phenomenal person
and so many other israelis that that
have been on this show alone al roy
and and uh from from zelda so
why why go to the zeal entrepreneurship
program you're in combat in the idea if
you grow up
in ahad how do you end up deciding that
you want to be an entrepreneur
so you want to hear the true story or
just uh
i tell you so the way it was i was like
every israeli after my military service
i went to
travel some people go to the far east i
went to south america i already enrolled
to tel aviv university
to study the law and uh while i was in
bariloche
in the south of you know argentina um
you know between one party to the other
a friend of mine sent me an email
saying hey he was studying at idc and he
said well i think you would like this
program i think it fits you and i went
to the website was you know
2005 2006 very different than what it is
right now
and i don't know something ticked
something made me feel that uh that it
that it's it's right for me you know
that the freedom around it and the
understanding
you're gonna learn new you know new
things and how to start your own
business and i just said
this this is for me and and then i
changed my enrollment and went to the
idc so this is
this was the only you know this was the
thing that made me go to study
uh in the zl program um yeah so so
how were those how was your time with
the zelda program
you're starting out saying okay i wanna
i'm i might be a law student you end up
in the you end up in an
excellent entrepreneurship world what
what were some things that really
excited you about it
i think it's a combination of the people
around you uh
and so one is the people around you
second is the level of the program the
level of the academic program and the
fact that you can combine academic world
into real life hands-on activities so i
think that and
i think that this combination was very
unique for me the fact that i can learn
and write
a business model on a business that i'm
trying to build myself which was a
complete failure by the way
uh i think that i think that it was uh
it was a great experience for me
incredible okay so you so
you're finished the idc you finish this
entrepreneurship program and then
and let's continue on the journey so
finished then i then i basically had an
opportunity to open a
you know a coffee shop in israel so i
opened uh i raised capital for for the
first business that i did
i raised capital significant amount of
capital for me back then
from external investors from the us uh i
bought a couple of
local friends that joined the investors
as well and we opened the coffee a big
coffee shop and uh
and one of the biggest entertainment
centers in israel uh in the
cinema city in in in regional scene
whoever knows it
wow and and uh
and i think i remember the night that i
signed the contract of this investment
of this deal
i i didn't sleep for for a whole night
and i had a girlfriend back then asked
me what
why didn't you sleep what's going on you
know it's supposed to be a happy day
i said i can't believe i took
responsibility for other people's money
and
you know if it's going to fail and a lot
of you know
i won't say insecurities but kind of
things that are coming with
taking responsibility and stepping right
i think it was very healthy by the way
those feelings right
they are healthy they are healthy i
think that as even you know even now
today when i will talk later about what
i do today but even
now when i you know do investment uh and
manage fund which
with other people's money or you know
founders they take money or
take investments from from they come to
a lot of responsibility and i think it's
good to have this kind of like sense of
i won't say fear because fear is not
healthy but sense of responsibility this
is something that i think is very
important
so i did that i did it for six months i
didn't even know how to
how to do coffee in the machine you know
i don't even know
until today how to make coffee or
anything like that i wasn't at all on
the operational side after six months
i've joined the
uk based startup which they were looking
for
an israeli kind of like country manager
which was quite interesting because it's
a uk startup it's two founders
and the first role that they wanted to
hire is someone from israel to be the
country manager so
in a way i was first employee country
manager but of a company that just
started
it was exciting right i had a very
great experience over there i worked
with the two founders
uh we're very close until today great
investor behind them
and um yeah it was my first basically
international experience you know
starting to work for an international
company and learning you know
how to operate in the big world and i
think it was a
great school for me and the company did
well later and but i think it was a
exceptional exceptional uh experience
during the during that time when i was
basically starting the operations in
israel and hired a team and a lot of
responsibility
again i had a very severe injury back
then it was 2011 and
uh i did i went to a party with friends
and i
i i basically i went with a very good
friend of mine girlfriend of mine for a
night swim after the party and i jumped
in a bad place in into shallow water and
i
and i and i and i basically broke my my
neck and i was
and i was paralyzed for about i guess uh
i still am i'm still injured and i have
a lot i walk with crutches and using
sometimes wheelchair and but
i do still uh i i i still suffer from
the
injury but i was in hospital for about a
year plus which was quite interesting
because i
kept managing the company from my bed in
in the hospital
yeah people came to do meetings next to
the bed but it was between
rehabilitation
between rehabilitation to to try to
sleep to um
you know do other medical activities i
try to kept
kind of like sanity and to to keep doing
uh to keep
working uh it wasn't ideal but i still
try to keep a kind of like a
uh a level of you know a routine
in a way what was the part and the whole
if you look back at those year and that
year and a half so obviously there
are so many difficulties that come with
such an injury whether it's
you know the the paralysis of not being
able to go out of the hospital or not
being able to be as efficient as you
want at work or maybe
in the relationship with your friend and
your and your loved one
so out of the when looking back what
were some really like
the really difficult things that you you
feel that you know
i'm we might not i i obviously won't be
able to really understand
through a conversation like this
so i think the biggest challenges were
first of all i felt um
i think that the biggest challenges were
to understand that i've
that my life have changed completely uh
and to accept it
to accept that was something that wasn't
easy just imagine yourself back then i
was 30 years old
you know managing a company in a very
young age
you know having a dating beautiful girls
you know
doing a marathons three atlanta you know
just super active
uh physically and then suddenly
completely uh
paralyzed you know neck down completely
paralyzed and then being fed being
you know washed being you know taking me
from the bed to the wheelchair with a
with a with a crane it's
losing a whole sense of self i guess was
that the most
or changing the sense of self in a way
was the most uh
challenging thing i guess in parallel to
that of course the feeling of
disappointing my family and the worries
about my future and how it's going to
look like
uh and and and finding my friends and
everyone around me was
was i think this was a very big
challenge back then
and so you finish year and a half you
come out of the hospital
obviously nine years later you're still
dealing with the you're still dealing
with it with the injury
and but but but you went back to the to
a lot of the original life that you had
before then
and so so let's continue that from that
point on so i i think that
after i was one one a year plus in
hospital then
another year in a full rehabilitation
but then
i was i said to myself you know i was
very lucky to have
solid family around me great friends and
and feeling that i'm gonna
overcome it uh and i fought really hard
to overcome it
uh and uh i always dreamt about doing uh
to study to doing
an mba abroad so i was you know from
that you know young child that
grew up in the south do then suddenly
you're in the heritage which is the
center of israel and
zell program and then i see i saw
success and i wanted
always to study abroad and i i i the
first thing that i did after i
had my recovery was to uh basically
apply for an mba abroad and i want to do
the uh
an mba in chicago uh business school so
i did that yeah
2014 to 2016. it was a huge
great experience you know suddenly you
know i'm i'm studying with
so many interesting people global people
feeling that i'm
being exposed to new cultures new ways
of making business
uh so i really really enjoy that that
that period
um in parallel to that i established
another you know
israeli entity for a uk best company
so i did that for uh about another two
years then i went to
work abroad in in in new york
uh for uh for a tech company where i did
business development for the company
after my mba
but i guess from from 2014 15 i'm
looking in
for investments and i'm doing due
diligence and sourcing screening
um israeli early stage companies for
you know high net individuals family
offices from abroad and we did a couple
of investments
and in 2018 i've established homework
ventures which is uh
which is a fund that invests in uh uh
early stages startups uh
in israel but not not only we invested
also in american companies another so we
were open we're not
necessarily geographically focused uh
and i really enjoy it this is what i do
since 2018
and uh it's it's a it's a great
experience and i learned a lot and
i really really like it amazing so i
think it's just inspiring that
from the from for an upbringing that is
not necessarily in the most
entrepreneurial environment that you
have
you you you come through the israeli
military you go to the idc go to the
zell program
you study entrepreneurship more
professionally through
studying creating businesses and either
failed or successful it doesn't really
matter but you go to business school and
now
you're now you're a renowned investor in
israel but i
i also want to understand a little bit
about some of the you know
the key takeaways that you have from
either your upbringing your
military service the adversities that
you've had and i know there were more
than than we spoke about here
but but they're very significant and i'm
sure they're a very significant part of
your identity
and i think this is a very special
episode for me because unlike a lot of
other guests here it's
it's a very special story that you know
a lot of people grow up in a in a very
entrepreneurial household or a very
technological household and they
grow into this environment they don't
put themselves there
their place there and and you put your
you inserted yourself into a lot of
these arenas whether it's business
school or it's the the zell program or
or creating a business so i'd love to
hear a little bit of reflection from you
about
that upbringing and perhaps what you
would tell your younger self or what you
would tell
other young teens around the world who
don't necessarily have the opportunities
presented to them
like you had well i think that
you know you don't need i think that you
you can find entrepreneurial
entrepreneurial spirit or kind of like
um
step up mentality in every culture where
you're coming from i remember my
grandmother you know when when i was
young
i think that this is something that many
old people in israel used to do but
you know she used to buy you know cheese
that comes in plastic
you know kind of like cups and then and
after we finished you know those cream
cheese she used to wash them and we used
to choose to put a syrup in that for
drinking and stuff so
i think entrepreneurial and thinking out
of the box mentality is something that
you
can observe everywhere it relates to the
environment that you're at which is
really israel is a very
you know supportive uh uh culture to
that
uh but in it can come by your
surrounding but a lot of it also
should i think or i don't know should is
a hard word but
i think can come from your inner world
and personality
uh to have uh you know a mentality or a
sense of
or to feel that everything is possible i
really believe in that i
really believe in dreaming big i really
believe in it that everything is
possible
sky's the limit all these cliches they
are not in my opinion anyway that this
is like
anyway this is how my life uh proved me
so far i always dreamed about being in
the israeli navy seal but i was a chubby
boy
uh so i did a diet by the age of 16 and
i lost
15 kilos and i got i was always strong
but i
i i decided you know so this is
something that i did
back then or you know going into the zen
program which i
had to improve some some grades or um
learning to walk again you know it's
something that i set myself a goal i
said i'm going to learn to walk again
i'll be able to walk again maybe i can't
walk as i used to work right but it's
lucky that we did this interview while i
said
but still i think that i think that you
know
setting high goals uh and and being uh
having uh
setting high goals and having a dream
big and target
high i think it's someone that everyone
can have
it's not something and and if if if you
do so
life will i believe that life will will
show you the way and
things can happen even if you're not
coming from the most obvious
upbringing possible i think that's
something that's amazing but
you know at the end a lot of people face
adversity and
a lot of people are you know trying
different things and they're and they're
getting knocked down and then everybody
says just get back up just do it again
the knocking down that you had
specifically with that injury
and literally being paralyzed not being
able to continue doing the marathons and
triathlons not being able to operate as
efficiently as you could
as you were in in the peak of the in the
peak of your years right
that's that's a dramatic knocking down
what do you tell yourself at that point
when you're in the bed in the hospital
and you have people coming to you for
meetings and you must feel inside that
you're not fulfilling your potential at
that point right
it i'm imagining that it's something
that caught that is constantly with you
so how do you go through the that year
plus
what what do you tell yourself in your
mind and obviously that's something that
a lot of people that are getting knocked
down
could tell themselves but for you it was
a much more dramatic scenario
i'll tell you a story i think maybe
maybe it will encapsulate
what my thinking around that well a few
nights after i was woke up
i was i was in coma for a few days and
then
i woke up a few days after i woke up i
i couldn't move anything i was in bed
completely and i had a high fever and i
was it was
midnight or you know maybe one two a.m i
was sleeping in a bed in the hospital
and then then scare and my mother was
was just next to me
um and i cried and i cried
i woke up and i cried and and i i didn't
think that she would hear me
and she asked me what happened and i
told her well mom i ruined my life i
ruined your life or in my brother's life
or in everyone's life
life is ruined and she told me well as
long as we are together
and you're here everything's
everything's gonna be okay
and from a mother perspective to think
that you know okay
she could have lost her son a few hours
ago or a few days ago whatever
and now he's here then nothing is as bad
so i think that it's there was oh
i always tried and i still aspire to try
man
obviously i failed i failed sometimes
but i always try to
grab or hold into the positive and good
things in life and you know and try to
find a path
uh around that yeah it was very easy for
me to to be there and say okay
my life is ruined i'm gonna give up and
that's it and and and it's done
but i decided to choose the other pet to
believe in myself to believe that
despite
the changes things will be things will
be okay and by the way this is something
that i would say to
entrepreneurs many times you know many
times you can hit the wall
or hit uh or or you need to do changes
in your plans as entrepreneurs business
spend
your personal life whatever and i think
that uh
i think that uh changes are not always
necessarily bad even the change i i can
also see the good things that happened
since my injury and if you ask me today
okay
wait if i throw you back uh 10 years ago
would you change you know wouldn't jump
i don't know i have a you know a child
today
many things many so many good things
happened since
so um and you know i have
work that i like i have a partner
everything is you know so
i i don't think i think that focusing on
the positive and not the good is the
right thing to do
in any aspect in any element this is uh
this was inspiring thank you
and uh and and i'm very excited to
continue getting to know you better and
hopefully
and continue maintaining this
relationship both the friendship and and
professionally because it's just
i just love your your outlook and i i
grew up you know throughout high school
and with it with dana really is also as
sort of a role model and and i got a
chance to work with him later
he too he went through some very very
difficult adversity at the age of 17
and he wanted to be a pilot in the air
force he wanted to do different things
and he couldn't physically because of an
injury
let's give donna a brownie point here
because i know dan well
and when i got after i had recovery done
was we had a lot of conversations about
about
about injuries and etc and he really
gave me a lot of uh
support and and a lot of back he backed
a lot of
you know my recovery so that's uh no no
that that's wonderful and i so i get so
much inspiration from the two of you
right before we leave or marie i want to
thank you again for being so generous
with your time i know that you're
traveling right now
and and so thank you for taking the time
to do this but i need three words that
you would use to describe yourself
and i'm going to go with the fourth one
a resilient is the first one
you have two left i'm sorry i never did
this but but i'm going to get the first
one
i'm going to go on the phrase well
better i'm going to go into
on a phrase rather than words i think
it's going to be never give up
maybe maybe that's going to make it but
if you want three words we can go with
that as well however no no no
never give up is wonderful i'm ready so
dagobah thank you very very much
and i i look forward i look forward to
continuing getting to know each other
thank you
thank you thank you very much bye-bye
