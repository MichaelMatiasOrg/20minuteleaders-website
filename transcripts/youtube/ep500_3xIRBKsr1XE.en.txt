i took the plunge i for me and and for
uh my team the idea of helping people
uh regardless of where you are at in
your career
uh whether you're a strong performer or
not
whether you're at entry level mid-level
and
with somebody that's completely tailored
to you to your needs
that allows you to be in charge of who
you are
was really important
