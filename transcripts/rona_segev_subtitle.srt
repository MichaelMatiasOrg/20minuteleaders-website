1
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,680
Okay, Rona Segev, thank you so much

2
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,040
for being on my show 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,920
How are you?

4
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,080
Good. Thank you for inviting me.

5
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,800
Hi.

6
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,800
I am so honored to have you here.

7
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,000
We've been trying to do this for a while.

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,120
And I'm so happy that you feel better

9
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,440
and that we're finally getting to do this

10
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,720
because you're one of the

11
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,000
leading investors in Israel.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,640
A founding partner at TLV Partners,

13
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,160
one of the leading

14
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,760
investor funds in Israel.

15
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,320
But you're also

16
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,760
a general partner of Pitango,

17
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,880
with countless of successful investments

18
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,480
over the past years,

19
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,520
both in the Israeli tech industry

20
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,720
and outside of it.

21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,400
Rona, who are you?

22
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,800
So, give me a little bit of background

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,120
as to who you are and how do you get

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,720
to become a leading investor?

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,920
Wow, who am I.

26
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,000
It's just the first question.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,320
Well, I can tell you about

28
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,520
how I started my career,

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,360
which is kind of weird.

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,660
I started by learning

31
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,480
psychology and philosophy

32
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,480
in the Hebrew University,

33
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,240
nothing to do with high tech.

34
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,560
When I was 24, I had this crazy idea

35
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,400
to do something in computers.

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,600
It was '95.

37
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,560
We didn't have VCs in Israel back then

38
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,720
and I didn't know the world, the startup.

39
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,680
So, everything was really really new.

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,640
But I found someone who was crazy enough

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,000
to give me two 200K and we started.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,080
And eventually what we did was

43
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,920
we were a company that was developing

44
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,000
shoot 'em up games

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
like really hardcore gaming company.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,120
We developed three games,

47
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,840
one of them even became a hit, big hit.

48
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,240
Okay.

49
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,880
There is even a retro about it.

50
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,560
You can get that from the internet

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
if you want to embarrass me,

52
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,000
it's called Virus.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,880
And then I sold the company

54
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,520
when I was 27.

55
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,240
Wow.

56
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,000
Then pregnant

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,360
with my first set of twins.

58
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,440
So, I have two sets of twins.

59
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,040
Wow, that's amazing.

60
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,800
Two sets of twins. Wow.

61
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,640
Yeah.

62
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,360
And the main reason

63
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,920
I joined the VC back then

64
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,400
was because I thought to myself,

65
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,560
"Well, you're now a young mom,

66
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,880
for at least two or three years

67
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,320
it's probably not very wise

68
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,400
to be an entrepreneur again."

69
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,000
"Let's do something easier."

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,360
And this is why I joined

71
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,240
the VC community.

72
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,880
I joined Evergreen back then.

73
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,000
Incredible.

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,280
So, take me back because it sounds like

75
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,600
there's a little bit of discrepancy

76
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,680
between where you are at 24

77
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,600
and what you've studied

78
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,320
to going into the gaming industry.

79
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,720
What was the trigger there?

80
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,120
Why gaming?

81
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,280
We started with something which was,

82
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,120
the initial concept was taking Lego

83
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,320
and putting it on computers.

84
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,200
But at that time, there was something

85
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,120
which was called edutainment,

86
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,600
and we found ourselves inside the segment,

87
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,880
which was a horrible segment.

88
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,680
Full of multimedia CDs.

89
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,400
And I just didn't like it.

90
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,320
I told to myself,

91
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,000
"We don't want to be there."

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,760
And then we said,

93
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,080
"Okay, let's take this robot

94
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,760
that we're building

95
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,480
with those Lego

96
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,640
and let's go and fight."

97
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,480
And we just basically

98
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,600
kind of copied DOOM

99
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,720
and started to do games

100
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,440
which are very similar to DOOM,

101
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,760
and things followed each other.

102
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,680
Wonderful.

103
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,240
Yeah. And very quickly we became

104
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,400
a pure gaming company.

105
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,000
And that is until you're 27

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,200
where you sell the company,

107
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,560
you become  a VC

108
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,720
and you start to invest

109
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,440
in other companies.

110
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,000
Talk to me a little bit

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,360
about this transition

112
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,720
going from entrepreneur to an investor

113
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240
and what are some of the thought processes

114
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,080
that take you throughout this journey?

115
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,560
So, it was

116
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,480
a very humbling experience, actually,

117
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,000
because I was an entrepreneur

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,960
in the gaming industry.

119
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,440
And when I joined Evergreen

120
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,560
and we were dividing fields among us

121
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,400
and no one wanted

122
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,720
enterprise software and security.

123
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,280
It's funny, but back then

124
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,080
we're talking about '99, 2000,

125
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,040
it wasn't considered to be

126
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,000
a very good area to invest in.

127
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,680
So, and I was the most junior,

128
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,400
the new junior female partner.

129
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,800
So, they gave me,

130
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,960
they handed me this segment.

131
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,160
And then I started to invest

132
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,840
in enterprise software

133
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,640
I didn't know anything.

134
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,800
So, and really, sometimes I apologize

135
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,280
for entrepreneurs I met back then

136
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,080
because I just sit right there

137
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,120
and they were talking about

138
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,360
all kind of like weird stuff,

139
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,040
which now are so natural to me.

140
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,720
But back then, I just really

141
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,040
I didn't understand a word.

142
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,240
I remember the first three months

143
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,040
I was going back home to my husband

144
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,560
every night and crying saying,

145
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,760
"I will never understand

146
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,440
what they're talking about."

147
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,720
Wow.

148
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,120
But I was just asking a lot.

149
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,360
But I just started asking,

150
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,240
I was asking questions constantly.

151
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,840
And this is one thing

152
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,320
that I've learned since,

153
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,240
never to be ashamed

154
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,440
that you don't know something.

155
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
You can learn. Okay?

156
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,840
Just tell the person,

157
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,880
"You know, I'm not familiar."

158
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,080
"Can you please tell me more about it?"

159
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,800
And so, the first year and after years,

160
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,320
I was basically listening and learning.

161
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,200
And became close friends

162
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,240
with different entrepreneurs

163
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,280
and different people in the industry.

164
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,080
And I was just going

165
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,120
and asking for explanations

166
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,640
and then I started to invest.

167
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,800
And I was lucky I must say.

168
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,960
Because I think, when I started to invest

169
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,040
in enterprise software and security,

170
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,240
this was exactly the time,

171
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,800
it was like 2002, that those areas

172
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,600
became hot areas in Israel.

173
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,040
And most of the exit be coming at

174
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,600
enterprise software and security,

175
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,760
and here I was, in the perfect time,

176
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,280
in the perfect industry

177
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,040
just starting my career.

178
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,240
And very quickly

179
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,560
I started to have my [--]

180
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,680
and the rest is history.

181
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,120
But I think it's interesting

182
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,600
because they say a lot that

183
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,280
to be a successful entrepreneur,

184
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,080
timing is one of the most critical aspect.

185
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,280
It's not just about your team

186
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,880
and about your execution,

187
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,480
it's about whether the market is ripe

188
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,680
for your execution to go into that market.

189
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,200
And it sounds like

190
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,320
that's a very similar experience

191
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,680
to what you had as an investor.

192
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
You're coming in, its 2002,

193
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,120
the cybersecurity space

194
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,960
and enterprise space is booming in Israel.

195
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,560
And you get to be there

196
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,960
just as you've built the confidence

197
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,680
to just start making these investments.

198
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,840
And so, one of the things

199
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,560
that we chatted previously

200
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,480
just a little bit about,

201
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,080
and I'd love to elaborate here,

202
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,400
is this whole notion of

203
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,720
what it takes to succeed

204
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,480
in the field that you're in.

205
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,320
While I'm sure that a lot of times

206
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,240
it may be cutthroat

207
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,480
and it's very competitive,

208
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,440
I read in a few places

209
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,440
your take on the type of personality

210
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,280
that you can be

211
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,800
as you go about your journey.

212
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,360
So, talk to me a little bit about that.

213
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,840
I think, one of the things that

214
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,360
I didn't like about my career

215
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,280
and I didn't like about the industry,

216
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,040
and I'm not talking

217
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
specifically about Israel,

218
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,600
though that we see it a lot in Israel,

219
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,840
I also I'm working a lot

220
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,960
with VCs in the US

221
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,360
and I see it also in the US,

222
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,640
and it's a culture

223
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,680
which is very very aggressive

224
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,640
and I call it very focused

225
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,120
on short term optimization.

226
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,720
And the reason I'm calling it

227
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,360
short term optimization is because

228
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,280
sometimes I feel that

229
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,040
whenever two people are in the room

230
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,480
arguing about something,

231
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,040
someone has to win

232
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,920
no matter what are the consequences.

233
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,520
And it doesn't matter even if it's like

234
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,200
how much you get for your lunch every day,

235
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,000
or covering your travel costs

236
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,480
or stuff like that, which are

237
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,280
totally insignificant for the company

238
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,520
and can really damage the company

239
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,480
if the employees feel

240
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,080
that they're not getting enough.

241
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,520
But still, just because of the dynamics

242
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,240
of power in the room,

243
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,880
many times it's very hurtful

244
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,640
at the end of the day to the company.

245
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,120
I felt it also in the relationship

246
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,960
between VCs and entrepreneurs.

247
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,760
If you think about it,

248
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,520
and really if you take all the noise

249
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,960
and just focus on the essence of our job,

250
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,000
the only way that we can be successful

251
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,920
is if our companies and our entrepreneurs

252
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,760
will be successful.

253
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,680
And really it's everything about

254
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,480
VC investment.

255
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,520
So, if you start playing around

256
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,240
with the entrepreneurs firing them,

257
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,120
the chances of your companies

258
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,360
to be successful are reduced dramatically.

259
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,680
So, basically you are investing in people

260
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,280
and really the aim of this investment,

261
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,120
and what will make me successful is that

262
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,040
if my entrepreneurs will be successful.

263
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,600
And everything is built around that.

264
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,080
And so, I didn't understand

265
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,120
why people are fighting

266
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,920
with their entrepreneurs so much,

267
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,080
why they're trying

268
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,440
to squeeze them out of things,

269
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,680
why are they not creating these

270
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,600
alliance of interest and working together.

271
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,280
This was something that really bothered me

272
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,680
for many many years.

273
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,160
And this was one of the drivers

274
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,040
of starting TLV partners,

275
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,560
to prove to myself, first of all,

276
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,040
that we can be very successful

277
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,840
and work differently.

278
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,960
Sometimes I think that

279
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,120
people are seeing too many American movies

280
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,240
and we are too much influenced about TV

281
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,520
that the successful figures

282
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,760
are always vicious and aggressive

283
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,240
and totally concentrated on their needs.

284
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,400
And we grow up thinking

285
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
that this is the only way

286
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,960
to be successful.

287
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,080
And I actually see it

288
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,040
because I grew up in Jerusalem,

289
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,240
I just truly believe that it's not true.

290
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,040
That actually working with people

291
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,880
in collaboration

292
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,920
and creating a win-win environment

293
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,080
will actually create a situation

294
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,160
where people want to work with you

295
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,760
again and again.

296
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,000
They recommend their friends,

297
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,560
and it's just fun working like that.

298
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,360
Just everyone enjoys working together

299
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,400
instead of suffering

300
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,160
and being in conflict, constant conflict.

301
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,040
100%.

302
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,280
So, the forming of TLV Partners,

303
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,120
today every entrepreneur in Israel

304
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,080
and many abroad know of  TLV partners,

305
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,160
but talk to me the early days.

306
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,000
So, going back to just starting out,

307
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,600
previously, you were at Pitango,

308
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,680
another wonderful

309
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,040
investment firm in Israel.

310
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,720
So, I understand the trigger

311
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,200
to form TLV partners.

312
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,960
It's your own,

313
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,120
there is a different mentality,

314
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,840
you're defining the culture.

315
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,480
So, a lot of entrepreneurs that I talk to

316
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,240
they're talking about how culture

317
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,600
was one of the things that they set out

318
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,920
to concentrate on from day one.

319
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,760
You're saying also,

320
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,080
it's the same thing in VC.

321
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,440
I want my partners and myself

322
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,360
to have a certain culture

323
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,920
with our founders.

324
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,840
What are some of the greatest challenges

325
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,560
and maybe joyous events

326
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,480
of starting TLV partners

327
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,440
in throughout this journey?

328
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,040
So the first thing was just going out

329
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,800
and pitching this message,

330
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,600
as I just told you,

331
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,720
to employees, to our investors.

332
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,240
And I was really scared.

333
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,480
I thought that they're looking

334
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,160
to seek people with knives like

335
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,160
walking around like with blood dripping.

336
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,080
And I was hoping that

337
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,960
they would look at me and say,

338
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,360
she's weak or she's too nice,

339
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,240
or it won't work.

340
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,120
But we were very true to our message

341
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,440
because really, we actually really believe

342
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,240
that this is something

343
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,080
that we wanted to do.

344
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,200
It was very important to us

345
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,880
that our employees would understand

346
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,800
what is the culture

347
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,120
that we're trying to build.

348
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,920
It turned out that just like

349
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,840
two or three years before,

350
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,360
as many of the employees

351
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,720
started to realize that VCs that are

352
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,200
actually following this type of culture

353
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,800
are more successful or are as successful

354
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,720
as very tough and cruel VCs

355
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,320
because the entrepreneurs like them;

356
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,920
because they recommend others

357
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,560
to come and get their money;

358
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,880
because overall, the experience

359
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,680
working with them is more pleasant.

360
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,840
So, entrepreneurs are more focused

361
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,680
on building the company

362
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,320
and not fighting with the VCs.

363
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,800
Right.

364
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,760
Actually, it was received very well

365
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
this message, which was a big surprise,

366
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,080
a very pleasant surprise

367
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,200
to what we've done

368
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,920
and we raised our first fund very quickly.

369
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,800
It took us a few months

370
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,480
to raise $110,000,000.

371
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,840
In Israel, this is amazing.

372
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,360
At that time, this was 2015,

373
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,720
VCs were raising funds for three years.

374
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
It took them three years

375
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,120
to raise the funds.

376
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,960
And we raised like,

377
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,000
from really really tough year

378
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,760
here in the US.

379
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,680
I remember when we did the closing,

380
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,840
I was so happy.

381
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,360
I just couldn't believe that we made it.

382
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,720
It's like an entrepreneur

383
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,120
raising a fund.

384
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,000
It's totally.

385
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,560
We have foreign investors,

386
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,600
were going out there asking for money,

387
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,400
someone is saying "no" many times

388
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,920
just because they don't like us.

389
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,040
It's pretty similar actually. Yeah.

390
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,440
How is your relationship

391
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,920
with the founders that you invest in?

392
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,320
And I know quite a few of them.

393
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,600
And so, I know that

394
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,000
it's a wonderful relationship.

395
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,840
But I'd like to know a little bit

396
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,040
about your side of it.

397
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,360
So, as a VC, you get to meet

398
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,000
with your entrepreneurs once in a while.

399
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,080
You get to help them on their journey.

400
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,280
You're in the trenches with them,

401
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,040
obviously, in a lot of the cases.

402
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,560
What are some of the key points in time

403
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,680
that you're valuable for the entrepreneurs

404
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,960
that work with you?

405
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,360
So, first of all, it's really important

406
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,960
to say that it's very different

407
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,080
with each entrepreneur

408
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,000
because they're different people.

409
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,480
So, it's just like with everyone,

410
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,040
like you have one personality

411
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,920
and another personality

412
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,640
and there is a natural connection.

413
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,720
Sometimes it goes one way,

414
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,840
sometimes it's very intimate,

415
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,020
sometimes just very friendly,

416
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,080
it really depends.

417
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,760
And some of them are calling me

418
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,280
like 20 times a day,

419
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,360
some of them are calling me once a month.

420
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,280
And we have always, I book an hour

421
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,200
for each entrepreneur every week.

422
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,720
And they know they can cancel it

423
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,480
whenever they want.

424
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,800
I don't care, it's for them.

425
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,840
It's not for me, okay?

426
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,800
I get a free hour. It's fine.

427
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,440
Right.

428
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,280
So, this is something

429
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,040
which is really important

430
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,800
and those relationships

431
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,800
are also changing with time.

432
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,840
So, as we get to know each other better

433
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,040
we are becoming more intimate

434
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
and kind of like and different.

435
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,960
And this is something

436
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,880
which for me is important

437
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,480
because those are real relationship.

438
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,280
It's not something that

439
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,640
you just turn on and off.

440
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,880
It's like real friendships

441
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,840
and they're there forever.

442
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,240
One of the things that they know

443
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,760
is that I really do care,

444
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,040
and not just about the company,

445
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,840
but also about them personally.

446
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,960
I do believe that people and companies

447
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,160
are interconnected.

448
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,640
And I think that happy entrepreneurs

449
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,760
are better entrepreneurs.

450
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,560
And I really like entrepreneurs.

451
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,200
I invest and I insist on investing

452
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,360
in people that I like,

453
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,040
I really personally like.

454
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,160
So, we're going to have fun

455
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,520
working together.

456
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,000
That's amazing. Wow.

457
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,960
But how do you go about

458
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,120
the due diligence process then?

459
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,520
How do you find that connection?

460
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,440
Because even if you do get to meet them

461
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,440
a few times, I imagine that the scenario

462
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,520
through the limited experience

463
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,120
that I now have

464
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,840
with a venture fund that I work with,

465
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,120
you get to build some repertoire

466
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,760
and relationship with the founders,

467
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,680
but it's still in the context of

468
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,360
three or four meetings.

469
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,680
It's not like going camping with them

470
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,440
and seeing them in necessarily

471
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,800
in their true 100% colors, right?

472
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,720
So, it sounds like

473
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,880
there's a little bit of a challenge there

474
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,680
to really find that personal fit,

475
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,000
or maybe I'm wrong.

476
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,040
No, no, no. It is.

477
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,560
Listen, I invest many in seed companies

478
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,680
and I really like new markets, okay?

479
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,000
So, markets that do not exist yet.

480
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,400
The real problem in investing

481
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,600
if I think about it, so first of all,

482
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,040
and I love first time entrepreneurs,

483
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,480
so I think 70% of my investments are first timers.

484
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,640
So, I invest in people

485
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,760
that have no track record.

486
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,520
So, I can't check their track record

487
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,200
in markets that do not exist.

488
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,640
So, there is not a lot of point

489
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,520
talking to customers,

490
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,160
a lot of time they don't know

491
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,360
what I'm talking about even.

492
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,680
So, most of the time goes to

493
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,400
working with the entrepreneur.

494
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,720
So, it's weird.

495
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,080
So, really honestly,

496
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,000
my due diligence is very intuitive

497
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,080
and it's a lot about

498
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,280
how I feel about the people.

499
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,040
And if I think that

500
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,120
they are really bright, very open,

501
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,040
very transparent,

502
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,280
and we can work together

503
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,760
and I call it going together

504
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,200
to an adventure, because I know that

505
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,320
everything is going to change.

506
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,000
The reason for that change

507
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,520
is the group that is working together.

508
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,960
This is why I also like to invest a lot

509
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,520
in seed stage because

510
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,240
it's a very intimate relationship.

511
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,320
A lot of things are changing constantly.

512
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,280
I don't want them to feel uncomfortable

513
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,680
with them changing things.

514
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,680
On the contrary, I want them to move

515
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,640
and I want them to brainstorm with me,

516
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,080
they'll tell me that I'm wrong

517
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,880
or I'm stupid

518
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,680
and feel comfortable saying that

519
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,520
and insist on doing their own way

520
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
because they're the ones

521
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,160
who are going to be blamed eventually

522
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,920
if it's not going the right way.

523
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,680
So, they have to take the decisions.

524
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,720
There is a circle of

525
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,880
responsibility and authority

526
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,160
that has to be close together.

527
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,440
And so, it's really important

528
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,800
that they'll take the decision.

529
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,560
So, they need to be

530
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,320
very comfortable with me.

531
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,040
And not think that

532
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,240
I tell them what to do.

533
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,760
So, it's a combination.

534
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,800
I learn a lot about people

535
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,240
when I'm doing the negotiation

536
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,920
on the term sheet with them.

537
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,720
The way I'm doing negotiations

538
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,680
is actually very funny.

539
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,920
I come with the coffee table

540
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,040
and we play with it together

541
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,480
and I find it very fair deal

542
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,840
to everyone and with most entrepreneurs.

543
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,440
Wait, you come with the what?

544
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,280
What did you say?

545
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,880
We have an interactive coffee table.

546
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,720
So, we just come

547
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,520
and we just play with the numbers.

548
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,880
Okay, got you.

549
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,960
It's kind of like [--]

550
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,480
between two to three minutes, okay.

551
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,000
It really depends how long

552
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,040
because it's really easy.

553
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,120
Really?

554
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,400
Yeah.

555
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,240
Because I know that

556
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,280
I don't want to allude them too much

557
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,960
and they need

558
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,360
a certain amount of money

559
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,800
and we need some [--].

560
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,960
So, it's actually, everything about

561
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,800
a VC-entrepreneurs relationship

562
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,840
is actually really really simple.

563
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,560
And then you see

564
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,320
some entrepreneurs are just so happy

565
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,560
to see this approach.

566
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,600
And like in five minutes,

567
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,080
we close the deal and we move on.

568
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,680
And some entrepreneurs try to optimize.

569
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,200
And those entrepreneurs are usually shy away

570
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,840
because my kind of attitude,

571
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,440
you can't take advantage of me.

572
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,040
So, I take care, I work with people

573
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,240
that enjoy this kind of attitude.

574
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,080
It's like giving and they give back

575
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,240
and we just enjoy working together.

576
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,600
So, from time to time I make mistakes

577
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,720
but it's very rare, actually.

578
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,000
our workers are really greatful people

579
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,800
and they enjoy working.

580
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,800
Rona, that's just inspiring.

581
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,760
I can imagine my hand on the situation.

582
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,720
One set of the regular VC experience

583
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,360
that I think

584
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,600
every young entrepreneur imagine is

585
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,920
sitting coming with suits,

586
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,120
negotiating over a table,

587
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,140
sending emails in,

588
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,680
and over weeks trying to decide

589
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,720
on those two percentage points

590
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,760
here and there.

591
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,800
Whereas you come and meet

592
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,600
at a coffee shop,

593
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,040
do an interactive coffee table

594
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,480
and give a hug and continue the hug

595
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,840
before caorona times, of course,

596
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,400
and continue with the day.

597
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,840
Rona, I can't believe

598
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,880
20 minutes are almost over,

599
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,240
but I have two important questions

600
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,760
before we leave.

601
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,880
The first one is to me.

602
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,320
Something that a young entrepreneur

603
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,440
like myself or like a lot of my friends,

604
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,160
either from 8200 or Stanford,

605
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,440
what can we take with us

606
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,160
from this personal insight that you had

607
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,800
of being sort of a mensch

608
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,360
and being a good person

609
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,920
going throughout our career,

610
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,360
what is something that we can keep in mind

611
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,640
to try to do that with that aim?

612
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,240
So, first of all, believe.

613
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,920
Really believe in yourself

614
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,840
and believe that it's okay to be firm

615
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,120
and to be mensch and to be good.

616
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,720
And it's not like you're weak.

617
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,800
Sometimes people around us

618
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,680
will consider it weakness, it's not.

619
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,960
It's actually being strong.

620
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,840
And second, pick the right people

621
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,400
around you, okay?

622
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,840
You cannot be fair if you have people

623
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,360
that are over optimizing,

624
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,960
that are manipulating around you.

625
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,040
Pick the right people around you,

626
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,240
people that actually enjoy

627
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,840
this kind of culture

628
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,600
and everyone will have so much fun

629
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
working together.

630
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,800
Amazing. Amazing.

631
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,040
Rona, last one,

632
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,120
three words that you would use

633
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,600
to describe yourself.

634
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,160
There is this guy that I really like

635
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,480
in the Valley that looked at me

636
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,880
like a year ago and told me,

637
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,000
"You're such a strange bird."

638
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,800
So, this is my three words.

639
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,900
I love it. I love it.

640
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,330
Rona, toda raba.

641
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,320
Thank you very very much.

642
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,840
This was inspiring.

643
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,160
I just love getting to know you better.

644
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,800
And I look forward to coming one day

645
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,600
with my own idea

646
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,000
and potentially collaborating together.

647
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,840
This is just wonderful

648
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,440
what you're doing there.

649
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,900
Thank you.

650
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,350
Bye. Bye.
