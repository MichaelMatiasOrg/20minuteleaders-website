1
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,840
Eli Barak, thank you so much

2
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,400
for joining me.

3
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,440
How are you?

4
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,280
Good, how are you?

5
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,200
I'm great.

6
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,720
It's so fantastic to have you.

7
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,760
We know each other

8
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,880
for quite some time now,

9
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,520
for quite a few years.

10
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,080
All the way back from the robotics team

11
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,480
when you so generously came

12
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,680
and helped mentor our team,

13
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,400
a relatively rookie team.

14
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,360
And you've built some

15
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,520
really incredible, incredible

16
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,400
projects and mentorship

17
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,560
in ... Emek Hefer

18
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,800
and ...

19
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,640
So, tell me a little bit

20
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,880
about your journey.

21
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,760
Where do you come from

22
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,080
and how do you do that transition

23
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,120
from an entrepreneur and investor

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,480
to education and mentorship?

25
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
Yeah, so first of all,

26
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,880
thank you for having me.

27
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,600
I think that probably the best definition

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,520
is to say that I'm a serial entrepreneur.

29
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,720
Started in the software market

30
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,520
in the Israeli army.

31
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:43,080
Found myself focusing on software.

32
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,200
My first startup ...

33
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,760
first exit

34
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,480
was in the CRM EOP markets.

35
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,520
Moved to the states,

36
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,960
lived in the US for five years

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,560
with my family.

38
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,720
Came back to Israel

39
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,560
just before 9/11.

40
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,080
And decided that I need to find something

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,280
interesting to do once retired,

42
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,800
because the exit was good enough.

43
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,920
And after 18 months of doing nothing

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
and going to coffee shops,

45
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,320
you need to figure out

46
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,600
that you do want to do something.

47
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,440
And I found myself,

48
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,600
by coincidence I must say,

49
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,000
working with high school kids.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,320
And robotics is an interesting platform

51
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,160
not necessarily because the kids

52
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,840
will eventually focus on robotics

53
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,760
in their adult life, but rather

54
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,960
because it's a combination

55
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,000
of different disciplines including

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,320
mechanical engineering,

57
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,200
software, system engineering,

58
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,160
working in a team,

59
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,760
understanding and handling priorities.

60
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,640
So modern robotics, in a way,

61
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,920
is a great platform if you want

62
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,240
to work with kids

63
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:11,200
and start some kind of an excitement in them

64
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,960
to be part of the technology

65
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,120
market or technology world.

66
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,200
And this is basically what it is.

67
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,960
It's a trigger.

68
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,160
But Eli, before we get

69
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,800
deeper into the robotics,

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,560
I have to understand,

71
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,720
because most people who end up devoting

72
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,240
over 100% time towards

73
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,400
education and mentorship, they often come

74
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
from those types of backgrounds

75
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,840
that they've done that

76
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,800
for quite some time.

77
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,760
You're coming in as an entrepreneur,

78
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,960
investor, serial entrepreneur,

79
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,120
and you're saying all of a sudden

80
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,000
devoting 100% of your time

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,560
or 150% of your time to help mentor kids.

82
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,120
So, how does that work?

83
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,120
First of all, 100% or 120%

84
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,720
is a relative definition.

85
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,200
If you want, you have 26 hours a day

86
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,760
and you find time to do

87
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,120
things that you like. I kept doing,

88
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,360
and I'm still doing, a lot of work

89
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,840
with entrepreneurs, adult entrepreneurs.

90
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,720
What you find out and what attracted me

91
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,480
to work also with high school kids

92
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,880
is that, if you think about it,

93
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,320
this is the next generation.

94
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,240
You talk about the millennials now.

95
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,280
Even if they are now 15, 16 years old,

96
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,400
in 10 years they are

97
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,440
the next generation entrepreneurs.

98
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
So, even if you are focused

99
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,400
on entrepreneurs and startups

100
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:32,920
and you are looking

101
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,160
for the next generation,

102
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,360
you find yourself talking to kids.

103
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:44,600
They are very intuitive, very innovative.

104
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,680
So, I think that what you find out

105
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,360
when you work with kids

106
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,400
around those areas of innovation

107
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,040
and out of the box thinking is that

108
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,280
you can get great results

109
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,000
when you have mixed teams

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,520
of adults and kids.

111
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,880
And this is where I started ...

112
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,000
I can say that now about, what

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,120
20 years later,

114
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,280
I came back to Israel 20 years ago,

115
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,440
back from the states. 20 years later,

116
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
and now I'm working

117
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,400
with a lot of startups

118
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,960
that are combining,

119
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,080
and we talk about it later,

120
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,600
combining kids and adults.

121
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,080
It's a great combination,

122
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,880
because you have great ideas

123
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,760
coming from them.

124
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,080
Yeah, they are less mature of course.

125
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,960
They don't have all the

126
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,960
professional skills you are looking for.

127
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,880
In the same time,

128
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,400
they are very, very innovative

129
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,520
and are still capable of thinking

130
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,920
out of the box,

131
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,840
something that we are losing

132
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,000
as we are aging

133
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,280
and getting a profession.

134
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,800
Right.

135
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
And this is very interesting

136
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,200
for the ecosystem in Israel.

137
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,280
And we find,

138
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,680
I can point out now five companies

139
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,360
in the hub that we are running

140
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,360
in Emek Hefer where we have kids,

141
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,040
11 and 12th graders

142
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,840
that are part of those startups

143
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,880
just because they met each other

144
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,780
and are now involved.

145
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,560
Right. 100%

146
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,680
And I'd love to understand

147
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,600
a little bit better about this community

148
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,440
that you're building there.

149
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,440
So, what you're doing with Emek Hefer

150
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,480
is not what an ordinary robotics team

151
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,400
does in Israel or all over the world.

152
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,000
And it's gone beyond simply the six week

153
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,040
first robotics competition, right?

154
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,600
It's gone much beyond that.

155
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,960
So Eli, talk to me a little bit about

156
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,640
what is the community

157
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,400
within this education sphere

158
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,120
like FIRST...

159
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,200
and what you're doing there,

160
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,080
and then talk to me about

161
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,920
what you're doing outside

162
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,720
of just the FIRST program.

163
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,440
Sure. So, again, it's not a secret

164
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,200
that the traditional

165
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,040
formal education system,

166
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,240
the school system, is not working

167
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,720
or not working very good.

168
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,440
Now, with the covid-19 days

169
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,320
make it even more difficult

170
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,440
for that system.

171
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,640
But kids are looking

172
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,880
for something interesting to do.

173
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,240
Everybody is bored.

174
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,480
The typical answer you get

175
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,080
from a typical high school kid

176
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,400
that is coming back from school

177
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,520
and, "How was your day?"

178
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,800
And the answer is "boring"

179
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,600
or "okay" is the best you can get.

180
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,760
Like a very shallow okay.

181
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,120
And the idea was to try to build

182
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,240
some kind of an ecosystem that we

183
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,000
first of all, and before everything else,

184
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,440
will reignite, if you want, people

185
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,680
and make them excited

186
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,840
about their daily operations.

187
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,080
So, the whole idea was to create

188
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,240
some kind of an ecosystem,

189
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,760
some kind of an environment

190
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,240
where people could be excited

191
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,240
about ... are doing.

192
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,560
Put aside their age,

193
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,400
whether they are kids or adults.

194
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,640
And since I'm involved

195
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,920
for 30 something years in technology

196
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,400
and in the startup ecosystem,

197
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,760
we said, and we, me together

198
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,560
with another partner,

199
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,840
his name is Liran.

200
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,120
And we are partners here in Israel.

201
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,080
Both of us are coming separately,

202
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,200
but coming from the high tech sector.

203
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,280
And the idea was to create

204
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,720
some kind of a local,

205
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,440
if you want, domestic ecosystem

206
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,480
that will be part

207
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,280
of the community at large

208
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,080
if you want.

209
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,840
So, it's not only your neighborhood,

210
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,640
but it's the area around you.

211
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,680
I would say 20, 30, 40,

212
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,200
50 thousand people in that area.

213
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,720
Emek Hefer is an example.

214
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,920
The Hefer Valley here in Israel.

215
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,160
And try to bring content

216
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,480
or create an enabling platform

217
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,200
around entrepreneurship, innovation,

218
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,640
out of the box thinking,

219
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,320
not necessarily technology,

220
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,880
but technology is a great start

221
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,520
for many of those.

222
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,080
Put everything in place,

223
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,720
which means content, lectures,

224
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,760
you name it, put it there.

225
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,040
And allow them to consume, if you want,

226
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,160
the content and the place

227
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,960
and everything you put ... for them

228
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,160
when they need it and develop themselves.

229
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,840
So, we are mentoring

230
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,960
and we provide the space,

231
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,480
if you want, a hybrid solution

232
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,760
because it's a combination

233
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,040
of an open space, like we work together

234
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,720
with an accelerator

235
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,640
and a venture fund,

236
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,120
and we do all of those together.

237
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,240
But not in a predefined program that says,

238
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,200
"Well, welcome to our accelerator.

239
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,240
You have two years

240
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,520
and half a million dollars.

241
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,600
At the end, you need to be able

242
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,200
to fly or you crash"

243
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,080
Sometimes it works,

244
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,160
most of the times it doesn't work.

245
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,960
And the idea here

246
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,080
was to try and create the platform.

247
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,840
So, platform is a place to be.

248
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,280
Offices, maker space, C and C,

249
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,400
and you name it.

250
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,320
Everything that you need

251
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,480
to really make things

252
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,280
and not only think about them

253
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,960
if you want to do it.

254
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:15,760
Bring a lot of content from leading ideas

255
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,680
and CEOs of companies

256
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,720
that are coming and talking

257
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,120
to the future entrepreneurs

258
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,240
in different areas.

259
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,920
Do mentoring

260
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,480
and really bring mentors

261
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,160
that could take them forward.

262
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,200
And have a venture fund

263
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,120
to do small early stage

264
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,000
pre-seed, if you want, investments.

265
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,800
All of that is aiming now not only adults,

266
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,280
the usual entrepreneurs, but also kids.

267
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,720
Right.

268
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,920
Try to mix them.

269
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,080
I don't know how you call it in the US,

270
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,400
but in Israel, we have this spot

271
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,360
that you do like a ...

272
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Yeah.

273
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,320
So, I don't know what's the terminology,

274
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,040
probably the same way.

275
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,800
A melting pot, yeah.

276
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,320
So, this is the best description

277
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,000
of what we're trying to do.

278
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,280
You put in a lot of good materials,

279
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,560
good people, mentoring, location,

280
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,720
you do it very slowly.

281
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,920
You need to be,

282
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,680
not to try to expedite things.

283
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,960
You rather need to do it slowly,

284
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,800
and you start to see the community

285
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,880
really building in front of you.

286
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,120
And I can say that now,

287
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,600
in Emek Hefer here, three years later,

288
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,760
we have really a full place.

289
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,200
We have a waiting list of 10, 15 people

290
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,320
that are trying to join,

291
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,600
and we don't have any offices for them.

292
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,240
We have more than a hundred kids,

293
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,360
high school kids, that are involved

294
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,640
in any given ... today.

295
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,280
Yeah. More than a hundred.

296
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,320
Probably next year,

297
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
we are going to have more.

298
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,040
Covid-19 created a situation that,

299
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,800
as I said, school is boring.

300
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,320
Schools are now cooperating with us

301
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,920
and saying,

302
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,400
"Well, maybe the informal education

303
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,360
is not so bad, and it's interesting."

304
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,000
And they cooperate with us.
- Wow.

305
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,440
I'm really curious about

306
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,120
what do you see in that space?

307
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,920
So, when you take high schoolers,

308
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,560
and I'm a huge advocate of this myself,

309
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,160
but you take high schoolers

310
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,040
and you give them a different purpose

311
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,800
that's intrinsic, informal education,

312
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,160
that they actually get to build something

313
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,960
and provide a product given,

314
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,760
execute it on what they are learning.

315
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,560
What do you see

316
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,360
outside of the lab?

317
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,080
Do they change at all?

318
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,800
Are they more confident

319
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,000
in different areas?

320
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,360
So, great question.

321
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,720
I would say that the main,

322
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,200
think about it as a toolbox,

323
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,080
and you basically equip them

324
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,280
with a new toolbox for life.

325
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,160
I would say that 90% of the value

326
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,000
that we provide to those high school kids

327
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,840
is not technical at all.

328
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,520
It has nothing to do with robotics

329
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,080
or space or other areas

330
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,440
that we are supporting;

331
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,600
it's rather on a personal toolkit

332
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,280
of how to be part of a team,

333
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,160
how to integrate things, it doesn't matter

334
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,400
what kind of integration.

335
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,960
What we call system engineering,

336
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,720
processes, understanding of

337
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,760
how do you really manage

338
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,560
personal priorities.

339
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,120
And one of the interesting feedbacks

340
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,280
we are getting from kids

341
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,240
and from their teachers in school is that

342
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,480
once they finish the first year

343
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,320
here in our program,

344
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,000
they're coming back to school

345
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and everything in school

346
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,120
is very, very easy for them.

347
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,000
Really?

348
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,760
Yeah. They easily handle the timeline

349
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,840
and they do the tests,

350
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,360
and usually the grades are going up

351
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,440
although they spend

352
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,520
about half of their time here.

353
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,400
They are spending afternoons and nights

354
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,240
and the weekend,

355
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,120
and you need to really push them back out

356
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,320
because if it's up to them,

357
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
they spend every minute here.

358
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,640
It's a community for them.

359
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,240
So, all the friendships and everything.

360
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,440
It's like a youth movement, if you want,

361
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,000
which, by the way, is something

362
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,600
we are doing right now in Israel

363
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,920
with the Ministry of Education

364
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,640
and Ministry of Science,

365
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,760
turning all that type of operation

366
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,800
into a recognized youth movement.

367
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,200
It's going to be called Nesher,

368
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,680
which in Hebrew stands for

369
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,880
...

370
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:26,480
which is youth, something robotics
- Something robotics

371
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,920
And the whole idea is

372
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,840
to really recognize the fact

373
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,240
it is a youth movement

374
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,800
with everything involved.

375
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,720
So, personal skill sets, what they call

376
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,960
the 21st century skill sets,

377
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,480
is the best value they are getting.

378
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
Interesting to say that we see

379
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,040
a lot of activities around us

380
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,200
from different, the Ministry of Education,

381
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,000
the IDF, the Israeli Army,

382
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,800
are looking for those kids

383
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,240
not because they know how to do robotics,

384
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,680
but they are much more mature

385
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,560
in their understanding of how to work in a team.

386
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,480
We do find a lot of situations

387
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,240
where kids that were not the best ones

388
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,440
in high school are finding things

389
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,800
to really excel and do things here

390
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,680
and be leaders in different areas.

391
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,480
We work a lot with girls

392
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,360
and fighting very successfully

393
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,760
the situation where girls are not getting

394
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,360
into technology for different reasons.

395
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,760
This is not an Israeli problem,

396
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,280
it's a worldwide one.

397
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,440
Very successfully working with girls,

398
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,000
and really have mixed groups

399
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,520
working with different parts

400
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,280
of the Israeli society.

401
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,720
Charedim that are not really

402
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,400
into technology, and we are doing

403
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,240
very well with them as well

404
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,120
through the few connections we have.

405
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,920
So, the whole idea is using technology.

406
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,520
We are doing it especially with two,

407
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,520
if you want, programs or titles,

408
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,600
one of them you mentioned

409
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,680
which is robotics

410
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,000
and the FIRST organization.

411
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,200
The other one

412
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,600
is something that is developing

413
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,320
all over the world now

414
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,120
which is what is called the new space

415
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,320
or commercial space, applications

416
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,120
that are trying to or starting to look at space

417
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,760
not only as an

418
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,720
intelligence government type of area,

419
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,200
but rather commercial

420
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,600
or private sector that are looking

421
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
into those areas.

422
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,880
A lot of startups in Israel in this area.

423
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
We are using it

424
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
to attract kids to come to us.

425
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,280
So, we have now a mouse,

426
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,440
a simulator that we are building here,

427
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,800
in Emek Hefer, together with the kids

428
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,320
that are going, that is going to have

429
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,120
like an underground lava type

430
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,600
of whatever, and you're going to

431
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,800
have a mission to Mars

432
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
and a control room.

433
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,840
The whole idea is really trigger them,

434
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,640
bring them in. Once they are in,

435
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,640
we get them.

436
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,240
100%. But Eli I have to ask,

437
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,920
so at the end of the day,

438
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,720
you're running these programs,

439
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,000
but how do you do this at scale, right?

440
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,640
So as an entrepreneur,

441
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,720
serial entrepreneur and investor,

442
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,640
it's all about you create the value,

443
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,200
you find a product market fit,

444
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,560
you create an amazing experience,

445
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,960
now how do you replicate this

446
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,640
all over the world?

447
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,560
Because I'm convinced.

448
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,720
I went through some of these programs

449
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,080
with you, with your mentorship.

450
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,800
I know how incredible it is

451
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,840
and the tools that it gave me,

452
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,040
but how do you get every kid in the world

453
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,720
to have this experience?

454
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,880
So, it's a great question,

455
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,520
and it's a question

456
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,440
that we started asking ourselves

457
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,600
about three years ago

458
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,040
when we started the first location

459
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
here in Emek Hefer,

460
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,960
and we are six partners.

461
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,840
All of us, by the way,

462
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,480
are coming from the high tech sector.

463
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,440
So, this is not real estate for us.

464
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,720
The real estate part

465
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,160
is just an enabling platform.

466
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,200
And this was exactly

467
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,720
the question that we're asking,

468
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,920
"Is this operation some kind of

469
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,200
a one man or two man

470
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,120
or five man operation and that's it?

471
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,960
Or can you really replicate?

472
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,600
Can you really scale?"

473
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,040
It took us two and a half years

474
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,280
to really examine the model,

475
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,840
refine it if you want.

476
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,400
About a year ago, we started to work

477
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,560
on our second location

478
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,960
up in Emek Israel ...

479
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,880
We are now working on it,

480
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,720
building the new location over there

481
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,560
that will be location number two.

482
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,720
Hopefully we open around Pesach,

483
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,880
spring of 2021.

484
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,160
Wow.

485
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,360
We are already talking

486
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,960
about a third location

487
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,000
that is going to be somewhere

488
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,360
around Rehovot,

489
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,480
so little bit south of Tel Aviv.

490
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,560
The whole idea is to do it

491
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,080
outside of the big cities.

492
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,000
Do it in areas where people are looking,

493
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,680
you have good community,

494
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,240
high skills on one hand,

495
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,440
but people that are bored

496
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,400
or looking for interesting things to do.

497
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,440
And you could provide,

498
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,760
since you are out of the big city,

499
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,120
real estate is cheaper,

500
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,000
so you could do things

501
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,400
that you cannot do in Tel Aviv

502
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,840
or in major locations.

503
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,440
Like Emek Izrael now is going to be

504
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,160
all around space, and we are building now

505
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,320
a new planetarium

506
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,440
over the really sophisticated,

507
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,040
special telescope

508
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
that is a sun telescope.

509
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,640
So, not only a regular one.

510
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,560
A lot of development around this.

511
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,400
In Emek Hefer we do a lot

512
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,080
of robotics and agriculture,

513
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,000
which is something we could do here

514
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,600
because we have tons of areas around us,

515
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,520
and ...

516
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,280
are the easiest thing to do.

517
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:54,680
And yeah, I think that I would say,

518
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,400
even on something which is important,

519
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,280
you learn very early that if you want

520
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,840
to have this smoothly working,

521
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,040
it cannot be based on philanthropy.

522
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,720
It must be a business model.

523
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,440
Now, why is that?

524
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,480
Why do you think that is?

525
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,120
Because long term,

526
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,000
it's very easy to get donations, funds

527
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,040
to build something,

528
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,440
but it's basically impossible

529
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,280
to keep getting those donations

530
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,760
to operate it.

531
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,360
Right.

532
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,560
So, you must, in a way,

533
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,840
come with a plan

534
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,480
that will be not only sustainable,

535
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,560
and fund itself, but be profitable.

536
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,000
Otherwise,

537
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,800
you don't have the funds you need

538
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,520
to really do the investments

539
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
at the beginning.

540
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,560
And this is exactly ...

541
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,000
It took us about two years

542
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,280
to make sure that we understand

543
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,400
how to make it profitable.

544
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,000
Now, don't get me wrong,

545
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,800
profitable while still understanding

546
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,960
that there are impact aspects

547
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,920
for your investment.

548
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,320
Community is important,

549
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,000
so it's not only maximizing

550
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,800
the return of the investment

551
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,120
in terms of funding and money,

552
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,040
it's also in community value.

553
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,320
The model needs to be sustainable,

554
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,680
it needs to be profitable,

555
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,120
and once you do,

556
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,600
you could do whatever you want.

557
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,880
And very interesting to say

558
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,760
another thing, the government,

559
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,720
the different agencies,

560
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,320
and I'm not blaming them,

561
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,040
are never first adopters.

562
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,560
They are not.

563
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,120
They tend to join in later

564
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,920
if you could prove that what you're doing

565
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,640
is really working and sustainable

566
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,280
and bringing value.

567
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,080
Right.

568
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,760
Once you do, they're eager to join,

569
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,000
because this is a success

570
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,880
and they could ...

571
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,760
And I'm not cynical.

572
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,880
What I want to say is that

573
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,360
this is the way it works.

574
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:44,800
Yeah.

575
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,120
So, once you do it,

576
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,240
I met yesterday the minister of science,

577
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,880
Yizhar Shai, and he came to Emek Izrael

578
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,520
to see what we are building over there.

579
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,240
And now the Ministry of Science

580
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,320
is supportive, and we are getting money

581
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,880
for different things we want to do.

582
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,640
But this is only after we proved

583
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,760
that we are able to bring money,

584
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,960
do what we need, or in a way

585
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,920
we just ...

586
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,400
... say about banks,

587
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,120
the bank wants to lend you money

588
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,160
only when you don't need it.

589
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,440
So, in a way, similar here.

590
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,080
You need to be on your own,

591
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,920
be able to support your ideas,

592
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,120
and prove that it's working.

593
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,840
Everybody else will join you later on,

594
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,300
which is fine.

595
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,120
Eli, this is insightful and inspiring.

596
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,920
I just love what you're doing there,

597
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,560
and I have no doubt

598
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,960
that it'll continue to scale.

599
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,080
And I know the impact

600
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,400
that you personally had on me

601
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,600
and Emek Hefer,

602
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,320
and the ... had on myself

603
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,000
and my friends,

604
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,880
and I'm watching everybody also

605
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,000
in the ... where I served.

606
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,200
I pretty much recognize everybody

607
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,360
from these amazing community,

608
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,280
and it really is a youth movement

609
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,360
just around technology

610
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,200
less about camping.

611
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,280
It's a different youth movement.

612
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,880
Eli, before we go, I need three words

613
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,640
that you would use to describe yourself.

614
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,880
Yeah, this is always interesting

615
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,400
to look back and think about it.

616
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,040
I would say probably

617
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,120
I'm very focused in everything I do,

618
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,520
and people that are working with me

619
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,960
know it. Some kind of a combination,

620
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,920
I usually say that I'm a tall person.

621
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,920
I'm not very tall, not at all,

622
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,160
but tall in the sense of

623
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,720
your head needs to be up in the sky.

624
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,200
You need to be a visionary.

625
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,800
You need to think about big things,

626
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,880
envision in long term, otherwise

627
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,360
you don't have really your direction

628
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,080
and the big picture.

629
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,320
In the same time, you need to be

630
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,680
very connected to the ground.

631
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,800
You're feet need to be

632
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,600
well connected to the ground

633
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,640
and need to be into the details.

634
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,120
There is a phrase that somebody used

635
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,920
that says:

636
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,480
"Think big and act small"

637
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,520
I really believe in this.

638
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,400
I think that we need to,

639
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,040
and I'm trying to be strategical,

640
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,120
think strategy in everything I'm doing,

641
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,240
which I think is a good combination

642
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,000
to describe me.

643
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,600
Some kind of emphasis on strategy

644
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,120
together with very practical

645
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,640
approach to life,

646
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,560
and I believe that the combination

647
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,440
is what makes it not only interesting,

648
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,480
but I will allow myself to say successful.

649
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,160
Eli, toda raba raba.

650
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,520
This is wonderful, and I can't wait

651
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,800
to come visit the greater space.

652
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,680
And it's just incredible

653
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,320
the work that you're doing.

654
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,720
So, thank you very, very much.

655
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,480
My pleasure.

656
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:32,920
Thank you.
