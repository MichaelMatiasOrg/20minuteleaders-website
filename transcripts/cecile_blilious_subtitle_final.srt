1
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,320
Cecile Blilious, thank you so much

2
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,600
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,240
How are you?

4
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,880
I'm great.

5
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,840
Thank you for having me.

6
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,440
It's such a pleasure.

7
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,920
Of course. I've been waiting for so long

8
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,440
for us to do this discussion

9
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,440
because you're running impact investments,

10
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,360
both part of Pitango,

11
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,920
but really throughout your whole life

12
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,960
you've been all about impact.

13
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,080
Whether it's working

14
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,600
helping evaluate ADHD through technology

15
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,160
or helping create investment opportunities

16
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,040
within the Arab sector in Israel

17
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,400
through Pitango.

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,040
So much to talk about, Cecille.

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,360
And I'd love to then

20
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,440
allude the conversation

21
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,480
towards more holistically speaking

22
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,520
about what it means to have an impact

23
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,240
and be an impact entrepreneur

24
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,360
on your side of the table

25
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,040
an impact investor.

26
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,840
But before we do that,

27
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,960
Cecile, who are you? Who's Cecile?

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Well, very short.

29
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,240
I was actually born and raised in France.

30
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,640
Came to Israel as a child.

31
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,960
Spent my whole life here

32
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,240
and went through the whole cycle:

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,760
education, army, and university, etc.

34
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,400
I've always been an entrepreneur

35
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
in everything I did.

36
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,560
And somehow life led me to become

37
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,840
founder and manager

38
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,240
of some startup companies.

39
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,360
Got into the hustle of the dot-com bubble,

40
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,600
in and out.

41
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,640
And after that, was very lucky

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,080
to join the Noaber Foundation,

43
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,560
which is a foundation

44
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,960
that focused on the early, early stages

45
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,800
of impact investing,

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,600
or what we now call impact investing.

47
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,160
So, I've really done

48
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,600
so many interesting things

49
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,720
and it's been a hell of a ride.

50
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,800
And I try to reinvent myself

51
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,160
every 10 years or so,

52
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,400
so it makes it ...

53
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,920
I love that. I love that.

54
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,480
Let's start with talking about

55
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,160
what is impact investing,

56
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,440
and then maybe we can dive deep

57
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,800
into some of the different projects

58
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,400
you've worked on and are still working on

59
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,400
and always draw back on how that fits

60
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,360
into the bigger picture

61
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,520
of what does impact investing mean.

62
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:32,880
Sure.

63
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,520
So, first of all, impact investing

64
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,120
has a Wikipedia definition.

65
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,920
It's really the intentional use

66
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,840
of investments in order to create

67
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,840
a positive change to society

68
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,560
or to the environment.

69
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,360
Now, because it's impact investing,

70
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,080
we're talking about financial returns.

71
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,520
Of course, it can be different kinds

72
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,280
of financial returns.

73
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,760
It can be lower or higher.

74
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,160
It can be market trade financial returns.

75
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,680
It could be any asset class

76
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,880
that you could choose.

77
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,080
And really, impact investing

78
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,440
is about everything we do.

79
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,560
What I specialize in

80
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,880
and really care about very much

81
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,520
is impact tech investing,

82
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,200
which is something that still

83
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,720
is very, very much in the, I would say,

84
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,640
in the shadows of impact investing.

85
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,440
Because if you look at

86
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,240
the whole the impact investing market,

87
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,680
you'll see about $715 billion invested

88
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
in 2019.

89
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,880
Only two billion out of that are tech.

90
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,000
How is that possible?

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,960
I mean, how is that even

92
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,640
Really?

93
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,480
Yes, just think about it.

94
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,840
With all the problems

95
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,640
that we are facing in humanity

96
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,960
and our planet,

97
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,760
with the sustainable development goals

98
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,760
which were designed and defined by the UN,

99
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,440
which really are an opportunity

100
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,400
of about $12 trillion from now until 2030,

101
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,520
how is it possible that we haven't thought

102
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,920
about blending high tech into impact

103
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,680
and blending impact into high tech?

104
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,280
So, really impact investing

105
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,920
is about doing good and doing well

106
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,480
in the most basic sense of the word.

107
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,360
So Cecile, I want to get a misconception

108
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,640
out of the way,

109
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,440
because when we talk about impact

110
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,960
and creating a positive change

111
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,880
in the world, immediately I think

112
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
most people draw their mind

113
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,320
into nonprofits, charity work,

114
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,960
donating money to help others.

115
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,320
You don't really think about business

116
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,880
and you don't think

117
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,160
about financial returns,

118
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,760
which is part of the responsibility

119
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,560
of an investor, right?

120
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,440
At the end, you want to see

121
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,880
returns on your investment.

122
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,440
At the same time, you're talking about

123
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,680
making a positive contribution

124
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,840
to the world.

125
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,760
So, give me a little bit of context

126
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,600
as to how these things

127
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,160
don't necessarily have to collide.

128
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,680
Yeah. So first of all, making an impact

129
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,160
is something that is very broad.

130
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,520
Impact is a word in the dictionary.

131
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,360
You can make an impact

132
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,320
by giving money away,

133
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,600
you can make an impact by helping people,

134
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,480
and you don't necessarily have

135
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,640
to blend returns into that.

136
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,440
However, impact investing really means

137
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,240
that you want to blend those two.

138
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,480
And actually when you are creating

139
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,080
a solution to a problem,

140
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,560
you need to look at the problem

141
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,880
in a few different lenses.

142
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,000
One is the business lens, okay.

143
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,040
So, you're creating a product

144
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,600
which is a solution for a product,

145
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,200
for a, sorry, for a problem.

146
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,880
And the solution you're creating

147
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,840
is a business solution.

148
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,040
It has to have a big enough market,

149
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,360
it has to have a big enough opportunity,

150
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,720
and a way to the market

151
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,680
that makes sense with your product.

152
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,320
Next to that,

153
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,880
if you look at the same product

154
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,160
or the same problem

155
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,480
in social and environmental lens,

156
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,240
and you define it by thinking about

157
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,560
who your stakeholders are

158
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,280
and who are the people

159
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,840
you're trying to really serve,

160
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,160
then you can very easily tweak

161
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,200
your product and your business

162
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,680
in a way that is very, very focused.

163
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,800
This way you can really blend the two

164
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,520
in a sense that you don't think about

165
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,920
creating a business solution

166
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,200
and then adding some sort of impact into it

167
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,320
which might be a hurdle

168
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,040
and might not fit what you're doing

169
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,960
or might force you to maybe

170
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,880
hire people you didn't want to hire

171
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,200
or locate yourself in a place

172
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,280
you didn't want to be located.

173
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,080
Instead, it really has to be

174
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
within the DNA of the solution

175
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,200
that you're creating.

176
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,120
Now, if you're a tech entrepreneur,

177
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,560
and you see a problem

178
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,840
that you'd like to solve,

179
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,000
and you can see this problem also

180
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,680
as a social problem, and you can understand

181
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,080
who are the people who are going to be

182
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,960
the beneficiaries or the stakeholders

183
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
that you're going to serve

184
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,880
through serving, addressing that problem,

185
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,280
then obviously you're going

186
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,680
to be able to blend the two

187
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,480
in a way that maximizes profits

188
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,000
because the more you sell your product,

189
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,960
the more revenues you'll have.

190
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,480
But also, the more people

191
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,280
who use your product,

192
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,360
the more impact you'll make.

193
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,000
So, the integrated approach

194
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,920
is what I'm looking for.

195
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,480
100%. You know one of the things

196
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,960
that I became extremely curious about

197
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
as I transitioned to my time

198
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,280
from the IDF towards now, Palo Alto,

199
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,000
and thinking about the things

200
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,040
I want to create is, I thought

201
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,720
there are so many different places

202
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,380
around the world where

203
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,680
a lot of the technology and

204
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,480
a lot of the projects

205
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,960
that I'm seeing people work on

206
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,680
are very focused on the US market,

207
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,600
for example, or

208
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
consumer products within Palo Alto.

209
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,240
And I'm thinking ... if

210
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,320
we could only leverage

211
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,800
some of this technology outside

212
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,960
to some developing areas.

213
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,160
For example, helping create sustainability

214
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,760
for a billion people in Africa.

215
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,760
And maybe you're not gonna charge a

216
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,960
$15 a month service fee

217
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,120
for another consumer product,

218
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,400
but if you're able to improve their lives

219
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,080
even a little bit

220
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,800
and have them contribute a little bit

221
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,680
to the product,

222
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,400
you can become just as profitable

223
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,160
as another unicorn in Palo Alto.

224
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,280
And that's definitely something

225
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,360
that I've been thinking about

226
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,880
what types of projects I want to work on.

227
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,400
But Cecile, I want to touch a little bit

228
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,640
on your tangible experiences

229
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,480
that you've had, both as an entrepreneur

230
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,280
and as experience.

231
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,160
Maybe you can draw back

232
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,840
to the company you ran

233
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,400
helping diagnose ADHD and helping that

234
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,200
or through investments in the Arab sector.

235
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,560
All right. So, first of all,

236
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,600
I wasn't the manager.

237
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,560
I was the investor of this company.

238
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,400
And also, with regards to the ... fund,

239
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,800
which was the first fund in Israel

240
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,840
that investing ... entrepreneurs,

241
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,920
that was also, the idea was

242
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,040
to initiate and make it happen

243
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,040
and not necessarily run it.

244
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,880
It's really about disrupting markets.

245
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,440
So, it's really about looking at a problem

246
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,520
in a different lens

247
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,880
and seeing underserved populations

248
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,280
or underserved opportunities.

249
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,960
Take the example of the Palestinian

250
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,480
or the Arabs in Israel who are,

251
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,800
until about 10 years ago,

252
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,040
they were totally excluded

253
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,160
from the high tech sector.

254
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,840
Now, it doesn't mean that

255
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,360
they are not good entrepreneurs

256
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,200
or have amazing ideas or ... the talent

257
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,640
and the ability and the stamina

258
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,840
and everything you need in an entrepreneur

259
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,920
to create really great companies.

260
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,280
However, the paradigm was that

261
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,480
these people are just not part

262
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,160
of the game.

263
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,680
The network isn't there,

264
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,360
the understanding of how

265
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,760
business works isn't there,

266
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,400
the access to capital isn't there.

267
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,520
There's a language barrier,

268
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,720
there's all kinds of stigmas and paradigms

269
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,960
that we needed to break.

270
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,360
Now, having said that,

271
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,120
20% of Israel's population is Arab.

272
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,240
So, how is it

273
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,640
that 20% of the population

274
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,360
does not participate

275
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,600
in that particular high tech sector?

276
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,640
It just doesn't make any sense

277
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,880
when the high tech sector

278
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,160
really needs good people,

279
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,440
good entrepreneurs, good engineers,

280
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,280
people with the ability

281
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,320
to even access markets

282
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,520
that Israel cannot access

283
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,240
like the Arab speaking markets.

284
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,720
So, and there you have it.

285
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
The opportunities there,

286
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,840
but nobody's looking at it

287
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,640
because it's too complicated.

288
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,400
It seems that

289
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,520
you won't be able to succeed.

290
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,200
You have this, again,

291
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,240
paradigm in your head

292
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,160
that you might not be able

293
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,600
to communicate well.

294
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,320
But actually, when you drop all of these,

295
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,040
then you can really find

296
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,160
good opportunities.

297
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,120
So, same goes with thinking

298
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,440
about a problem in a different way.

299
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,880
So, the entrepreneurs that created

300
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,920
the ADHD solution looked at the way

301
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,040
that ADHD is being diagnosed

302
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,160
in a totally different way

303
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,720
and just decided to try to pick up

304
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,280
on these computerized tests

305
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,440
that children go through anyway

306
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,160
and think about that in different ways

307
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,360
of how ADHD is actually manifested

308
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,320
in the brain, but also in behavior.

309
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,960
And then blend the two

310
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,640
and come up with a solution that is easy,

311
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,920
easy to implement,

312
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,480
easy to use to screen,

313
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,960
and therefore easy to address,

314
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,080
because it's not a disease.

315
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,640
So we're not talking about treatment;

316
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,520
we're talking about how to help

317
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,200
people with ADHD really achieve the goals

318
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,840
that they're trying to achieve

319
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,600
with the condition that they have,

320
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
which is ADHD,

321
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,080
and can really be a huge benefit

322
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,240
and not necessarily a hurdle.

323
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,520
So, it's really about redesigning

324
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,400
your thought process about a problem

325
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,600
or redesigning a solution.

326
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,160
Now, I do want to go back

327
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,720
to your previous assumption.

328
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,800
You talked about Africa

329
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,640
and about developing markets

330
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,280
and how would it be so amazing

331
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,640
if you could just take these technologies

332
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,360
that are applicable in Palo Alto

333
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,680
and just apply them in emerging markets.

334
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,000
And that is absolutely very, very true,

335
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,960
and these are, again,

336
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,480
underserved markets, etc.

337
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,120
But, you're falling into the same paradigm

338
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
that people think about

339
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,480
when they think about impact.

340
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,840
Immediately their minds takes them

341
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,640
either to think about philanthropy

342
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,760
or thinking about emerging markets.

343
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,880
But, you know what?

344
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,240
Is there poverty in the US?

345
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,600
Is there inability

346
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,880
to access good education

347
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,760
in the US or in Europe?

348
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,320
Is there a problem of gender equality?

349
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,160
Is there a problem

350
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,440
of equal opportunities in cities?

351
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,680
All these problems exist everywhere.

352
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,720
So, when I think about

353
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,000
an impact entrepreneur

354
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,400
or somebody who comes in

355
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,720
with a solution to a problem,

356
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,920
I don't really care what kind of geography

357
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,720
he's addressing or she's addressing.

358
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,440
Actually, I think that we, as investors,

359
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,960
unless we have a clear focus

360
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,480
on a certain geography or a certain sector,

361
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,800
we shouldn't interfere

362
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,440
with what the entrepreneurs come up with.

363
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,280
And if they think that their market

364
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,320
is based in Germany, then so be it.

365
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,960
If they think their market is in India,

366
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,080
amazing.

367
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,760
But we need to make sure

368
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,840
that the entrepreneurs

369
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,320
understand the problem,

370
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,440
they understand the solution,

371
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,560
they understand their competition,

372
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,000
the market, and they're able

373
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,080
to deliver a solution,

374
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,320
which is tech based in our case,

375
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,160
to address that problem.

376
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,960
So, in a way, you see that

377
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,520
even you are stuck in the same paradigm

378
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,640
of thinking about emerging markets,

379
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,640
and a lot of people are there as well

380
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,440
when looking at the

381
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,880
Sustainable Development Goals,

382
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,920
this beautiful design

383
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,440
of these 17 very colorful designs

384
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,000
of the SDGs.

385
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,240
And immediately people say,

386
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,960
"Oh yes, but this is emerging market.

387
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,840
It's not me."

388
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,720
But that's absolutely not true.

389
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,280
Right. 100%.

390
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
And I do have to say that,

391
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
my personal thinking process

392
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,160
through this is saying,

393
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,440
Okay, as an entrepreneur,

394
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,400
I want to maximize on the impact

395
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,120
that I create with every hour

396
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,840
that I work, right?

397
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,880
And I'm thinking, of course,

398
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,080
there are lots of issues,

399
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,040
and what's been happening

400
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,480
in the United States and Israel

401
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,400
and all over the world in the past year,

402
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,720
especially Black Lives Matter

403
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,920
and the Me Too movement.

404
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,120
It just brings up

405
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,400
a lot of these inequalities

406
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,520
and a lot of these issues.

407
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,200
But at the end of the day,

408
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,880
I'm thinking if I have a set of skills

409
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,960
that I can leverage

410
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,320
towards building a technology

411
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,600
that can help others,

412
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
I want to try and help those that are

413
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,400
as far off from the norm

414
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,360
that I consider as sustainable

415
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,680
and as equal.

416
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,840
And at that point, that was my thinking process,

417
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,520
but I completely, completely agree.

418
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,760
And I'm assuming that

419
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,240
that is also a contributing factor

420
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,160
to why a lot of people

421
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,480
aren't considering too much

422
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,480
going into impact entrepreneurship

423
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,960
because they think,

424
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,040
okay, if impact that means

425
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,440
I have to go to the emerging markets,

426
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,160
but I want to be in Israel

427
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,840
or I want to be in Europe,

428
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,800
so I shouldn't even try.

429
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,960
And Cecile, that brings me

430
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,440
to my next question, which is

431
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,360
how do you personally explain

432
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,320
that such a small fraction

433
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,800
of the funds go towards impact investing?

434
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,400
Or why is there such a small fraction

435
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,720
of impact entrepreneurs

436
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,080
in the tech sphere?

437
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,760
Because I'm completely shocked

438
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,560
by the number that you gave me before.

439
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,160
All right. So, first of all

440
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,160
I think there's much of it

441
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,080
with what you just said,

442
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,560
that people really automatically think

443
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
about either philanthropy

444
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,760
or emerging markets or things

445
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,200
that they don't really do

446
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,000
in their daily jobs,

447
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,520
and therefore it's not for them.

448
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,920
But except for that,

449
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,920
when I think about impact,

450
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,320
I think about DNA of an entrepreneur

451
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,200
that's looking at a problem

452
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,360
and is trying to address it.

453
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,320
It's an interesting thing

454
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,840
that a lot of the entrepreneurs

455
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,240
are actually addressing

456
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,480
the Sustainable Development Goals,

457
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,760
only they don't know it.

458
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,760
As a matter of fact,

459
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,480
if you look at Israel as an example.

460
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,800
So Israel has about 6,600 startups

461
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,400
at any given moment. From research

462
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,680
that's been done last year,

463
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,880
about a third of them are actually,

464
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,200
indeed addressing one, at least one

465
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,640
of the Sustainable Development Goals.

466
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,240
Only either they don't know it,

467
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,960
or they don't know what to do about it,

468
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,760
or they don't understand

469
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,080
how that has anything to do

470
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,320
with how they talk about their business.

471
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,400
Or, even worse, they think that

472
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
if they're going to be talking

473
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,480
about the problems or the social aspect

474
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,600
of what they're doing,

475
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,640
then their investors

476
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,000
are going to be saying,

477
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,360
"Oh, maybe they're not going

478
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,760
to maximize profits.

479
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,100
Maybe we shouldn't touch it.

480
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,560
Maybe it's philanthropy"

481
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,520
blah, blah, blah.

482
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,320
So, I divide my world into two categories:

483
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,040
one is the impact natives,

484
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
and one is the impact migrants.

485
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,400
The impact natives are the ones

486
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,080
who are really born into

487
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,240
It's like natives, Internet natives,

488
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,200
okay? So, it's basically your generation, okay.

489
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,720
It's people who understand it very deeply,

490
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,920
who see the world in a very holistic way,

491
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,040
who understands that actually

492
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,040
when you look at a problem

493
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,400
or anything you do in life,

494
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,120
it's always about everything.

495
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,480
There is no like,

496
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,560
you don't live your life in silos, right?

497
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,280
You don't think to yourself,

498
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,040
okay, now I'm this person who is at home

499
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,200
and then I'm this person goes to work,

500
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,560
and later I'm the person

501
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,440
who goes out with my friends for a beer.

502
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,240
You think about yourself

503
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,520
as one holistic human being, right?

504
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,440
And you do all these things

505
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,240
with the same values

506
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,040
that you carry with you everywhere.

507
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,080
Same when you're a company.

508
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,280
Then if you're a native,

509
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,040
somewhere in your stomach,

510
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,800
it feels that you're doing something

511
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,920
that is good for society

512
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,720
or for the environment,

513
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,560
only you might not know

514
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,240
what to do about it,

515
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,200
and you will need some help of somebody

516
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,720
who will help you verbalize it,

517
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,000
measure it, track it, etc. However,

518
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,920
it's a given, right, you don't think about it.

519
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,440
Impact migrants, on the other hand,

520
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
which is the majority of the market,

521
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,960
and I'm talking about investors

522
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,160
and the entrepreneurs

523
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,840
and everything in between,

524
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,800
these are the people

525
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,880
who actually do have something

526
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,040
with the Sustainable Development Goals,

527
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,960
but again, they might not know it

528
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,760
and they might need the support

529
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,000
of an investor or a consultant

530
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,560
or someone who will come to them and say,

531
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,520
"Okay. You know what?

532
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,680
Let's look at your product

533
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,880
with a different lens

534
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,720
and think about the stakeholders

535
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,440
that you're serving

536
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,000
when you're selling your product,

537
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,400
and then blend the two

538
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,600
in a way that's integrated.

539
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,960
And let's see if that's actually

540
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,040
within your DNA and your intention."

541
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,000
And you'll find

542
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,520
that the majority of these people

543
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,320
actually were somehow natives,

544
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,920
only they even didn't know it.

545
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,320
So, with a good process of migration,

546
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,360
you can really migrate them

547
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,320
into understanding what is the impact

548
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,560
that they're going to create,

549
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,040
which sustainable development goals

550
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,560
they can target,

551
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,920
how that is really embedded

552
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,520
into their business in the sense that

553
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,120
when you take their business results

554
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,680
and you look at them

555
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,480
through the stakeholder eyes,

556
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,440
then you can really understand

557
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,760
how that impacts the world.

558
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,680
And of course, measurement is key.

559
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,720
So, if you don't measure,

560
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,800
you obviously don't know what you're doing

561
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,400
and you don't know if you're improving.

562
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,240
And obviously when you measure,

563
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,880
you have to measure the net impact,

564
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,000
so not only the impact

565
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,760
that you're creating,

566
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,440
but also consider the potential

567
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,960
negative impact you're making

568
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,920
and discount it, and understand

569
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,240
if you're not really creating

570
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,280
by helping one, you're actually,

571
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,780
let's save 20 monkeys

572
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,600
and destroy the forest, maybe not.

573
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,560
So, all these things

574
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,440
are need to be considered.

575
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,720
So, at the end of the day,

576
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,400
it's a profession,

577
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
and you need some professional help.

578
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,800
But migration is where we can really tap

579
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,360
into the mainstream VCs

580
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,880
and the mainstream entrepreneurs,

581
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,800
and you'll find out very quickly

582
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,560
that these people are totally on board.

583
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,560
And they're on board for various reasons:

584
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,240
one is because they care about it,

585
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,280
but two, is because they want to hire

586
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,520
the best talent, okay.

587
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,600
So, you're not going to be working for a VC

588
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,720
or for a startup that doesn't have that

589
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,280
embedded into what they do.

590
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,600
You're not going to buy their products.

591
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,240
You're not going to invest in them.

592
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,000
So, for whatever reason,

593
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,920
it's going to come

594
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
and it's going to come fast, okay?

595
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,160
Just remember that your generation,

596
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,920
the millennials,

597
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,080
are going to be inheriting

598
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,560
$30 trillion in the next decade.

599
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,120
And you do care about these causes,

600
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,320
so I think you're going to make

601
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,640
a big difference.

602
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,600
100%. And it's definitely become

603
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,880
very, very evident that people,

604
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,760
when they're looking to join

605
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,480
different opportunities,

606
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,600
they're not just asking

607
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,640
what is the company doing,

608
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,000
but they're looking for the mission

609
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,800
behind the company.

610
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,040
So, definitely mission driven.

611
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,720
It's definitely something

612
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,880
that I see for myself, 100%,

613
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,200
but also for a lot of my friends,

614
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,320
both from the IDF and from Stanford,

615
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,280
that's something that it's

616
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,400
constantly talking about

617
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,160
how is this making a better impact.

618
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,800
In the last minute or two that we have,

619
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,640
I'd love to understand a little bit better

620
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,360
the work that you're doing

621
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,600
within Pitango now, one of,

622
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,840
I believe Israel's largest

623
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,000
venture capital fund.

624
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,840
You're running impact and sustainability.

625
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,000
Paint me a picture a little bit

626
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
of the process that you're working.

627
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,360
So, as you have startups

628
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,160
that are coming to you,

629
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,800
how do you even begin to assess

630
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,720
on a due diligence process

631
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,440
if they're making a positive impact,

632
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,960
and like you're saying, also assessing

633
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,120
the negative impact

634
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,320
they might make inadvertently?

635
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,920
Yeah. So, first of all,

636
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,800
I'm super proud of Pitango

637
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,440
and their decision to embed

638
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,920
and integrate impact metrics.

639
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,200
We call the ESG to SDG Continuum Strategy.

640
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,240
And I think this is

641
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,760
like so innovative and pioneering,

642
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,320
Aad I believe that within a year or two,

643
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,520
everyone else was going to want

644
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,880
to do this because why not.

645
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,760
We're not compromising

646
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,720
any financial returns.

647
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,880
We're going to make, to create

648
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,680
much better companies.

649
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,320
Why wouldn't anybody,

650
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,640
like everybody should do it.

651
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,760
So, how does it actually happen?

652
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,880
First of all, I work with

653
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,520
the existing portfolio companies

654
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,320
of Pitango to think about

655
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,120
how they integrate impact

656
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,040
into what they're already doing.

657
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,200
And I'm talking about

658
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
early stage startups,

659
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,760
but also unicorns.

660
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,720
Just to give you an example,

661
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,440
I'm working with Via, which is a unicorn,

662
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,960
that is doing shared riding,

663
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,400
and I'm looking at their business results

664
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,520
and what they actually do

665
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,560
in terms of providing transportation,

666
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,280
which is affordable and accessible,

667
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,560
and how that impacts their stakeholders.

668
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,120
Of course it makes money,

669
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,600
but it also makes an impact.

670
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,200
And we make an analysis,

671
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,280
and we make a measurement.

672
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,120
Next to that, early stage startups,

673
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,040
like even Zapata,

674
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,320
which is a quantum computing company

675
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,440
that is looking at influencing

676
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,520
how material is being developed

677
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,040
and how drug discovery is done.

678
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,640
I mean, just think about the impact,

679
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,500
the positive impact, that can be done

680
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,720
with quantum computing.

681
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,840
Now, with companies

682
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,480
that are approaching us, first of all,

683
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,400
we'd like to have as many

684
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,560
impact native companies

685
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
as possible approach us,

686
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,600
which they might not have

687
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
before I joined the team

688
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,880
because they might not have thought

689
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,200
that Pitango would be interested.

690
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,000
And then, we are going through

691
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,280
an assessment of thinking about their ESG,

692
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,840
so that's really the baseline,

693
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,560
and do no harm, of course.

694
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,800
Then we try to assess

695
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
which are the indicators

696
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,320
in the Sustainable Development Goals

697
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,880
that are relevant to their product

698
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,160
and try to see how that integrates

699
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,640
into our due diligence process.

700
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,360
So, I keep repeating that word

701
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,680
like integration, integration.

702
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,400
It's really about integrating

703
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,000
the impact into the business.

704
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,080
And when we do diligence,

705
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,720
we do the questions together.

706
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,240
Then when we analyze it,

707
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,120
we try to figure out in advance

708
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,760
what is going to be the impact

709
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,360
and what can be

710
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,920
the potential negative impact.

711
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,560
And we talk about it with the companies,

712
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,760
and we try to get them to face it.

713
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,880
Now, it can be something as trivial

714
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,400
as not having enough diversity

715
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
in your team.

716
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,920
And it can also be something that says,

717
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,760
"Okay. If I deploy this product,

718
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,560
everybody else is gonna be out of a job."

719
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,560
So, how do we make sure that we take care

720
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,040
of the stakeholders and keep them in mind

721
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,400
and are transparent about our decisions

722
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,680
in a way that really makes

723
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,720
a positive impact.

724
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,880
Cecile, this was just wonderful.

725
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,960
I gained so much inspiration

726
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,040
for myself as an entrepreneur,

727
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,920
and I hope that my friends watching this

728
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,840
and the conversations that will evolve

729
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,240
as a result of this discussion.

730
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,560
I'm very excited

731
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,320
to where things are headed,

732
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,720
and I'm extremely excited

733
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,040
to approach you one day

734
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,280
with hopefully an impact native company

735
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,520
and work together.

736
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,920
But Cecile, before we go,

737
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,160
I have to ask you for three words

738
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,400
that you would use to describe yourself.

739
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,840
Yeah. So, you know what?

740
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,840
You asked me in advance

741
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,520
and it's really tough.

742
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,880
But I didn't give you enough time,

743
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,160
so this is not a hard commitment.

744
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,560
... off the top of my head. So number one, I'm a relentless optimist.

745
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,400
I know it's two words,

746
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,280
but it is what it is.

747
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,120
There's a hyphen in there,

748
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,580
so it's one word.

749
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,400
... absolute optimist.

750
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,480
I always believe that things

751
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,040
will work out well.

752
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,440
Number two, I really am a believer.

753
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,080
I believe that people are good,

754
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,200
and they're going to want

755
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,160
to make this change

756
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,000
and make this migration

757
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,360
and that eventually impact

758
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,760
will just go back into the dictionary

759
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,520
as a word and everything we do

760
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,440
is going to have an impact

761
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,160
and a positive one.

762
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,480
So, maybe I'm a little bit naïve

763
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,760
to compliment the believer part,

764
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,800
but that's really who I am.

765
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,520
And the last thing

766
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,040
which I think is critical,

767
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,440
and we should all, I think, adopt it,

768
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,760
is I try to be very, very authentic.

769
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,800
So, I practice what I preach.

770
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,640
I really try my best to be very true

771
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,560
about what I preach to the industry.

772
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,080
And this is something

773
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,400
that without authenticity,

774
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,240
we're going to see

775
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,120
a lot of impact ...

776
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,240
and a lot of marketing usage of impact.

777
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,080
And I think this is a risk

778
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,640
that we can't take.

779
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,880
We have to be authentic

780
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,240
about our intention

781
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,960
and the way that we practice what we do.

782
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,600
In a way, it's a hard thing to do

783
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,920
because you have to be accountable

784
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,480
for what you do all the time,

785
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,840
but this is just part of my DNA.

786
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,520
Cecile, toda raba, thank you so much.

787
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,920
This was just wonderful. Thank you

788
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,080
for being so generous with your time.

789
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,160
I know how busy you are.

790
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,880
And stay safe and stay healthy.

791
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,800
Thank you, Michael.

792
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,880
And really be careful

793
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,320
with all these fires and stay healthy.

794
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,080
Take good care,

795
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,920
and let's make a lot, a lot of impact.

796
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:12,400
100%. Bye bye.
