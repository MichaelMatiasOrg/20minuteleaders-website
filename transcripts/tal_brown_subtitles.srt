00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,400
Tal Brown,  Zone7,

2
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,480
thank you for joining me.

3
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,360
My pleasure.

4
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,400
Thank you for having me man.

5
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,920
You know, it's so cool because in all

6
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,600
my social media, I wrote you

7
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,120
on all my contacts as Tal Brown Zone7

8
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,880
and your Zoom link says that as well.

9
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,040
So, from now, like your company

10
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,000
is attached to your name.

11
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,560
It's a part of your identity.

12
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:06,960
You know why?

13
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,400
Because I read somewhere a while ago

14
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,400
that to add your company name

15
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,000
to your Google account name will mean that

16
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,520
every time somebody sees an e-mail

17
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,000
or you log in, it will say,

18
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,040
Tal Brown Zone7.

19
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,720
So, I did that and I forgot about it.

20
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,000
And now it's everywhere.

21
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,480
And now you can never rebrand

22
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,080
no matter what do you do.

23
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,920
For me, you're gonna be

24
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,080
Tal Brown Zone7.

25
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,600
Tal, what is Zone7?

26
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,160
What is this thing?

27
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,560
Zone7 is software,

28
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,000
that is artificial intelligence software

29
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,800
that helps you make decisions about

30
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,560
how hard to push yourself physically.

31
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,160
When to rest.

32
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,480
When to train harder.

33
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,040
With the objective of

34
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,480
performing at your peak for longer.

35
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:49,880
Right.

36
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,600
And in sports, it means less injuries,

37
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,360
dramatically less injuries.

38
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,480
Staying in that peak shape

39
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,120
for longer and longer periods.

40
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,040
Amazing. So, for me,

41
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,120
that's a fascinating field.

42
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,280
My girlfriend just finished at Stanford.

43
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,960
She actually just won

44
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,160
the national championship

45
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,080
in soccer as a striker.

46
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,960
And I know that that is very

47
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,920
relevant to what you're doing.

48
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,840
And it's very relevant

49
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,000
because one of the main things

50
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,840
that she was telling me

51
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,840
was that it's incredible how many

52
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,240
injuries they have on the team.

53
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,320
And she's explaining to me

54
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,200
how they pushed them physically

55
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,360
throughout the trainings.

56
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,080
And honestly, it's not that surprising

57
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,360
that half of her team

58
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,520
is constantly in some sort of injury.

59
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,520
But, Tal, tell me about zone7.

60
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,800
How do you use AI and software

61
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,400
to help reduce the injuries?

62
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,760
Well, when somebody gets injured,

63
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,280
something breaks down.

64
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,040
Maybe they were pushed a little bit

65
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,400
beyond their limit for that day. Right?

66
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,680
And your limits change, right?

67
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,320
You could do something on a Monday

68
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,800
you couldn't do on a Tuesday.

69
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,200
And it's really hard to figure out

70
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,280
that limit because it changes

71
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,360
from day to day.

72
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,880
And it depends on a lot of stuff:

73
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,080
It depends on your sleep,

74
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,400
and on your nutrition,

75
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,760
and on your current workout

76
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,000
and previous workout,

77
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,720
how well you recover it

78
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,480
and all that stuff.

79
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,760
And so, for one person looking after

80
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,040
20, 30 athletes, like a soccer team,

81
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,200
solving that puzzle

82
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,920
for every single player every day

83
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,600
is really complicated.

84
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,280
And as a technology

85
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,560
in the technology sector,

86
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,760
there's a couple of things we've done

87
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,320
over the years to help.

88
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,000
The first thing is to collect data.

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,200
So, we've helped collect data.

90
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,640
We've got sensors on the backs of

91
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,480
soccer players and basketball players

92
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,400
and hockey players

93
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,200
that measure movement and running,

94
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,160
sprinting and jumping.

95
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,200
So, we're collecting data

96
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,680
about sleep as well and all that stuff.

97
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,720
The second thing we're doing is

98
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,080
we're helping visualize the data.

99
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,720
So, we've got all the Excel,

100
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,680
spreadsheets, and we've got the CRMs,

101
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,920
and we've got the tableaus.

102
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,080
We can plot every single parameter

103
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,840
that we have about you.

104
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,920
But what we haven't done really well

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,960
is to enable accurate interpretation

106
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,120
of the data.

107
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,640
Right.

108
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,280
And what I mean is that,

109
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,040
what is your trend mean today?

110
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,320
How does that relate to

111
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,240
other soccer players of your age

112
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,120
that have been injured in the past?

113
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,280
Right.

114
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,240
What should you do?

115
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,680
It's not just about red flag.

116
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,200
You know, we should give you advice

117
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,880
on how to tweak your training.

118
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,440
How far can we push you

119
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,760
without breaking you?

120
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,480
You know, I love this so much because

121
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,200
I was an athlete myself.

122
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,440
I played varsity tennis and volleyball

123
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,360
in high school.

124
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,000
And one, I think it's not just about

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,160
a trainer being accountable

126
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,680
and looking at the 20 players

127
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,440
and measuring them on a daily basis

128
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,600
and knowing how to push them.

129
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,920
But the promise that you're attaching

130
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,680
emotions into the training.

131
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,360
And when you have a game coming up,

132
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,960
you may be blinded

133
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,880
by putting in the extra effort.

134
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,920
Yeah, what are the chances

135
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,720
they can handle it?

136
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,760
They're just crybabies.

137
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,520
They can do it.

138
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,880
When you're talking about software,

139
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,240
and when you're talking about just data

140
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,000
that's giving the feedback.

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,120
It doesn't take into account

142
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,480
that you have a game tomorrow.

143
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
It merely looks at the statistics and says,

144
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,520
based on your current assessment,

145
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,280
you're prone for an injury, right?

146
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,720
Yes and no.

147
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,480
So that the cold data

148
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,480
does not understand schedules

149
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,280
and does not understand emotion.

150
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,080
But today what we do is

151
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,120
it's not just about the data.

152
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,920
It's about understanding

153
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,480
your weekly schedule.

154
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,560
Is this a Tuesday?

155
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,320
Is this a Wednesday?

156
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,320
Is this a Thursday?

157
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,520
Are you playing on a Saturday?

158
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,440
Who are you playing?

159
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,600
What's a typical game against

160
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,120
those opponents look like for you?

161
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,360
What are the demands that we think

162
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,440
you will need to do

163
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,400
in order to win on that game?

164
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,000
So there's that context.

165
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,000
And in soccer specifically

166
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,500
it's called the Microcycle.

167
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:33,640
A weekly cadence of getting ready

168
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,280
for a game on the weekend.

169
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,120
Basketball's a bit different.

170
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,800
Baseball as well,

171
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,680
because they're playing more.

172
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,640
But it's the same principle.

173
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,640
That's basically making sure

174
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,720
you're peaking for a game

175
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
and then letting you recover

176
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,000
and train hard in between.

177
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,280
And as for emotions.

178
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,320
I do not like to speculate

179
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,760
about emotions but

180
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,720
today you've got products

181
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,640
that are available

182
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
for a couple of hundred bucks

183
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,200
that take very good measure

184
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,160
of your recovery,

185
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,680
of your stress,

186
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,560
of your heart rate

187
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,120
when you're resting or sleeping.

188
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,640
And that doesn't differentiate

189
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,720
being angry versus being upset

190
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,000
versus being sad.

191
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,520
But it does measure very accurately

192
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,560
how your body is responding

193
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,560
when you're not training.

194
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,340
So, we can call it

195
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,920
recovery data or wellness data,

196
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,600
but it is hard data.

197
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,160
And if we understand what a

198
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,960
typical recovery for you looks like,

199
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,360
that allows you to perform

200
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,520
a really good game.

201
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,040
Then we can see if you're there or not.

202
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,280
And we can help calibrate that

203
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,640
on a day to day basis.

204
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,440
Tal, coming from somebody who doesn't

205
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,560
really follow sports actively,

206
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,400
now I'm following because of Carly.

207
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,840
But for somebody who's not

208
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,040
really following actively,

209
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,480
it doesn't seem like injuries

210
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,240
are that prevalent.

211
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,960
Because I'm seeing Messi

212
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,400
go on the field every game

213
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,760
and Ronaldo is playing every game.

214
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,120
And so, but I know that it's a big deal

215
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,040
because you're going after

216
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,360
a big market and therefore,

217
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,520
I trust you.

218
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,920
But Tal, give me a little bit of a rundown.

219
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,840
What is the scope of injuries

220
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,280
that we're seeing today in sports?

221
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,720
So, I think you're getting a biased view

222
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,200
of how big the problem is

223
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,760
just because of your,

224
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
maybe it's also timeline,

225
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,240
because of covid,

226
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,720
less sports in North America.

227
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,760
But you look at what's going on

228
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,040
in the UK, in Europe right now?

229
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
Dozens of players are

230
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,800
down with injuries.

231
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,360
Arsenal had seven injuries

232
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,200
in like two weeks of games.

233
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,760
These are devastating, right?

234
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,880
The difference between

235
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,600
winning and losing over a season

236
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,920
can be one or two injuries.

237
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,720
And you look at Messi,

238
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,840
there's a little study that

239
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,720
sometimes I referred to,

240
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,480
he was down for about six weeks,

241
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,840
I think it was two years ago.

242
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,560
But if you look at the number of points

243
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,600
per week that Barcelona were able to get

244
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,080
with and without him, it's measurable.

245
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:49,520
So, about 20 to 30% of a soccer squad

246
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,400
is out every given moment.

247
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,680
Really? 20 to 30%?

248
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,960
And is that mostly stress related?

249
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,560
Or is that mostly,

250
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,960
because of collisions and whatnot?

251
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,360
So, it's basically about two thirds,

252
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,720
70% are what's called

253
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,480
soft tissue injuries.

254
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,720
So, not contact related.

255
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,280
Wow.

256
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,320
So, pulling your hamstring,

257
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,320
tearing your ACL, groin, ankle

258
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,680
and some of it is contact.

259
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,520
But I'll tell you this.

260
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,240
Contact injuries,

261
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,040
while we cannot predict what happens

262
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,560
when two people collide fast

263
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,840
on a soccer pitch or a hockey ice rink,

264
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,000
contact often aggravates

265
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,120
an existing issue.

266
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,760
Huh.

267
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,000
So, not to say it's predictable,

268
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,160
but to say that if you can quantify

269
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,880
how strain certain things are,

270
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
then the likelihood of contact

271
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,960
to bring you over the tipping point

272
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,440
for an injury is greater.

273
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,480
So, it's a huge problem

274
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,640
and it's huge in sports.

275
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,960
You look at the NBA finals last year.

276
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,240
Determined on both sides,

277
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,680
by one side being extremely healthy,

278
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,360
on the other side being

279
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,560
extremely unlucky after five years

280
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,560
of phenomenal success with injuries.

281
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,960
But for us as a company,

282
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,000
sport is a first market.

283
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,760
If you look at a wider field

284
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,640
of employers and employees,

285
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,960
people who are under physical

286
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,640
and mental stress for living,

287
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,800
that market is even bigger, right?

288
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,040
Messy, you wanna help messy.

289
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,440
You wanna help Durant.

290
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:22,840
You wanna help Tom Brady.

291
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,960
But ultimately, you've got doctors

292
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,720
working under extremely difficult

293
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,680
mental conditions in hospitals.

294
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,000
You've got oil and gas workers

295
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,200
under a lot of stress.

296
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,280
You've got manufacturing, factories.

297
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,480
That's actually the point.

298
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,320
So, for us, that's the horizon.

299
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,400
And we're already deploying

300
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,080
using our success in soccer

301
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,040
and hockey and baseball

302
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,320
to deploy into environments

303
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,480
like ERs and still working plans.

304
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,600
I have to say that is so cool.

305
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,960
When we met for the first time

306
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,680
a few months ago,

307
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,440
and I was so inspired

308
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,040
by what you're doing.

309
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,960
It's because I was reflecting back

310
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,160
on my experience in the

311
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,040
Eilat Desert Marathon of 2017.

312
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,600
And it's such a monumental moment for me.

313
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,320
Both because I managed to finish it,

314
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,360
but also, because

315
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,120
it was a disastrous moment for me.

316
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,120
Because since then

317
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,640
I've been dealing with knee problems.

318
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,840
And almost every person

319
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
that I talked to told me,

320
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,320
"Michael, you're gonna injure yourself."

321
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,440
"You don't know what you're doing."

322
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,120
"You're gonna push your

323
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,120
body past what it can do."

324
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,920
I had no contact injury.

325
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,600
I didn't mess up at any point.

326
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,800
I finished the marathon.

327
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,000
I was feeling great.

328
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,280
I went into my ice bath

329
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,520
and I couldn't get up.

330
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,440
My body just couldn't handle the stress

331
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,080
of running all that distance.

332
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,240
And I think to myself

333
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,120
that when I said emotions before,

334
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,040
that was my mental state that

335
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,760
I was ignorant enough to not listen

336
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,160
to the doctors and the therapists

337
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,160
because I thought

338
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,240
I didn't really believe them.

339
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,120
But if I had data that showed me,

340
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,200
Michael, based on your training

341
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,720
and based on the training of others

342
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,600
who got injured in long distance running,

343
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,400
we think you're at risk.

344
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,160
I think that that would give me much

345
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,440
more confident than listening

346
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,440
to a trainer who I think might have,

347
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,760
maybe something against me

348
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,040
or doesn't really want me to succeed.

349
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,520
So, I think trainers

350
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
are extremely important.

351
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,080
Because ultimately,

352
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,880
software doesn't understand you.

353
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,840
We don't hear your voice.

354
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,680
We don't understand your emotions.

355
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,440
There's a lot of stuff we don't capture.

356
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,720
Not to say we can't.

357
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,480
So, we're really helpful

358
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,160
with the data stuff.

359
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,920
But ultimately, a trainer is important.

360
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,680
It's kind of like a pilot, right?

361
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,760
Inventing GPS did not

362
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,040
get any pilot fired.

363
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,360
It just gave him a really good

364
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,280
navigational tool.

365
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,680
Instead of looking at the stars

366
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,800
as they're crossing the Atlantic

367
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,440
trying to figure out

368
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,480
if this is the right way.

369
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:25,720
Right.

370
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,920
So, trainers will continue to be there.

371
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,760
But we're just gonna give them

372
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,960
better and better tools.

373
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,600
And in a sense of detecting risk,

374
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,040
they're gonna have a compass that's gonna

375
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,960
be super accurate all the time.

376
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,400
That's where we're headed, right?

377
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,960
We're not gonna get rid of trainers.

378
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:39,920
But we will get rid

379
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,160
of certain grey areas

380
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,040
where people make biased decisions.

381
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,040
Think about stock trading, right?

382
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:48,960
30 years ago,

383
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,680
probably stock traders would have said,

384
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,400
"There's no way computers could do this

385
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
better than we could."

386
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:53,760
Right?

387
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,120
And today nobody on his right mind

388
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,480
would consider not using some

389
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,920
kind of automated system to that.

390
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,040
So, sports is changing as well.

391
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,760
A little bit slower or a little bit after

392
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,560
some other industries,

393
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,960
but it's gonna happen.

394
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,000
Tal, I think that's so cool.

395
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,320
I wanna hear about your background.

396
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,040
How do you get to do something like this?

397
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,440
You move from Israel to Palo Alto,

398
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,200
a part of UpWest Labs that are

399
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,120
so kindly sponsoring the series.

400
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,000
I mean, how do you even get

401
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,080
to build an AI software for sports?

402
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,320
So, my story is somewhat unique

403
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,120
in the sports technology field.

404
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,920
I'm not a sports guy.

405
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,440
I didn't play. I didn't train.

406
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,960
I didn't treat players. Didn't manage players.

407
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,600
I spent my early careers

408
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,000
in Israel's [--]

409
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,640
creating big data products

410
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,440
for the intelligence community.

411
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,320
Then I spend some time at Salesforce.

412
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,160
I was one of the first

413
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,400
product managers at Salesforce

414
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,880
to work on predictive technology.

415
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,120
This isn't a time where 2012, '13,

416
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,240
nobody wanted to hear about this.

417
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,120
I was kicked out of meetings

418
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,320
for about a year.

419
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,520
We will never do AI.

420
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,800
We're not that kind of company,

421
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,000
Go back to your dreams in Tel Aviv.

422
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,680
And the world changed.

423
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,070
And I was on that journey with Salesforce.

424
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,360
So, I learned how to create products

425
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,110
that use machine learning to help,

426
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,760
I would say non-technical people,

427
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,790
not scientists or engineers,

428
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,270
do their job better and faster.

429
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,310
How do you measure

430
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,550
the success of this product?

431
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,240
How do you build it?

432
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,960
How do you craft it?

433
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,080
How do you visualize recommendations

434
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,160
to a user who is not a scientist?

435
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,240
Right.

436
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,350
So, I did that for a living.

437
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,750
And it was a great journey,

438
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,400
Salesforce is an incredible company.

439
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,270
And then I tell you, the stars aligned.

440
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,480
I wanted to do my thing.

441
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,440
I wanted to start a company.

442
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,560
I met my co-founder

443
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,360
who is a sports scientist,

444
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,480
a phenomenal talent.

445
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,160
And we had a pilot.

446
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,160
We had two pilots in Israel, right?

447
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,520
And if you know Israel, you know,

448
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,120
there's a lot of good

449
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,840
stuff about Israel.

450
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:55,030
But it's not a sports superpower.

451
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,680
It is not a sports superpower.

452
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,440
That is definitely not.

453
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,080
But we got lucky.

454
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,590
We got lucky because one of the only

455
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,440
real sports VIP is in Israel,

456
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,270
Jordi Cruyff,

457
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,320
who used to coach Maccabi

458
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,310
and is a very famous soccer player.

459
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,640
He was coaching the team

460
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,680
that we had a pilot with

461
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,960
and he saw it and he said,

462
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,880
"Oh, this is working."

463
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,120
"Contrary to what I was led to believe

464
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,680
my entire life about soccer injuries."

465
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,040
And he said,

466
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,080
"All right, I'm going to help you guys."

467
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,920
"And I'm going to join the company

468
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,000
as an adviser investor."

469
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,120
And the next thing that happened

470
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,240
was meeting UpWest.

471
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,000
And basically, it's glad

472
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,240
they're also sponsoring me.

473
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,880
They were the first firm,

474
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,840
the first investor to say,

475
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,560
"This could be big."

476
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,110
"We believe in this."

477
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,560
"You're gonna play by our rules."

478
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,880
And that means get yourself

479
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,800
to Silicon Valley,

480
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,920
spend some time with us here,

481
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,030
because the more time you spend

482
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,200
in the market you wanna grow in,

483
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,830
the more likely you are to succeed.

484
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,960
It's not a guarantee.

485
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,830
It's just, it just makes sense.

486
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,310
So, I literally quit my job.

487
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,060
Signed a paper with UpWest.

488
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,840
And a couple of days later,

489
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,350
I was on a plane.

490
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,920
And I left my wife and my two kids

491
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,000
in Israel for four weeks at a time,

492
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,440
coming to here to work,

493
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,070
to connect, to build the company.

494
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,400
Really?

495
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,720
Yeah. So, I did like pretty brutal,

496
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,070
like army style.

497
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,240
Like four weeks [--]

498
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,840
to one or two weeks at home

499
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,440
for about 18 months.

500
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,350
And then once we gonna got us,

501
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,120
Yeah. So, the big hero here

502
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,680
is my wife.

503
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,840
And we can do a whole podcast

504
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,360
about my wife.

505
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,270
Of course.

506
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,520
And then 18 months later

507
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,720
we had a seed round.

508
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,080
And I relocated the entire family

509
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,720
to Palo Alto.

510
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:44,550
So, it's been a crazy journey.

511
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,120
Somewhat crazy in the sense

512
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,800
of like just living really weird life

513
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,480
for a while.

514
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,720
But I've seen the company grow,

515
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,510
which is phenomenal.

516
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,030
I'm seeing more investors coming in.

517
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,680
I'm seeing more success.

518
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,440
So, I gotta say, the UpWest thesis

519
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,880
is definitely something that I believe in

520
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,160
very strongly.

521
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,000
Tal, that's just incredible.

522
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,680
And your daughter goes

523
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,840
to the same elementary school

524
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,560
that I went to,

525
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,200
which is the most exciting part

526
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,240
of this whole conversation,

527
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,200
I have to say.

528
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,760
Because I have such a phenomenal

529
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,440
childhood here across the street and

530
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,560
No dragon.

531
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,560
No dragons. And I'm actually

532
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,520
I'm really jealous of her.

533
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,440
The handball wall

534
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,560
there is two handballs.

535
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,480
And that's where I spent

536
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,640
my entire elementary school.

537
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,040
So, if she ever needs tips

538
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,960
on how to win there.

539
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,480
I know all the dirty tricks of this game.

540
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,400
Well, this kid came into here last summer,

541
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,030
didn't speak a word of English.

542
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,520
And yesterday she read to me

543
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,320
Green Eggs and Ham

544
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,830
right before she went to bed.

545
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,440
So, we talk about AI in sports.

546
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,160
But kids have it just like that.

547
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,200
Effortless learning.

548
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,320
I think it's a wonderful gift

549
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,030
that you are giving her.

550
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,160
For me, growing up more of an

551
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,240
international background

552
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,160
and going back and forth

553
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,070
and having both the Israeli mindset,

554
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,480
but also, the American mindset.

555
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,920
They complement each other

556
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,640
with all their differences.

557
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,640
That I think it makes for something

558
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,440
very very special.

559
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,560
If you want, I can do the Israeli interview.

560
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,520
But up to you.

561
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,510
Exactly. Tal, reflect with me

562
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,480
on the startup journey.

563
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,960
Now that you have great traction,

564
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,600
you're going and you're deploying

565
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,590
this in different spaces.

566
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,920
I didn't even know that you're going now

567
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,550
into places that are not just sports,

568
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,920
which is I think it's incredible.

569
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,960
What advice would you give

570
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,880
to young entrepreneurs,

571
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,310
perhaps young entrepreneurs

572
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
out of [--].

573
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,040
They're working on

574
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,080
building their software.

575
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,920
Their market may be here,

576
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,960
but it's not that easy to make the move

577
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
and pick up the family

578
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,790
and go to Silicon Valley.

579
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,520
So, what advice would you give

580
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,160
to these entrepreneurs?

581
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,240
Well, I'll say a couple of things.

582
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,360
First of all, I did this a little bit later

583
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,110
in my career.

584
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,160
So, on one hand, I had a family

585
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,680
which was a great great force

586
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,200
of stabilization for my life.

587
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,840
On the other hand,

588
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,560
I had more tools in my first

589
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,070
professional toolbox.

590
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,520
I work in Salesforce.

591
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,920
I was a PA and I did sales before.

592
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:07,040
So, I had maybe to tell you

593
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,400
but a little bit differently than

594
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,520
if I would be like 25, 26.

595
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,790
So, I would say this, first of all,

596
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,840
don't be scared to spend

597
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,840
another couple of years in your career

598
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,070
working for a company.

599
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,960
Just be sure to spend it

600
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,120
where you think would be

601
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,070
the most ROI for your future.

602
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,680
So, don't just go to a job,

603
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,480
work with friends.

604
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,160
Because we're the guys from the middle

605
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,790
and whatever.

606
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,520
Know, and so many people

607
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,350
I feel are looking for jobs

608
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,280
because of the difference

609
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,440
in a few thousand dollars a year.

610
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,790
Look, it's like chess.

611
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,480
You don't have to look

612
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,360
15 years down the road.

613
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,640
Look three years down the road.

614
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,080
What's gonna best prepare you

615
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,200
for that next thing?

616
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,680
And for me,

617
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,590
the product management experience

618
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,000
and the Salesforce experience

619
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,360
as an American innovative company.

620
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,520
That was huge for my career.

621
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,160
So, that's one.

622
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,310
Plan a little bit ahead.

623
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,680
Don't be scared to work

624
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,600
for a couple of years.

625
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,320
Nothing's gonna happen.

626
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,520
I started my company, let's say,

627
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,920
more than 10 years after I finished

628
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,440
more [--]

629
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,200
So that's one.

630
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,960
Number two is, aim big.

631
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,550
Go to the US. Right?

632
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,830
Our place is a phenomenal fund.

633
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,350
They're not the only way to do it.

634
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,480
But the more time you spend here,

635
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,480
your thinking is going to change.

636
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,920
It doesn't mean an Israeli ecosystem

637
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,830
is not a phenomenal.

638
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,880
But regardless of the identity

639
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,360
of your investor,

640
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:24,600
come to the US

641
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,120
spent as much time as you can here.

642
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,040
It's really weird in the beginning,

643
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,000
but it pays dividends later.

644
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,520
I'm sure.

645
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,590
And the third thing is really,

646
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,000
it's obvious but it's so true.

647
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,400
It's resilience.

648
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,720
You've got to be prepared.

649
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,830
You're gonna be in a mental space

650
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,720
where you're okay with

651
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,920
getting slapped on the face

652
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,800
or getting rejected 100 times a day.

653
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,480
Not to say that happens every day,

654
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,960
but it does happen occasionally.

655
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,790
So, you've gotta be on your feet.

656
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,120
You've gotta be happy in the journey.

657
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,310
And you've gotta push forward

658
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,680
because there will be hard days.

659
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,920
You gotta be ready for it.

660
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,640
You've gotta want it right.

661
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,200
So, resilience is really important.

662
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:09,280
And like I use it, somewhat a metaphor,

663
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,000
A sword doesn't become strong

664
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,640
just because it's a sword.

665
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,280
It becomes strong

666
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,040
because it gets hit

667
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,440
with boiling hot hammers

668
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,640
a thousand times.

669
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,160
So, 10,000 times.

670
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,520
So, that's how you forge a sword.

671
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,720
So you've got it.

672
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,920
That's the process.

673
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:26,480
Tal, I love it.

674
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,110
20 minutes go by so fast.

675
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,920
I have to know the most

676
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,640
important question,

677
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,080
three words that you would use

678
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,590
to describe yourself or

679
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,280
that Shuly and Gil, our friends

680
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,200
would use to describe you.

681
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,720
So,  I'll say, Dad.

682
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,200
I'll say Third Culture Kid as one word

683
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,070
because it's one concept.

684
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,080
And I'll say,

685
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,360
well, good one.

686
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:57,550
I think Courageous as a word,

687
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,320
not that I'm great

688
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,720
but I’ve learned to jump in the water

689
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,720
when it's really hard.

690
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,310
That's the most important I think.

691
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
It's incredible.

692
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,880
And I mean that's the trade

693
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,000
that allows you to go and explore

694
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,760
whatever you wanna do.

695
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
All right Michael.

696
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,920
Good luck with your journey.

697
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,960
You're doing phenomenal work.

698
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,240
And thank you UpWest for sponsoring this.

699
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,040
Tal, toda raba. Really amazing.

700
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,920
And I can't wait for dinner in August,

701
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,320
September, whenever that happens,

702
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,240
whenever this whole thing comes down.

703
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,040
All right. Take care. See you soon.
