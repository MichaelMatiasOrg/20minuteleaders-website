1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,439
And so, I asked our teacher

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,919
after this whole exercise,

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,079
how do you actually go about

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,079
changing the world?

5
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,079
Like, tactically speaking,

6
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,239
what are ways to embody that message?

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,159
And he told me,

8
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,359
"Ben, one of the best ways

9
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,120
to change the world

10
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,350
is to be an entrepreneur."

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,039
Ben Casnocha, thank you so much

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,559
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,039
I am so thankful to have you here.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,079
Thank you for being so generous

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,039
with your time.

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,199
Thanks for having me, Michael.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,839
It's a pleasure to have you.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,839
We have way too much to talk about.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,010
I want to just run forward.

20
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,268
And considering everything

21
00:01:02,468 --> 00:01:02,999
that you've done,

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,359
which is incredible,

23
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,919
I'd love to hear about Village Global,

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,342
I'd love to hear about your work

25
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:09,325
with Reid Hoffman

26
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:11,126
and the two New York Times best sellers

27
00:01:11,326 --> 00:01:13,412
that you wrote and the different insights

28
00:01:13,612 --> 00:01:15,039
that you've gained into helping

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,359
young entrepreneurs on their journey.

30
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,266
The majority of the audience

31
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:17,719
for this show

32
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,200
is young entrepreneurs like myself,

33
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:20,519
just starting their journey.

34
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,279
And I think that going back and relieving

35
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,240
some of these lessons that you

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,680
so thoughtfully highlight

37
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:27,119
in a lot of your writing,

38
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,519
that will just be incredible.

39
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,240
So Ben, how about you take me down

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,600
memory lane, just walk me through

41
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:33,519
some of the really cool things

42
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,399
that you've gotten to take a part of.

43
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,159
And we'll touch on some lessons

44
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,919
here and there from there.

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,520
And, I'll of course, interrupt

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,440
when I'm especially curious.

47
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,480
When I was 12 years old,

48
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:45,350
I took a class in school

49
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,999
that was a computer repair class.

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,839
And so, we learned how to fix and repair

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,187
Macintosh computers

52
00:01:51,387 --> 00:01:53,719
as an elective course at my school.

53
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,719
And it was designed, of course,

54
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,277
to allow the school to use us

55
00:01:57,477 --> 00:01:59,119
as child labor to repair all the

56
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,239
school computers when they broke.

57
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,184
But I learned a lot about

58
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:03,344
how to fix computers

59
00:02:03,544 --> 00:02:04,639
in a really helpful class.

60
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,679
And at the end of the semester,

61
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,920
we had a final exam.

62
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,679
But the final exam was very different

63
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,319
than any other exam I've taken.

64
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,547
The teacher announced that

65
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:14,597
all we would have to do

66
00:02:14,797 --> 00:02:16,173
to get an A plus on the exam

67
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,416
is memorize and recite a poem

68
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,440
back to him perfectly.

69
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:21,999
And if we could do that successfully,

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,479
he would give us

71
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,399
an A plus in the class.

72
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,639
So, the exam would have nothing to do

73
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,559
with all of the material

74
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,879
we've studied in the class.

75
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,519
All we would have to do is recite a poem.

76
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,559
And so, 24 hours before the class,

77
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,433
he distributes the poem

78
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,098
and it actually turns out

79
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:35,679
not to be a literary poem,

80
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,270
but rather the text transcription

81
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,839
of Apple computer's

82
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,620
"Think Different"

83
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,919
television advertisement

84
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,340
which ran in the late 1980s,

85
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:43,999
and early 1990s.

86
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,879
If you haven't seen the ad,

87
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,239
you can go on YouTube and search

88
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,079
for Apple Computer "Think Different",

89
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,199
and you can see the ad for yourself.

90
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,271
But I was forced to memorize that ad

91
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:53,396
when I was 12 years old

92
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:55,879
and recite it back to him perfectly.

93
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,759
And maybe I'll share with you now,

94
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,113
just for folks who don't know

95
00:02:59,313 --> 00:02:59,719
how it goes.

96
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,738
It's short.

97
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:02,959
The advertisement says,

98
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,586
"Here's to the crazy ones,

99
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:06,045
the misfits, the rebels,

100
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:08,287
the round pegs in the square holes,

101
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:10,599
the ones who see things differently.

102
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,658
They're not fond of rules

103
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,244
and they have no respect

104
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:14,399
for the status quo.

105
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,549
You can quote them,

106
00:03:15,749 --> 00:03:16,759
disagree with them,

107
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,279
glorify or vilify them.

108
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,204
But about the only thing you can't do

109
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,279
is ignore them because they change things

110
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,639
and they push the human race forward.

111
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,497
And while some may see them

112
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:29,679
as the crazy ones, we see genius.

113
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,205
Because the people

114
00:03:30,405 --> 00:03:31,096
who are crazy enough

115
00:03:31,097 --> 00:03:33,907
to think they can change the world

116
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:35,520
are the ones who do."

117
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,639
And so, at a really young age,

118
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,599
I was reciting this message back to him.

119
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,919
Yeah, it was life changing.

120
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,994
And so, I asked our teacher

121
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:46,553
after this whole exercise,

122
00:03:46,753 --> 00:03:47,599
how do you actually

123
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,999
go about changing the world?

124
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,999
Like, tactically speaking,

125
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,119
what are ways to embody that message?

126
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,910
And he told me,

127
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,279
"Ben one of the best ways

128
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,039
to change the world

129
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,759
is to be an entrepreneur,

130
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,119
is to see opportunity

131
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,919
where other people see challenge,

132
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,805
to not just complain about problems

133
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:05,559
in the world,

134
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,839
but try to solve those problems."

135
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,462
And he said,

136
00:04:08,662 --> 00:04:10,683
"The next time you experience

137
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,559
frustration in your life,

138
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,582
ask yourself whether

139
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:15,719
you could solve that frustration for you

140
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,439
and everyone else

141
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,799
who has that frustration and maybe

142
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,959
make some money while doing it."

143
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,839
And up until that point in my life,

144
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,628
I had really not thought of myself

145
00:04:23,828 --> 00:04:24,679
as an entrepreneur.

146
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,239
I didn't know much

147
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,079
about entrepreneurship,

148
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,999
but he really inspired me to think

149
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,359
and apply that lens to the world

150
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,639
to see problem as opportunity.

151
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,934
And so, I started my first company

152
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:37,039
when I was 14 years old,

153
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,840
and I've never looked back.

154
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,206
Seeing every problems an opportunity.

155
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:43,080
I love that.

156
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,640
I've been thinking that,

157
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,270
I recall when I was in the IDF

158
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,439
and I was leading a team there

159
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,310
and we're constantly faced with problems,

160
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,359
and especially

161
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,119
in a very bureaucratic area.

162
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,319
A lot of the times these problems

163
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,999
surrounded the lack of funding

164
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,919
and the lack of our ability

165
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,319
to get new talent coming in.

166
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,359
We had what we had

167
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,786
and a lot of times

168
00:05:03,986 --> 00:05:04,426
they look up to me and say,

169
00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:05,119
"Michael, we have a problem."

170
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,906
And I kept thinking

171
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,319
we have an opportunity for a solution.

172
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,559
And I just love

173
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,079
that embodiment and mindset.

174
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,675
So, walk me through

175
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,365
some of the other experiences

176
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:14,239
that you've had

177
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,396
and how have you used that mindset

178
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:18,279
to get excited about these problems

179
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,839
that you're facing?

180
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,616
Well, the first bias that I had

181
00:05:21,816 --> 00:05:22,778
about the mindset was that

182
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:25,399
it was a Silicon Valley only idea.

183
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,039
I was living and growing up

184
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,946
in San Francisco, actually at that time.

185
00:05:29,146 --> 00:05:30,660
And so as I learned more

186
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,599
about entrepreneurship, I assumed

187
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,879
that what entrepreneurship meant

188
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,039
was starting a technology business

189
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,679
in Silicon Valley

190
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,759
because that's what everyone else

191
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,440
was doing around me.

192
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:41,538
And it wasn't until

193
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:43,308
I really started traveling

194
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:46,138
and I left the US for the first time

195
00:05:46,338 --> 00:05:47,599
and traveled around

196
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,399
meeting with different people

197
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,799
who I'd met online,

198
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,479
who had been following

199
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,799
some of my writing,

200
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,760
that I realized that entrepreneurship

201
00:05:53,761 --> 00:05:55,079
was actually global.

202
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,155
That there are people

203
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,599
all around the world with that mindset.

204
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,514
And there are people creating

205
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,839
all different types of businesses

206
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,279
all around the world.

207
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,440
You didn't need to be in San Francisco.

208
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:04,479
You actually also don't need

209
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,599
to be starting a tech business.

210
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,680
There are lots of different types

211
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,110
of businesses to start

212
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,460
and a lot of problems

213
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,720
to solve in the world.

214
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:12,679
And so, a really formative experience

215
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,439
for me after the Mac,

216
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,999
after my teacher forced me to memorize

217
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,679
the Apple advertisement,

218
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,560
was leaving America for the first time

219
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,160
when I was

220
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,159
maybe 18 years old

221
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,319
and spending four or five months

222
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,599
in Asia, in Europe and Latin America

223
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,280
and some in the Middle East, and just

224
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:32,719
meeting all these different people

225
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,796
who were inspiring me

226
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:35,519
with their own entrepreneurial energy.

227
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,760
And that really taught me about

228
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:39,919
entrepreneurship is a global idea,

229
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,559
and that it's a life idea

230
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,480
more than a business one.

231
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,960
It's a mindset that you apply

232
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,400
to your life and to any industry.

233
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,280
You don't just have to be

234
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
starting an Internet company.

235
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,959
I just love that. Obviously.

236
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,719
Coming from Israel,

237
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,679
my grandparents came

238
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,249
on the boats into a Kibbutz

239
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:56,119
and that whole

240
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,319
entrepreneurial journey there,

241
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,880
they're telling me,

242
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,439
"Michael, you know,

243
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,999
you think you're an entrepreneur,

244
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,159
you go to Silicon Valley

245
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,799
with all your VC friends,

246
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,737
and you form startups?"

247
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:05,506
"No. The real entrepreneurship story

248
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:06,797
is how this world is formed

249
00:07:06,997 --> 00:07:08,739
and how we built railroads

250
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:10,211
and how we invented agriculture

251
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:11,399
in the middle of the desert."

252
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,399
I mean, these are the real.

253
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,271
And so, I couldn't agree more.

254
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:15,399
And talk to me a little bit about

255
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,239
Village Global

256
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,915
because it's a phenomenal,

257
00:07:18,115 --> 00:07:18,879
phenomenal idea.

258
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,097
It's not just another

259
00:07:20,297 --> 00:07:21,127
venture capital fund.

260
00:07:21,327 --> 00:07:23,479
You're building this incredible community

261
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,039
of global thinkers and global leaders.

262
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,119
Probably if I just started

263
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,000
reciting the names,

264
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,407
the jaws are going to drop

265
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:31,799
of people that are involved.

266
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,919
And I have some great friends

267
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,919
that are part of this network.

268
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,714
Tell me a little bit about

269
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:35,622
what you've built

270
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:36,821
and what was the motivation

271
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:37,587
behind building this

272
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:38,914
hundred million dollar

273
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:40,039
venture capital fund?

274
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,799
Yeah, a few years ago,

275
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,880
my partners and I founded Village Global

276
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,818
to be an entirely new

277
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:48,000
sort of venture capital firm.

278
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,760
And we believe that the nature

279
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,800
of entrepreneurship was changing.

280
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,927
And so, we needed to build

281
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:54,356
a venture platform

282
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:56,199
that would change with it,

283
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,799
that would adapt to this new world

284
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,600
of entrepreneurship

285
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,760
in the new world of work.

286
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,800
Some of the ways that entrepreneurship

287
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,920
have changed include this global point

288
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,840
that we've been talking about,

289
00:08:04,841 --> 00:08:06,199
which is there are great talent

290
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,959
all around the world.

291
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,880
It's cheaper and easier

292
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,039
to start a company than ever before.

293
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,199
And increasingly,

294
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,159
software is transforming

295
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,239
all different types of industries.

296
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,876
And so, it's a much more diverse

297
00:08:18,076 --> 00:08:19,704
set of businesses today that VC's

298
00:08:19,904 --> 00:08:21,359
ought to invest in rather than just

299
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,640
traditional software companies.

300
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:26,359
And so, we built Village with the idea

301
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,519
of being a network driven venture firm

302
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,319
that could invest around the world

303
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,053
in all different types of

304
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:34,319
IT-enabled businesses.

305
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,773
One of the things

306
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,452
that makes Village unique is

307
00:08:36,652 --> 00:08:37,719
we believe that today's

308
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,679
young entrepreneurs derive a great deal

309
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,439
of inspiration from their iconic heroes

310
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,519
in the industry,

311
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,559
people like Mark Zuckerberg,

312
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,999
people like Bill Gates,

313
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,719
Jeff Bezos and other folks like that.

314
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,053
And so, we spent a long time

315
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:55,319
raising our fund from those people.

316
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,088
So, those people

317
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,119
are the investors in Village.

318
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,279
And then we take their personal capital

319
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,439
and we in turn invest it in the smartest

320
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,679
entrepreneurs that we can find.

321
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,519
So as to sort of bridge the generations

322
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,599
between today's young entrepreneurs

323
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,159
and the luminaries who back Village.

324
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,359
So, just to iterate

325
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,369
this notion that you're taking people

326
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:17,399
like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos,

327
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,999
Bill Gates and the likes,

328
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,519
literally investing their personal funds

329
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,839
into a venture capital fund

330
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,119
that whose mission it is to invest

331
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,519
globally in IT solutions that are really

332
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,239
breakthrough and the smartest people.

333
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,199
How do you go about

334
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,119
fulfilling that mission?

335
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,679
First of all, it sounds like

336
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,239
it's a lot of responsibility.

337
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,199
It sounds like a very scary

338
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,279
responsibility to take.

339
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,427
But I'm sure that it's

340
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:41,332
incredibly exciting.

341
00:09:41,532 --> 00:09:42,359
But how do you actually go ahead

342
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,047
and deploy that strategy

343
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:46,063
and find those best people

344
00:09:46,263 --> 00:09:47,320
around the world?

345
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,840
We have a unique network model

346
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,920
for discovering the best talent

347
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,640
around the world.

348
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:56,239
So, most venture capital firms

349
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,534
historically have operated

350
00:09:57,734 --> 00:09:59,319
where there is a handful

351
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,639
of general partners

352
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,359
who sit in an office,

353
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,520
usually in Menlo Park, California,

354
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,760
or some other ecosystem, Tel Aviv,

355
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:07,639
different places around the world

356
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,319
where there are a lot of VCs.

357
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,017
But the partners really act

358
00:10:11,217 --> 00:10:13,320
as if they are masters of the universe,

359
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,840
as if they know all the people who matter

360
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,317
and they expect founders

361
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,230
to parade into their office

362
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,879
and pitch their business.

363
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,159
But we have a different approach.

364
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,069
We leverage a network

365
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:28,480
of founders themselves, angel investors,

366
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,520
professors, ecosystem leaders,

367
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,170
and we empower those people

368
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,160
with our capital to go back

369
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:36,719
their smartest friends.

370
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,470
And so it's a bit more

371
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,879
of a decentralized effort

372
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,199
to source and select

373
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,719
the smartest founders we can.

374
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,639
And by using a network,

375
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,709
we're able to find

376
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:48,209
really amazing entrepreneurs

377
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:51,279
in hidden and undiscovered places.

378
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,399
Wow, what do you get most excited about?

379
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,071
Because you're coming from

380
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:57,319
the very entrepreneurial background,

381
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,759
you've built several companies,

382
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,199
companies that have made

383
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,239
a huge impact back then.

384
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,679
And I believe that some of the companies

385
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,679
that you've built, their technology still

386
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,371
being deployed today, one of which

387
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,759
is used by hundreds of local governments.

388
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,261
So, you've made a huge impact

389
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:12,311
as an entrepreneur yourself,

390
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,806
and now you are making huge impact

391
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,399
as a venture capital investor.

392
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,759
What really makes you excited

393
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,360
about what you're doing?

394
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,319
I think the thing that's really exciting

395
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,439
about our work is being the first

396
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,199
to believe in a founder.

397
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,359
So, we are often at Village,

398
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,270
we're often investing

399
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,347
in pre-seed and seed stage rounds

400
00:11:30,547 --> 00:11:31,965
or a formation stage rounds

401
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:33,552
where we're the first person

402
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:35,544
to commit to the first firm,

403
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:37,079
to commit to a founder.

404
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,541
And so, we really feel like

405
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:39,836
we are increasing

406
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:42,199
the total entrepreneurship in the world.

407
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,234
There's a lot of capital

408
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:44,308
that will pile in

409
00:11:44,508 --> 00:11:45,799
to late stage venture rounds

410
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,027
where they're already,

411
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:48,052
Stride, for example,

412
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:49,440
apparently is raising a new round

413
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,233
of financing

414
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:52,159
at a hundred billion dollar valuation.

415
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,719
That's awesome.

416
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,279
Stride had a huge impact.

417
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,839
But it's more fulfilling for me to think

418
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,359
that we could be the first to invest

419
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,175
in Stride at the

420
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,602
two million dollar valuation

421
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:01,609
rather than the

422
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:03,439
hundred billion dollar valuation,

423
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,893
because that's what it means

424
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:05,879
to bet on the underdogs.

425
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,279
That's what it means to take a risk.

426
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,119
That's what it means

427
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,879
to believe when others do not.

428
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,562
And I think there's something

429
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,519
very satisfying about having that

430
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:16,368
sort of contrarian view and then

431
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,159
seeing all these other investors

432
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,959
follow us at later stages.

433
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,559
100%.

434
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,079
I took a fascinating class

435
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,999
with Ann from Floodgate at Stanford,

436
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,879
a venture capital class.

437
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,399
And one of the things

438
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,079
that we talked about

439
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,279
was the different investment stages.

440
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,239
I have the privilege of doing

441
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,559
the due diligence in the fund called

442
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,040
the J-Ventures in very early stage.

443
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,328
And one of the key differences

444
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:36,843
that I was always taught was that

445
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:38,119
if you're investing early stage,

446
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:38,959
your due diligence

447
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,999
is really about the people.

448
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,840
It's about their backgrounds,

449
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,537
about their personality

450
00:12:42,737 --> 00:12:43,644
and their perseverance.

451
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:45,512
Their due diligence on later stages

452
00:12:45,712 --> 00:12:46,560
is a lot also

453
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,560
about the spreadsheets,

454
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:48,439
about the finances,

455
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,253
about you believing in the business model

456
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:50,959
moving forward.

457
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,719
So, I can definitely see the excitement

458
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,599
that you bring towards this.

459
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,879
Ben, take me back a little bit

460
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,760
to your entrepreneurial journey.

461
00:12:58,761 --> 00:12:59,479
Obviously you're doing

462
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,279
incredible stuff now

463
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,079
with Village Global,

464
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,879
but that's just the sliver

465
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,319
about your humungous experience.

466
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,605
Talk to me about the different ventures

467
00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:08,941
that you've formed and the two books

468
00:13:09,141 --> 00:13:11,999
that you've written with Reid Hoffman.

469
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,239
Sure.

470
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,840
Well, I was rolling back the clock

471
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,520
to that class that I took where I

472
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,997
memorized the Apple advertisement

473
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,468
and then the global trip I took

474
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:20,837
that opened my eyes

475
00:13:21,037 --> 00:13:22,559
to global entrepreneurship.

476
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,359
I spent several years

477
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,701
founding and running

478
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:28,153
an enterprise software company

479
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:29,879
that sold CRM software

480
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,079
to local governments.

481
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,920
And I really enjoyed that experience.

482
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:34,479
And that business

483
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,759
continues today to serve

484
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,599
a whole bunch of customers in the US.

485
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,437
I took a few years break

486
00:13:42,637 --> 00:13:44,166
from entrepreneurship

487
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,680
and focused on writing,

488
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,239
and those are the books you mentioned.

489
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,439
So, I co-authored a book called,

490
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,239
The Start‑up of You,

491
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,717
which is a career strategy guide

492
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,159
on how to apply entrepreneurial

493
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,959
insights to your own life.

494
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,200
And then I co-authored a book called

495
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,004
The Alliance,

496
00:13:56,204 --> 00:13:57,719
which is about how companies

497
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,119
can attract entrepreneurial talent

498
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,159
into their organizations.

499
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,319
Both are bestsellers,

500
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,759
but that's irrelevant, of course.

501
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,212
Well, that we were really lucky

502
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,846
that both books found

503
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:09,279
an engaged audience.

504
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,039
And both topics are really interesting,

505
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,942
I think.

506
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,866
And I learned a lot.

507
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:16,046
Writing forces you to

508
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:18,119
clarify your thinking.

509
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,439
And so to really flash out my views

510
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,839
and to get to know my co-author,

511
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,119
Reid Hoffman, which started LinkedIn

512
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,679
in both of those books,

513
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,559
that was a really tremendous privilege.

514
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,159
And so, I've been going back and forth

515
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,359
in my life between writing

516
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,639
and entrepreneurship.

517
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,588
These days, I'm 100% focused

518
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:36,839
on Village Global

519
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,079
and entrepreneurship and venture capital.

520
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,039
But I suspect in the future I'll go back

521
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,479
to writing books at some point

522
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,439
and hopefully go back and forth because

523
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,301
you can have a different

524
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,795
sort of impact writing books.

525
00:14:46,995 --> 00:14:48,439
For me, my drug of choice is impact,

526
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,560
so entrepreneurship's certainly one way.

527
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:51,600
But you can also influence

528
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,671
the way people think,

529
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:55,720
and books and articles

530
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:58,399
are a way of doing that for me.

531
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:58,999
Right.

532
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,279
All this back and forth,

533
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,997
going from being an entrepreneur

534
00:15:02,197 --> 00:15:03,430
to being a writer,

535
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,279
spending time at the LinkedIn

536
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,599
and Greylock offices, venture capital,

537
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,159
suspecting to link back,

538
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,759
talk to me about this whole mindset

539
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,319
of moving around and experiencing

540
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,895
and really mastering and harnessing

541
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:16,617
this different skill sets

542
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,040
as a lifelong entrepreneur.

543
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,200
I think some of us live lives that are

544
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,440
unplanned and serendipitous

545
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,600
and involve lots of zigging and zagging.

546
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,440
And that's certainly been my life.

547
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,840
I've never had a grand master plan.

548
00:15:33,841 --> 00:15:36,319
Every year brings its own share

549
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,919
of surprises and opportunities.

550
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,039
Of course, the year 2020

551
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,919
is a great example of this.

552
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,639
Whatever plan people may have laid

553
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,840
in January has almost certainly

554
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,920
been disrupted by the pandemic.

555
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:47,966
And so, I'm a huge believer

556
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,508
in staying adaptive,

557
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,319
staying flexible and being

558
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,239
opportunistic as things arise.

559
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,040
And for me,

560
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,160
sort of my blessing and my curse is

561
00:15:57,161 --> 00:15:59,359
that I have a lot of different interests.

562
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,845
And so, there are a lot of things

563
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:02,799
I want to do in this world that are

564
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,840
somewhat unrelated to each other.

565
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,800
And so, for me,

566
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,200
venture capital is an interesting path

567
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,040
because it does actually

568
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,359
involve a lot of diversity.

569
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,199
There are a lot of different

570
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,119
types of businesses.

571
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,997
We invest in a lot of different

572
00:16:16,197 --> 00:16:17,835
sorts of challenges,

573
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:19,720
and that's satisfying.

574
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,760
By contrast, you know,

575
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:23,359
when you start a company requires

576
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,400
a lot of focus on just that company

577
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
for a very long period of time.

578
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,920
And there are advantages to that.

579
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,958
I actually think you can have

580
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:30,999
the most impact in the world

581
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,493
by starting the business

582
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:33,840
much more than a VC can.

583
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:34,839
But the tradeoff is

584
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,479
you're really thinking

585
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,599
about that one industry,

586
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,399
that one product area for potentially

587
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,359
10 to 12, 15, 20 years of your life.

588
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,039
And so for me, my own

589
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,239
zigging and zagging in life

590
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,879
has been an attempt to satisfy

591
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,919
a diverse set of interests.

592
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,160
Going back all the way to being

593
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,519
12 years old and reciting

594
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,560
the great poem, but then,

595
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,520
you know, a lot of the people that are

596
00:16:58,521 --> 00:16:59,552
hopefully watching this

597
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:00,719
are young entrepreneurs,

598
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,786
whether they're from Stanford

599
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:03,766
and any other college in the US,

600
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:04,599
from Tel Aviv.

601
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,959
And it's scary.

602
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,759
You know, it feels like a constant race.

603
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,199
There's a lot of pressure

604
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,719
going on that you have to raise

605
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,040
the most amount of money,

606
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,040
and you have to hire quickly

607
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,919
and you have to scale really quickly.

608
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,599
And what I'd love to spend

609
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,239
the last few minutes

610
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,116
is talk to me a little bit about

611
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:25,239
your perspective on this fresh, young,

612
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,249
entrepreneurial experience,

613
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:29,279
and what myself and my friends

614
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:30,674
can take away moving forward

615
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:33,003
as we begin our entrepreneurial journey

616
00:17:33,203 --> 00:17:34,639
at the end, to make an impact?

617
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,417
What are some key things

618
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:37,097
that we should be keeping in mind

619
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:38,558
and some key pieces of advice

620
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,400
that you've accumulated over the years?

621
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,719
Well, I think the sense of pressure

622
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,149
on oneself has pros and cons, I mean,

623
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:48,083
the truth is

624
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:50,039
it is a very competitive world.

625
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,804
If you want to be successful

626
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,498
in anything that you do,

627
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,239
it would seem to be obvious

628
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,399
when you look at other successful people

629
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,516
that hard work is required

630
00:17:57,716 --> 00:17:58,509
and that a lot of people

631
00:17:58,709 --> 00:17:59,799
try to be successful but can't.

632
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,288
And so, and especially in fields

633
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:02,824
like entrepreneurship

634
00:18:03,024 --> 00:18:04,159
and venture capital,

635
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,046
it requires a ton of work

636
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:06,208
and a lot of luck, I think,

637
00:18:06,408 --> 00:18:07,639
to achieve any modicum of success.

638
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,910
So, it's rational to feel some stress

639
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,120
about that.

640
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:13,639
At the same time, of course,

641
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,600
you don't want to let the stress

642
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,960
and anxiety and the fear be debilitating.

643
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,342
And it's useful, I think, to cultivate

644
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,536
a spiritual practice

645
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,163
or to codify a set of personal values

646
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,759
or to remember the bigger picture

647
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,920
about what matters in life

648
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,199
with regards to relationships and family

649
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,759
and things like that,

650
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,559
so as to not be totally overtaken

651
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,039
by the stress involved with

652
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,840
one's career ambitions.

653
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,920
I'd say with respect

654
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,070
to the sort of things to keep in mind,

655
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,655
I think the best decisions

656
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:48,719
that I've ever made

657
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,599
and the worst decisions

658
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,455
I've ever made

659
00:18:50,655 --> 00:18:52,759
have had to do with people

660
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,039
and judgement of people.

661
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,799
And so, probably

662
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,835
the single best meta-skill to develop,

663
00:18:58,035 --> 00:18:59,379
or one of the best meta-skills,

664
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:01,232
because I could think of some others

665
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:01,919
as I say this,

666
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,327
such as how to learn.

667
00:19:03,527 --> 00:19:05,336
But a meta-skill for this conversation

668
00:19:05,536 --> 00:19:06,899
that comes to mind Michael,

669
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,639
is being really good at evaluating people

670
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,669
and understanding whether

671
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:12,279
you want someone in your tribe,

672
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,239
whether you want someone

673
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,079
working at your company,

674
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,759
whether it's somebody

675
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,239
you want to work for.

676
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,762
And just calibrating your sense of,

677
00:19:18,962 --> 00:19:20,759
how do people present themselves,

678
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,199
what are the sorts

679
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,879
of things I'm looking for,

680
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,959
when is someone trying to deceive me,

681
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,799
when is someone deceiving themselves.

682
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,039
And then they lack self-awareness about

683
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,479
their strengths and weaknesses, etc.

684
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,599
People are enormously complicated.

685
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,159
They're also fascinating.

686
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,575
To get really good at

687
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:38,319
understanding the psychology of people,

688
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,719
is a generalizable skill that I think

689
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,079
will be helpful in any number

690
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,040
of career paths.

691
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,879
100%.

692
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,279
One of the things that I have got

693
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,829
and expose myself over the past

694
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:49,679
year and a half or so

695
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,361
has been

696
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:53,374
how many opportunities there are.

697
00:19:53,574 --> 00:19:55,079
And people that are

698
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,599
curious about especially engineering.

699
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,439
And you're investing primarily

700
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,279
in software and in IT solutions.

701
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,799
And the number of opportunities

702
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,599
are just endless.

703
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,535
And the ways in which

704
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:07,208
we can really improve the world

705
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:08,159
is just phenomenal.

706
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,279
And for me as a young entrepreneur,

707
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,439
what I get most excited about

708
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:12,439
is just thinking of all the different

709
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,079
things we can do that can make

710
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,239
a huge, huge impact,

711
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,639
which is why I just love the way

712
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,919
that you're talking about the zigzagging,

713
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,479
This lifelong entrepreneurial journey,

714
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,429
it's not just about

715
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:22,399
what you're working on now.

716
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,888
It's about how you're approaching

717
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:25,639
every problem with the potential solution

718
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,599
and motivating others along the way.

719
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,239
Because I'm sure that just by having

720
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,239
that mindset in yourself,

721
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,499
every person that comes

722
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:33,326
that interacts with Ben

723
00:20:33,526 --> 00:20:34,839
gets that motivation as well.

724
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,958
So, thank you for being inspiration

725
00:20:37,158 --> 00:20:38,623
for me and for whoever else

726
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:39,599
who is watching this.

727
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,115
Before we go, I really want to thank you

728
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:42,439
for being generous with your time.

729
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,599
And the hardest question, three words

730
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,160
that you would use to describe yourself.

731
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,679
Three words that come to mind,

732
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,039
the first obvious, entrepreneurial,

733
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,039
the second curious.

734
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
I have a lot of different interests.

735
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,960
I'm curious about things.

736
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:58,279
And the third would be reflective.

737
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,719
I tend to reflect a lot on my life

738
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,503
and the world around me,

739
00:21:02,703 --> 00:21:04,519
and for better or for worse,

740
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,479
reflective would be my third choice.

741
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,799
It's very counterintuitive

742
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,066
to see someone who is so driven,

743
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:09,799
who has done so much,

744
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,839
and then say that they're,

745
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,399
one of the words

746
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,752
that a best describes them is reflective,

747
00:21:13,952 --> 00:21:15,159
which often has a connotation

748
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,759
of sitting back, taking a moment,

749
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,375
breathing and thinking through

750
00:21:18,575 --> 00:21:19,559
what they're feeling.

751
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,319
So, I highly appreciate that.

752
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,999
Ben, thank you very much.

753
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,319
Stay safe and stay healthy

754
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,279
during these crazy times.

755
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,519
And I hope to meet in person

756
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,279
back in the Silicon Valley.

757
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:30,879
Thank you, Michael.
