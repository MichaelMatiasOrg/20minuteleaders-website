1 You have to really try and see where you can identify need. This is marketing was all about. It's about identifying the needs and finding the right product to match those needs. Shirley Segal, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Good morning. Thank you. Good morning. And thank you for having me. It's a pleasure to have you. We're calling from a sunny morning here in Tel Aviv, but actually, it's not your preferred weather. You mentioned to me that your preferred weather for some really weird reason is foggy rain? I don't know. I'm a broken Israeli I think. Probably my soul was born somewhere in the prairies of Poland. I like the drizzling. I like it where it's nice and gloomy. That's where I'm happiest. But I'm born here. So, I go along with the flow. What can I do. So, you're going to have to go along with the beautiful weather and the beautiful sun that goes on the beach. But it's okay. Because today, we're talking about your journey. We're talking about being a marketing director at various companies. Very, very well known in Israel. All the way from Bezeq to Cellcom to Zap, companies that really marketing is part of their core, ideation and innovation. We know how difficult the market is in Israel, so, I'm excited to talk about that. But I'm also excited to talk about your experience with the 8200 International Alumni Community and how that relates back to serving in the 8200 units. So, Shirley, take me back. How do you start your journey out of 8200? What is sort of like your thinking process as you go along? Oh, I was in a very traditional thinking process. Okay, I need to go to the university, Tel Aviv University, the best university, the best place, because I'm  8200 and that's where we went. And I think the click happened during Marketing 101. And the MBA of business administration in the Tel Aviv University, it was like falling in love. Suddenly the way I understood about how to influence, how to understand and influence people's behavior, that was where I found myself in my natural element. I remember distinctly I said, "Oh, this is what I want to do." And from that point on, my aim was to go to the best places in Israel and later on international. To the best places where the marketing challenges, the one that will actually blow my mind. So, started up for one of the Bezeq companies. But actually Cellcom, I think was probably the one that really formed my marketing personality. Because Cellcom, at the time was a company for the big numbers. And this is marketing for me. This is the real challenge in marketing. It's taking a whole world of numbers and trying to find  the story behind them. And not only try and find the story behind them, make your story so that it works. So, this is like sound like Lit 101. No, but it's marketing 101. So, whether it starts with huge excels files, Arpo and Age, you have to really try and see where, where you can identify needs. This is marketing was all about. It's about identifying the needs and finding the right product to match those needs. And funnily enough, those needs will appear on Excel sheets. They will also appear on focus groups. And something that little people know but it will also appear when you talk to colleagues. And we had some of the greatest success stories, coming out not from focus groups and not from talking to customers, and that's from looking at the Excel sheet. But it was this, how about if we did this first plan and know it will work. We ran that with surveys. We ran that with focus group. Everybody says it won't work and it works like a charm. Because sometimes, it's about good intuition and believing in something that's logical and going with it all the way. Sometimes your customers are not believing. They go for the pay as you go and you say: okay, let's try packages, or say: no, we don't work packages. But when the packages come and are offered to them, they go for packages. So, you just have to try. A lot of the time you just have to try and know that you're going to fail, sometimes miserably, but you just have to try and give it a good try every once in a while. Go against everything. Everybody says and try a new concept. Because this not only benefits the organization, it also benefits yourself. You know that sometimes you have to try something new. You go against the flow. Fail and sometimes you get great success and you understand that it's not always about harvesting it from the Excels and from the customers, it's also about finding the ideas that will generate later on good growth options. 100%. Yeah. And I have to ask because in Cellcom, one of the incredible positions that you've held, which is fascinating to me, is customer retention, right? And I know from living in Israel how competitive this industry is. So, can you tell me a little bit about Cellcom and what was really your position going into this role, which is incredibly, incredibly difficult, incredibly competitive? So, tell me a little bit about what it was like. So, it was not only the greatest the better part I think, of working the marketing, of being in charge of retention. But the timing was an unbelievably amazing timing because at the time, the minister of communication cancelled the living fees. So, actually there were no barriers into moving from one company to the other. And if this has happened, I think in about two or three months, we knew it was coming. We didn't believe it was coming. We prepared ourselves. But once it came, it started an unbelievably fierce war price between the companies because suddenly, there were no barriers to leaving any companies. You had the number, there were no fines, hallelujah. And in I think in two months, the prices dropped in 200, 300% And the term was unbelievable. And add new MVNOs, going into the game and they had nothing to lose. Again, for all they know, they can name a price tag of 19 shekels, which is like, I don't know, six, eight dollars and they'll gain. And also the regulatory procedures allow them, really encourage them to add as many subscribers as they can until such a time where if they have this amount, they'll be able to go further. So, everything was laid out to good, healthy, unbelievable price war. And this happened overnight. And what you do is you form what you say, you form a war room which convenes every day at 12. You have to look at the numbers. You have to identify where you get the most journaled out and what are you going to do in return. And Cellcom is a big company. At the time it was 5,000, seven. A very large company. And, you know, the large companies are not in the habit of working very fast. But this was, I think, a defining moment for Cellcom, because you actually saw how a very large company working very slowly and very methodically can convene at 12 PM and decide that this is a price plan that will give the best solution. And by five o'clock, You have the price plan in place after going all through so many people and development and you have the price plan in place and you're ready for 8 AM next day to launch it. This is how things should happen everywhere. And this is where I go. And this is where, personally, I get the kick out of. You know, I said that in Cellcom, the best thing that you came around 8 AM, you said, okay, I need to do this, that this is how I do it. But by 11, and always, 11 AM was a magic moment. Something happened. Something happened that you went, Oh, no. What am I doing next? And you had to really make a handstand and forget everything you wanted to do by that point and try and do something else just to match reality. Unbelievable. So, this was that period. And it was an awesome period, really. So much adrenaline. So much excitement. Really working around the clock. But really, this is a magic moment for any company and for every professional where you actually feel that you have no limits. And things you thought that cannot be done can be done. Everything can be done. If can just put your mind to it. 100%. Yeah. And from that point on, the loyalty policy actually changed 180 degrees. Because up to that point, we've had big loyalty programs and large campaigns and great benefits. And it was all about surprise and delight. You know, now you have this amazing benefit and you can take out all your friends out for breakfast on our expense, or you can buy books for very low prices. That was the policy up to that point. And the policy from that point onward, because it was obvious that people no longer found it interesting, they said, okay, just give me the best price. And let me be. Don't call me. Don't give me benefits. I'm not interested. Just give me the best price. Because that was what energized the market at that point. Right. And from that point on, it was a lot about the service, the ongoing service and the ongoing relationship between the subscriber, the customer and ourselves. It was about bringing values of being very honest, very outgoing. The saying Hebrew shakuf, transparency. And that was a value that became very important during that time. I'm Sure. No more you know, complicated price plans, no more services, add-on services. Being very transparent to our subscribers, create one magic word, which is trust. 100%. And that's where you get loyalty. I think that just phenomenal. Yeah. And that's a challenge. I have to ask you because I'm fascinated also by your work with Zap. I love Zap. It's a group that has three subgroups that you were in charge of also their marketing. Rest.co.il, Mishlohim and Mitchatnim. And so tell me what lessons did you bring with you from Cellcom and Bezeq as you're transitioning to be director of marketing for these very different companies? Right? They're not the same. It's not the same customer experience. It's not always the same customers. So, what lessons did you bring in and what new challenges did you have to face? Yes. So, that was actually the Israeli yelp. The challenge there, it's always about the marketing challenge. And the marketing challenge there was actually going both ways. It's a B2B challenge because you work, the advertisers are small, medium businesses in Israel, which I knew very well from my time working in Cellcom and Bezeq. But also, it's the Israeli crowd. You have to please the people that will eventually coming to rest, coming to deliveries, coming to the wedding website. So, it's a double side challenge. And this is the part where I can talk for hours and hours. But it's also about finding how everything into meet, finding how I give the, the people who come to the website a definite value. And we did that actually in Rest first and then onwards for Mishlohim by personalization. And you think personalization it's so obvious, but to check a website, that was just a restaurant website with ratings and nice pictures and making it into a website that actually, when you come in, Michael, and when I come in, we see two different websites. You get the recommendations for you, you get the content that will match your needs. And I get that different content, different recommendations. And by adding personalization into these websites, we actually prove the win-win situation. More surface came in, a lot more surface came in, the website SEO went up the roof and our advertisers were happy. Because not only we brought more traffic, we brought more relevant traffic for them. And when you ask what connects Zap group, and you know, the Israeli Yelp and Cellcom, it's about identifying the needs. It's always about that. Identifying the needs and talking to the customers and really understanding what makes everybody ticks and going on from there, developing the product that would best suit everybody's needs. And also for me, it's technology. So, I'm a big fan of everything that's techie. And really, when you see the last 20 years and what technology brought in for marketing, this is a small time revolution. Because we went on from starting out from just having surveys and measuring traffic into really having concise insights into the buyer persona and having immediate, which is awesome immediate feedback about how campaigns are going. And not going into one big campaign, but going into 20, 30, sometimes 100 micro campaigns and just optimizing as we go and seeing what works best for us. So, this is also one thing in common. It's technology and how you can use it to be a better marketer and to develop better products and making your customers happy, which is the basic for every loyal customer. Right. I think what I'm taking away from this is primarily, really the art behind marketing and really the perspective of really understanding what makes people tick and really what they're looking for and forming this relationship, not just with your customers, but forming this relationship with what you're marketing, and the product that you're using, that you're using to market because that relationship it sounds that you have to really be transparent and honest with it in order for it to come out authentic and to really gain the loyalty and trust of the customers. Shirley, 20 minutes go by so fast. And I want to thank you for being so generous with your time. It's unbelievable. But we do have the most important question. We have the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. Okay. So, disclaimer, I did think about it ahead of time. Curious. First thing is curious, I'm impossible on the bordering of really going into every detail, people. That's the most interesting thing. You should know, you know, how many interviews have you had so far, over 200. That's the most interesting thing, talking to people and learning things that are on YouTube. So curious, energetic. I think it came across, you know. Bring it all. I love being in good dynamic places. And the last thing that I'm very hands on, you know, I really like to get my hands dirty. I will always be the one who goes, oh, let me handle that. Because you do learn things by your own experience. Don't go too far away from where everything happens. Get your hands dirty. Because that's where you really learn. I love it. Shirley, thank you very much. Toda raba. Best of luck with your continuing great work with marketing direction. And thank you for the inspiration over these past 20 minutes. Thank you very much. Have a good one. Bye bye.
