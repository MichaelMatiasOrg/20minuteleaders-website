1 So, don't be deterred by a no in any way. Frankly, I got so many no's in 2017. But, and obviously there were self-doubt moments as well. I was like, oh my God, am I doing this the right way? I don't know what's going on. Spandana Palaypu, thank you so much for joining me all the way from the United Arab Emirates. How are you? Good. Good. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Thank you very much for being here. I just came back from a wonderful trip to Dubai. It was remarkable, eye-opening and getting to know a whole new, very similar, yet very different culture. I'm calling from Tel Aviv. And I think that although the locals in Dubai and Israelis are very similar in a lot of ways, there's a lot of cultural differences in how business is done, how relationships are formed. So, I think it was very fascinating. I'm glad to hear that. I mean, considering everything's opened up now, I'm just glad to see that, you know, things are progressing in the right direction. 100%. And while we're waiting for you here in Tel Aviv, but in the meantime, I'll have to gauge your brain here in these next 20 minutes. Spandana, you've had a remarkable journey leading up to ZoEasy. And I'd love to focus on that as well. But first, I have to go back and understand a little bit about your passions and the different things that you've done from the different speaking engagements and being ambassadors of different organizations. I actually also participated in the EPGY program at Stanford, just like you did. But tell me a little bit about what's been happening with you up until now. So, honestly, like just a regular 25 year old if you ask me. The whole drive around education and employment, that was always instilled in me as a child. To be honest, I've always been the kind of person that was into community service and doing things in relation to education. I used to teach in high school and I used to teach kids from underprivileged backgrounds and I used to teach children with learning disabilities as well. So, education and employment have always been very close to my heart. And I also come from a very strong entrepreneurial family. So, like my dad's an entrepreneur, my uncle's an entrepreneur. So, you know, that I think also kind of instilled a little bit of that business part within me when I was younger. And I knew that I wanted to do something that was in relation to education, employment or health care. But I didn't really know what was the right path to kind of pursue for that. Do I go into medicine, because medicine was something that I had considered at one point. Or do I go into business. And being from a traditional South Indian family, you know, business is usually like a wary subjected to you. Either go into engineering or you go into medicine. Those are your two key career choices. But I remember sitting my parents down and like taking them through this entire decision matrix of who I thought like business was the right options. And post university, honestly, it reached a point where I wanted to actually go into consulting before starting my own social enterprise, because ultimately that was the end goal. But as I was applying for jobs and I even got an offer from a big four. At the same time, I was also working on ZoEasy as an idea because, I mean, growing up in the UAE you do get to interact with people from diverse backgrounds, different walks of life. And a big part of that is the blue collar community. And so, hearing their stories is truly it's a remarkable experience because you meet engineers who are working as cleaners. You'll meet waiters who actually have teaching backgrounds. So, you know, these are people that are actually skilled but end up in different circumstances, mainly because of middlemen and brokers in their home countries who sell them a dream, which is very different to reality. And in the process, they even pay almost $3,000 to find employment abroad, you know. So, that was when that spark kind of instilled within me, and I knew that this was like, this was my purpose and my passion. And so, when somebody had come forward and shown an interest in investing in ZoEasy and so that was when I decided, okay, let's give this path a try and see how that goes. Let's talk a little bit more about this, about, you know, the circumstances when you see blue color, what do you mean by that? So, anybody that, so, in the UAE, a blue collar worker is essentially defined as somebody that earns about 5,000 dirhams or less. And you have a variation of these professions. So, it ranges from unskilled to skilled to semi-skilled. And what I mean by unskilled is so, for example, if you ask somebody to pick up a box and put it somewhere like, something like that, that would be considered an unskilled person. But you can also go up to a skill level where, you know, sometimes some nurses and some nurses are also considered as a part of the blue/gray collar industry. So, it's a very wide variation. So, it ranges from waiters to the construction industry, hospitality facilities management, a lot of people that work in these industries fall into the blue collar community. And there are almost four million blue collar workers in the UAE. So, that's 43% of the population. It's a massive, yes, it's a massive number. It's a huge part of the community. So, you get to interact with them on a regular basis. And that's how I grew up. You know, like I was always exposed to different nationalities, different communities, different backgrounds. And so, that's where you hear about these stories. So, tell me a little bit about ZoEasy. What were some of the insights that you've gained on how to potentially tackle these circumstances that obviously are not ideal? Of course. So, like I mentioned of as I was doing my research and speaking to more people, you know, I realized that it's not actually a problem that starts in the UAE. It's a problem that starts at the very source, from the country that these job seekers are coming from. They're coming to the UAE to find better employment opportunities. And honestly, I have come across many people who, yes, have come here under a certain pretext. But after joining the firm and understanding that there are ethical employers out here, they have been able to save up and create a better standard of living for their families back home at the end of it. But what we aim to do and what we want to bring as a change to the whole system is essentially removing this network of middlemen. Because both employers and job seekers have to go through about six layers of middlemen before an employee is actually hired. So, employers aren't exactly benefiting because there is no other alternatives in the market, you know. You have a lot of white-collar talent platforms out there, but you don't have anything that is catering to the blue collar community. And so, in the process, you have to rely on this paper based archaic system. And a lot of employers do pay for, they pay these middlemen recruitment fees, but they end up with job seekers that aren't exactly the right fit for what they're looking for. Similarly, job seekers don't exactly have the right guidance or skills to be able to find employment opportunities that are in line with their career aspirations. And so, in the process, this is the only method that's out there. This has been happening for the last 40 to 50 years. There's no other alternatives in the industry. And so you rely on a middleman who sells you this wonderful dream. Oh, you're going to be right next to the Burj Khalifa. It's going to be a great, great job, great experience for you. And that message that the employer puts forward gets completely diluted by the time it reaches the job seeker. So, in the process, employers aren't happy, jobseekers aren't happy. Both have shed money because it goes to the middlemen. So, it's not a win win for either party, to be honest. And that's what we're trying to tackle. Ensure that good employers get access to good people and good people get access to the right employment opportunities so that they can create a better standard of living for their families back home. And you mentioned that a part of it, part of the dissonance that we have here is that, people that have certain skill sets, they don't actually come to fruition in locally in the UAE, where you're specifically looking at. How is ZoEasy actually compromising on that? Right. So, we actually, so one, we did a pilot placement, actually. We wanted to understand how the system worked and what the issues were around this whole sector. And you don't really have a lot of data out there in relation to this industry unless you go and you tackle this first hand yourself. So, we did a pilot placement of 150 people. We also generated a massive database, but from within that database, we chose one 150 people, 150 job seekers that we could place within different industries. So, we looked at industries like construction, hospitality and so on. And we understood what the hindrances were offline and what were the processes that we could move online to make the system more ethical and more transparent. And that could also help jobseekers showcase their skills in better ways. So, that's where we came up with the concept of implementing things like video CVs and live interviewing. Because many of these job seekers don't know how to write good CVs, but they know how to express themselves really well. So, that's where these tools will come in to provide a more holistic perspective of the job seeker. And that also reduces a lot of like the travel costs that are involved for employers who would otherwise have to travel to India or travel to parts of Southeast Asia in order to be able to recruit people from the ground. You know what I mean? Right. So, just for context, out of the 40% blue collar workers in the UAE, what is the estimated percentage of them that could be transformed into skilled workers but they're just out of circumstance, positioned as blue collar workers in unskilled positions? Honestly, a big chunk. I would say easily about 28 to 30% can be converted. It's a big chunk. There are people, there are first timers that come out here and then move up the ladder. There are people like that. But a big majority that you meet are actually skilled people who have ended up in the wrong employment opportunities because of some middlemen in their home country. So, it's about the way you showcase your skills and how you can put that forward. And what we do is we explicitly work with ethical employers. So, we look for employers who have strong HR, CSR policies in place. We work with employers who have a focus on diversity and inclusion because, you know, industries like manufacturing, for example, they don't employ a lot of women, even though a lot of women can actually be skilled for that job. And in fact, we tied up with one such employer recently, like Deltron Paints is very focused on diversity and inclusion, and they want to include more women in the workforce. So, finding employers like that to work with is also very important because they create a great environment for the candidate to thrive in. And so, we identify employers like that to work with. But simultaneously, you also need to look at the job seeker themselves. And it's not just about the skill that they have, but their personality also plays a big role in who they are. I mean, we placed somebody that was actually from the logistics industry. And he was earning about 1500 dirhams a month. Right? Wow. And yeah, he was earning 1500 dirhams a month to start with. And something happened at his workplace. One of his coworkers had said, it was, there was a racial comment made towards him. So, he decided to leave. And he had a 30 day grace period within which he had to find another employment opportunity. And so, that's when we got connected. And when we met him, honestly, he is one of the most wonderful people you will meet. He's so great to talk to and he has so much wisdom to give. I mean, there were things that I learned as a person from him. Some of his quotes were unbelievable. And that's when I realized that this guy could actually be a great fit in the hospitality industry and he'd be able to earn even more than what he was earning in the logistics space. And so, we placed him with the hospitality employer. And he I mean, there was he almost had like a 50% boost in his salary because you're not only getting a base, but you're also getting tips from customers and you know how to interact with people. That's your strength so, why not use it. Well, I think that's just remarkable. So, if you look at the vision a few years forward, what's going to happen with ZoEasy as far as you're seeing it? Honestly, for me, like five years down the line, I want to make sure that we help educate and find ethical employment opportunities for one million job seekers, at least. And honestly, the aim is to become the go to platform for the migrant workforce. We want to be that platform that the migrant workforce can turn to, especially in relation to these specific fields. And essentially, what that contributes towards more than anything is helping people find like attain economic empowerment. Right? When you attain economic empowerment, you're reducing inequalities in the community. You're creating greater diversity in the community, and you're also having a ripple effect. So, it's not just that one person that you're impacting, but you are actually impacting five other people in their families and creating a better standard of living for them and a better standard of living for generations to come. So, it's not just that one person you're impacting, but it has a ripple effect across multiple generations. I think that's wonderful. And I want to spend more time talking about ZoEasy, but I also really want to gauge your brain on the different activities that you've done. For example, the World Economic Forum and the work that you're doing there. Tell me, how did you get involved with that and what is the work that you're doing? Honestly, it all comes down to networking. So, I've come to realize that's a good trait to have. If you know how to reach out to the right people and just basically know how to get people engaged with you and invest in you as a person and also invest in your ideas. Right? So, I actually came across the Global Shapers community at One Young World, which is another youth, large youth network and organization. So, I was a delegate speaker at One Young World 2018 in The Hague. And somebody from the Global Shapers community had seen me speak. And so, we connected afterwards and she told me about this wonderful community. And what I really like about the Global Shapers community, honestly, is the fact that you have people, you have young leaders, but who come from so many different backgrounds and who have so many different skill sets. But you're all working towards the same vision. You all want to create some form of social impact in the community. And the WEFs key pillars are focused on education and employment, equity and inclusion and the environment. So, these are the three main areas that they look at, and these are all three passion areas for me. So, I joined the Global Shapers community in early 2019, and I was actually a part of helping one of their, now biggest projects. So, Global Shapers Dubai's current biggest project is with a foundation called the Al Ghurair's Foundation for Education, and they provide scholarships to underprivileged youth for universities. And the person that was leading this initiative at the beginning, I had helped him assist with putting out the first workshop and taking them through project management courses, how to raise funding, how to basically put your idea out there and make sure that it grows. Because practically, experience, at the end of the day is very different to what you learn at university or in a classroom. Right? So, that was one of the first education initiatives that we've launched. Now I'm the vice curator of the hub, so, I'm also part of the leadership team and helping manage it, but also ensuring that more projects are coming out in relation to the other pillars as well. And we actually did a really cool initiative recently, like we launched something called the elevate series. So, me and a fellow global shaper, we're co-leading that together. And we did a pilot with an NGO in India. And the idea was to basically provide skills training around building better resumes, presentations, social media skills using CANVA. And it was so interesting to see over the span of two days, we were able to reach 160 girls in 23 countries. And we never expected that. So, I'm glad to see that it is an initiative that has the potential to grow and create more sustainable impact. And that's what I love about the community as well. Fantastic. What are some nuggets of wisdom that you can provide for young entrepreneurs that are just young people in general that are looking to affect so called change, that are looking to make an impact either in their local community or broader than that? You know, we humbly forgot to mention that you were chosen for Forbes 30 under 30 for the amazing work that you're doing. But I'd love to hear a little bit about your insights as to how other young people can get involved with similar initiatives. Honestly, I feel like if you are passionate about something and you believe in your idea, then first things first is actually lay out a budget. That's the first thing to do. Put a budget down, see if this is something that can be viable. Especially because, you know, you do want to create impact in the world, but you also need to know how to survive. Without being able to survive, you won't be able to affect that change at a larger scale. So, yes, start at the grassroots level, but first things first, lay down a budget. See if this is a viable project, see if there is a way to put it out, and then create a good story around it. Because, yes, you can talk numbers and numbers are very important, but in order to get people to invest in you and believe in your idea, you also need to know how to communicate your vision properly to others. So, I think it's very important to kind of combine those two skills together. So, balancing storytelling with the numbers that you have in place that show that this is a big problem out there and there is a viable solution which you want to provide. And finally, I would say one in first things first invest in yourself, learn as much as possible. I went in completely blind. I was a first line entrepreneur. I had no idea how to do any of this stuff, but I had a great set of mentors. And honestly, because of them, I've been able to come this far. So, network, find yourself good mentors who can guide you in the right direction and do a lot of research and start reaching out to the right networks as well. Because especially if you're a young entrepreneur, you want to meet people that are also young entrepreneurs that have gone along a similar journey and who understand the process and who can guide you. So, do your research, get access to networks like One Young World. One Young World is a brilliant platform for you to connect with young innovators who are facilitating change around the world. So, reach out to networks like One Young World, reach out to networks like the Global Shapers community. Try to identify more networks that you can be a part of where you can connect with people. Randomly cold call. What's the worst that can happen? I mean, somebody will say no, that's it. It's okay if someone says no, no problem. Just move on to the next thing. But keep them posted on what's happening, obviously, because, one, when you're company starts to grow, it will be likely that they will come back and reach out themselves. So, it may be a closed door now, but it'll open up at a later stage. So, don't be deterred by a no in any way. Frankly, I got so many no's in 2017, but, and obviously there were self-doubt moments as well. I was like, oh my God, am I doing this the right way? I don't know what's going on. But you know one yes can really change the entire game. I love that. Spandana, thank you so much for being so kind with your time. This was really wonderful. Before we leave, I have to ask you the most difficult and most important question, which is three words that we'd use to describe yourself. That's a very interesting one. It is a tough one. That's like the most difficult one, I would say. Right. I'm a people person. So, very friendly, empathetic. I am also very diverse as a person. I know diverse is not exactly like a proper adjective, but I would say diversity is a big part of me based on so many different factors. So, diversity. And curious. I would say I'm curious. Yeah, curious. Thank you so much for joining me here, this was wonderful. I can't wait to share this with the world. And I can't wait to have more interaction both between the nations, but also maintaining this connection and keeping open doors and then potentially working together sometimes. So, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you so much for having me. Take care. Bye.
