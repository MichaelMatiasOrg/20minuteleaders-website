1
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:01,332
Professor Edison Tse, nice to have you here

2
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,099
on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,532
Thank you. Yeah. Nice to talk to you here.

4
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:06,232
Thank you.

5
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:07,832
So, I've had the unique pleasure of being

6
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,799
in your class most recently at Stanford.

7
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,132
The masters in Management and Engineering.

8
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:16,499
MS&E 274.

9
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,832
And you're a world expert.

10
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,666
On your product management.

11
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,266
Thinking strategically about

12
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:23,732
entrepreneurial strategy.

13
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:24,966
The inventor of the

14
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:26,899
grabber-holder dynamics strategy.

15
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,899
And I'd love to spend these next 20 minutes

16
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,399
in sort of peeking your brain.

17
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,899
And trying to consolidate some of

18
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,599
what we've learned over the past 10 weeks.

19
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,166
It's gonna be an impossible feat.

20
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,666
But we'll try as much as we can.

21
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,066
So, can you just start telling me

22
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:40,799
a little bit about yourself.

23
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,632
How did you even get to this

24
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:44,732
incredible incredible industry?

25
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:46,566
Okay.

26
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:48,266
Well, I'm starting a little bit about myself.

27
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:52,999
I'm actually a, my training is electric engineering.

28
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,099
So, I got a PhD in Electric Engineering from MIT.

29
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,866
So, my area's actually in System and Control.

30
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:02,899
And I've been a doing a lot of work in the area.

31
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,099
Getting some awards and things like that.

32
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,266
But, I'm sort of start interested in something.

33
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,966
I wanna do the system in control.

34
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:12,166
They are all man-made. Right?

35
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:13,699
System things like that.

36
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,899
Well, I started in the system where

37
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,832
you have a lot of human.

38
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,532
A lot of people. Right?

39
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:27,066
So, I start to work in the industry

40
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,832
for many years.

41
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,566
And then I start coming back to Stanford.

42
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:32,099
But going actually not to

43
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,966
Electric Engineering Department.

44
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:36,432
But going into beginning is the

45
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:38,032
Engineering Economic Systems.

46
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:40,632
Where we are looking at systems

47
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:43,532
that are can be human system,

48
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:45,499
can be you know, it’s a combination of

49
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,532
human system and the engineering system.

50
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:51,332
So, it can be that it's an interaction of

51
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,166
all the system that make me do it.

52
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,366
And I'm also interested in some of the

53
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:56,799
economics as part of it.

54
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,299
So that’s how I get started.

55
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,832
Then to some work,

56
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:04,299
for example managing fisheries.

57
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,166
And some of the natural resources.

58
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,532
And things like that.

59
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,032
Well, I got also interested in business because

60
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:14,299
I got my ex-boss asked me

61
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,866
to join his company.

62
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:21,332
We started a company but I was faculty member.

63
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,199
So I say, "I can’t join the company."

64
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,166
Where were you already a faculty member?

65
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:25,732
At Stanford?

66
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,099
Yeah. I was a faculty at Stanford.

67
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,866
And so, I said, "I would not be able to join the company."

68
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:31,266
But he said,

69
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,132
"Well you don’t have to join the company.

70
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:34,866
Well you can be a consultant. Right?"

71
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:36,499
And so, to be a consultant.

72
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,299
To be a co-founder.

73
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,366
As a consultant.

74
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:40,199
And I say, "What? That's interesting. Go"

75
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,766
So, I get into it.

76
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,266
So, we build a company.

77
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:44,866
Which is in the very beginning,

78
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:45,932
it's actually Org company.

79
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:48,432
And the first wave of AI,

80
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:49,699
we're doing some of the work in there.

81
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,699
Okay.

82
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,366
So, it's a more technology-driven.

83
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:53,866
And we do a lot of technology work.

84
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:54,932
And things like that.

85
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:56,832
But I start yet because I was

86
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,932
I played a role as not only a consultant.

87
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:00,799
I was on the bot.

88
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,232
So, I got a start understanding on

89
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:04,999
what's happening in the business world.

90
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,166
The dynamics of an entrepreneur.

91
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:10,299
So that I got interested in entrepreneurship.

92
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,132
Part of it.

93
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:13,532
So, I was doing,

94
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,799
And then I come to Stanford

95
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,366
I still want to continue doing work at Stanford.

96
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:20,032
So, I start my interest.

97
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:21,466
My interest has shifted.

98
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:22,899
Because of that.

99
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,366
From a little bit of economics

100
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:26,832
and go into the business world.

101
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:30,332
That's how I get started.

102
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,266
Okay.

103
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:35,432
And in the very beginning my research

104
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:37,066
are more on the system part.

105
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:39,366
Where I was also looking at business

106
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:40,366
as an overall system.

107
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:41,932
Interesting.

108
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:44,799
So, thinking from the system point of view,

109
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,699
How the system point of view looking at

110
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,866
from the business organization. Right?

111
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,332
You're gonna think of system organization

112
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,232
really a system.

113
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,899
So, that the electrical engineer part of you

114
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,099
that's trying to scope business as another.

115
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,166
Yes. Yeah.

116
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:00,466
And then I knew that in engineering,

117
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:03,299
the engineer big thing and engineer as well

118
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,799
in control. It's feedback. Right?

119
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,499
Feedback control is a big thing.

120
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,799
But the feedback control is always

121
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,466
you try to stabilize the system.

122
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:15,066
But I said, "Well, if you look at the business,

123
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:16,532
you actually don’t want to be

124
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:17,499
stabilizing the system.

125
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,299
You want to un-stabilize the system.

126
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,066
Because you wanna grow. Right?

127
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,432
Grow is not stabilizing.

128
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:25,932
So, what I'm saying that actually in business

129
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:27,666
what you need is not negative feedback.

130
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:28,732
You want positive feedback.

131
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:31,932
So that's the whole concept.

132
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:32,899
Of what Ecom is.

133
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,632
So, what is the passive feedback?

134
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:37,266
A positive feedback is something

135
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,032
that excites you.

136
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:39,832
And then you have something supporting you.

137
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,899
And then you create a exponential growth.

138
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:48,366
That's where from the engineering point of view.

139
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:51,399
And so, you know I'm very curious about

140
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,666
this grabber-holder dynamics.

141
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,032
Which we've talked about extensively

142
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:55,999
over the past 10 weeks.

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,499
And I think it's fascinating how it defines

144
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,532
so much of also what we're seeing now.

145
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:02,732
You know covid has taken over.

146
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:05,099
And a lot of what I'm seeing now in the way

147
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,332
the companies are approaching this.

148
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,632
And a lot of the innovations

149
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:08,299
that are coming about.

150
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,132
I keep trying to classify them.

151
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,199
How are they strategizing

152
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,132
and positioning themselves within this

153
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:14,966
grabber-holder dynamics.

154
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:17,366
So, could you give us a slight introduction

155
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:19,099
into what is this dynamic

156
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,066
that is not so popular?

157
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:21,632
Right.

158
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:24,166
So, how do you create a positive dynamic?

159
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:27,199
The behavior of course of dynamic

160
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,299
from the engineering term is that

161
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,199
you are creating eigenvalue was positive,

162
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,532
in some way.

163
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:34,432
That is from a mathematical point of view.

164
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:36,266
But how do you translate that

165
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:37,732
into the business point of view.

166
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:40,632
I say it must be something that solve

167
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:41,632
in largely for that.

168
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:44,132
It was something that [--]

169
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:48,066
So, what you wanna do is that your business,

170
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,132
you're gonna grab it.

171
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:51,466
You're gonna go excited in a certain way.

172
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:52,866
And then you're gonna find something to hold it.

173
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:55,199
And that's how the grabber-holding come along.

174
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,999
And one of the disruption is that

175
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,566
there are forces that sort of creating new forces

176
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,799
that could kick you in a certain direction.

177
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,566
Right? It's a huge force.

178
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:06,899
So, what you can do using

179
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,199
a grabber-holder dynamics is

180
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,432
you can think of all those forces

181
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:11,366
like whatever. Right?

182
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:12,232
They are actually,

183
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:14,466
they’re pushing you at a certain direction.

184
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:16,832
But it will not stay there.

185
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:20,532
Because when the forces go away, you fall back.

186
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,432
But if you're gonna hold it.

187
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:25,332
Then you create a new situation.

188
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,932
So, I'm saying for example,

189
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:28,866
you take the covid situation

190
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:31,732
the covid situation actually are

191
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:33,299
are sort of that kick you

192
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,966
in a certain so that you shifted your preference.

193
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:39,266
Shift it your way like what is the right way

194
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:39,832
of doing things.

195
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,732
And sometimes, it may allow you

196
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:47,199
to create a different kind of a value structure.

197
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,166
For example, a lot of people find that

198
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:52,166
because of this covid-19. Right?

199
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:56,032
People actually find new value in family.

200
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:59,599
They revisit the value of family.

201
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,899
They revisit the value of community.

202
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,832
Right.

203
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,266
Which they have lost.

204
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:05,166
You know.

205
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,632
They're too busy. They lost it.

206
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:11,466
But then, in order for that to sustain,

207
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:12,999
that means that if you can have something

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,699
that hold it,

209
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,232
then it become,

210
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:18,299
even that the covid-19 is gone,

211
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,632
you still have this value let's say sustaining.

212
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:23,666
The question is,

213
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,266
What are those thing you need to build up

214
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,932
so that you can support it? Right?

215
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:28,232
The way you're saying is that,

216
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:31,566
the way that the grabbing works is sort of like

217
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:32,399
a kick in the stomach.

218
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,532
And okay we're shifting

219
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:34,966
the consumer behavior in one way.

220
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:36,099
Whether it's an invention.

221
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,499
Or if it's a global pandemic.

222
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,199
Exactly.

223
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,932
And we've attained this new behavior.

224
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:41,632
We've shifted.

225
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:43,099
The consumers have shifted the mindset,

226
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,699
the values, their desires, etc.

227
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,699
Now the question is,

228
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,399
How do we hold or retain these values?

229
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,532
Retain that. Because if you could not retain it,

230
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:52,832
then we'll bounce it back.

231
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:53,999
Right.

232
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,399
So, a good case for this would be,

233
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,566
well so, Zoom for example enjoyed a lot

234
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:01,699
of this new type of consumer interaction.

235
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,132
And a lot of people are wondering.

236
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:05,399
Well now things are starting to open up again.

237
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,432
And hopefully soon everything will open up.

238
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:10,499
And are we retaining this consumer behavior?

239
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,032
Exactly.

240
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:12,299
or virtual conflict,

241
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,199
For example, if Zoom can do something

242
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,732
to make you feel that even you're back

243
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:19,999
to normal life, you still find new value in there.

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,232
And then if I can build certain thing

245
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:24,132
that allows that, that's what I called a holder.

246
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:26,266
And so, the holder is something you build

247
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:26,832
afterwards.

248
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:31,299
After you see what the grabber is pushing you.

249
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,866
So, building the holder is more like you know,

250
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:36,932
you do it in time.

251
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:39,666
It's not something that you can foresee.

252
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,566
So, you just have to play along.

253
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:42,699
It's more adaptive.

254
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,899
It is more, you know you have to build up

255
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,832
as you go on.

256
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,432
That's the whole concept. Right?

257
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,966
So, what are some examples

258
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,132
of grabber-holder dynamics that we

259
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:52,699
can see over the past, I don’t know,

260
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,466
half a century for example?

261
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:54,599
Well, there's a lot.

262
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,932
Almost everything is sort of,

263
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:58,332
like you start to have a grabber

264
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,399
and then you start having a holder.

265
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,332
I give a few sort of example. Right?

266
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:08,899
You know for example,

267
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,999
we're talking about PC, right?

268
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,266
PC is a typical grabber-holder dynamic concept.

269
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:15,499
Right?

270
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,166
The idea is that I'm gonna have a computer

271
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:18,866
for everybody.

272
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:20,599
So, sounds like a great idea.

273
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,499
Okay. And suddenly, in the beginning

274
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,432
nobody knows what that does mean. Right?

275
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:27,499
Just, they know what's a computer. Right?

276
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,766
They know a little bit about computer.

277
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:29,532
They know the main frame.

278
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:30,666
Just do a lot of calculation.

279
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:31,832
That's too complicated.

280
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:32,732
Too big things. Right?

281
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:33,566
Too many things.

282
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,032
Right.

283
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:35,566
And if you ask them what is V-dot

284
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:36,699
and nobody knows. Right?

285
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,699
So, in the very beginning,

286
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,066
you see what a computer is,

287
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:41,599
it's a little box that can do a calculation.

288
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,899
And then some time when you turn off

289
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,599
the electricity, everything is gone. Right?

290
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,699
That is, oh wow, that's not good. Right?

291
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,699
So, it's exciting.

292
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,732
I can use that to make calculation.

293
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:54,366
But all the calculation that I make it's all gone.

294
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,366
That's were in the very beginning.

295
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:58,666
The first PC doesn’t have a memory.

296
00:13:58,667 --> 00:13:59,732
Interesting.

297
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:01,099
Okay. So, what did they do?

298
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,499
They attached a recorder.

299
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,266
Tape recorder.

300
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:10,699
Like a regular tape recorder attached to a PC.

301
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,132
So that you can record [--]

302
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:15,566
But then you have the search rules.

303
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:17,366
It's very complicated. Right?

304
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:19,332
And that's why they get good at least tried, right?

305
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,932
That's where I comes in because

306
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:22,232
they see a need that I have to do

307
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:23,966
all the computation or I'm gonna put it.

308
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:25,466
Right?

309
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:27,399
We know that the big computer they can do it.

310
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,066
But when you're little box,

311
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:30,266
you say personal computer,

312
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:31,232
I saw small,

313
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:32,232
should I have it or not?

314
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:33,866
Nobody know in the very beginning.

315
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:35,432
So, sort of trial and errors.

316
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:37,732
And you may say that the first success

317
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:39,632
of Apple too is because

318
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:41,266
they attached to it with this drive.

319
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:44,032
Okay. Okay.

320
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:46,666
Was that the whole perspective of it?

321
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:47,699
That's the whole perspective.

322
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,699
And you know this. Right?

323
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,199
People find you near this right.

324
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,332
Well, also you need to have some

325
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,966
computation or two.

326
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:55,432
Because it's your computer.

327
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:57,266
You know no one is gonna do

328
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:58,866
write the programming.

329
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:01,466
And at that time, Apple too become successful.

330
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,566
It's mainly because,

331
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:04,766
then there were star,

332
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:07,766
And the vesicle comes in.

333
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:10,199
That allow you to do while processing,

334
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,032
have a letter

335
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:11,999
and things like that.

336
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,899
Vesicle allow you to do

337
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,499
simple calculation and accounting.

338
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,932
And that's being successful.

339
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:21,266
And that's the holder. Right?

340
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:22,732
Definitely.

341
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:23,299
Okay.

342
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,432
So, you have that example

343
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:27,632
and I'd love to talk also about retail.

344
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:29,832
And that specifically I'm interested

345
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,466
because that was my--

346
00:15:31,467 --> 00:15:32,966
I give you a very interesting example. Right.

347
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:33,799
yeah. Please.

348
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,599
Okay. The other interesting example is Alibaba.

349
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,899
Okay. Yeah.

350
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,732
Very relevant. Yes.

351
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:39,666
Okay.

352
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:41,066
Now, Alibaba was started of,

353
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:46,599
Alibaba start fooling around in the net.

354
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,899
But in the very beginning,

355
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,699
they are helping American firm

356
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,599
to source a product in China.

357
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,932
That's how they do it. Right?

358
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,966
It's more like a B2B. Right?

359
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:58,099
They're sourcing.

360
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,966
They're helping you.

361
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:01,366
Actually they're not helping you to source.

362
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:03,332
You just go in and find information.

363
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,299
Okay, you want a visor and thing.

364
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,166
I can tell who are the manufacturer.

365
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,499
That's they start in the very beginning.

366
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:10,999
Okay?

367
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,732
That means they keep going wrong.

368
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:14,932
Okay.

369
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,566
Then Amazon started in the US.

370
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:20,466
And sort of E-commerce has start in the US.

371
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:22,799
And they are successful.

372
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,266
An e-commerce and

373
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:27,232
And eBay they all come go to China.

374
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:28,566
And want to do it in China.

375
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,266
Then Alibaba say,

376
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:31,832
"Wow. I can do that too." Right?

377
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,699
You know, sort of similar thing.

378
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,666
And maybe I should also set up

379
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:37,699
something like this.

380
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,966
Okay.

381
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:40,266
But on the other hand.

382
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:42,199
One of the things is that,

383
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,999
if you want to do e-commerce,

384
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,666
Right? So, what is a holder?

385
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,532
What is the holder?

386
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:48,666
What is the holder, right?

387
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:49,532
One is that,

388
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:50,632
Why would people want

389
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:55,932
to come to the computer to buy thing?

390
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,666
Is that the normal thing that people do?

391
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:59,199
No. The answer is no. Yeah.

392
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,599
Maybe some young kids would try.

393
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,432
Back then it wasn’t right.

394
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:03,466
Yeah. At that time. Right?

395
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:05,932
Maybe some young kid would try it.

396
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:08,699
Everybody has computer in China.

397
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,599
Right. Okay.

398
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,032
So, where's the holder? Right?

399
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:13,932
The holder is that you need to have a computer

400
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,866
or that somebody need to have that computer.

401
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,166
But on the other hand,

402
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,766
Also, what you need is that

403
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:20,499
how are you gonna pay?

404
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,466
Okay? Right.

405
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:25,132
And the third is that

406
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:26,032
how I trust you.

407
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:28,066
You know, why do I wanna buy it in there?

408
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:29,699
Because if I buy some anything,

409
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,566
it's not useful,

410
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:33,132
then what? Right?

411
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:34,032
Yeah.

412
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:36,032
In US, you know

413
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:38,899
this becomes take off for several reason.

414
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,999
I think the holder is there.

415
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,299
Okay, in the US,

416
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,566
how do you solve the problem of payment?

417
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:47,932
Well you can have credit card.

418
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,766
You can scan your credit card or whatever.

419
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,466
Even there are PayPal,

420
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:53,999
but they start off with credit card.

421
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,332
So, people can pay thru credit card.

422
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,299
Right.

423
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,432
So, I solved the problem of payment.

424
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:01,166
Well, how do I trust it?

425
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:03,966
Well in US they have the consumer protection.

426
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:06,899
US have very high consumer protection.

427
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,599
So that if you don't like it,

428
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,432
you can return it.

429
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:10,899
Yup. Okay.

430
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,932
Then you have to accept the return then.

431
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:16,532
So, that means that in the US the holder is there.

432
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,532
Right. Okay?

433
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:21,199
But Professor, it sounds also that

434
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,966
from a lot of people--

435
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:22,499
But in China it's not there

436
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,499
Yeah.

437
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,232
So, it sounds that in order for a company

438
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:28,699
like eBay or Amazon to become a holder

439
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:34,666
of this new user experience they were helped by,

440
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:35,932
They need to deal with the two problem. Right?

441
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:38,566
And they didn’t deal with them on their own.

442
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:40,032
They had the government

443
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:42,799
and the payment system deal with them

444
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,199
for them. Right?

445
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,399
They didn’t do this on their own.

446
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,166
Because that means that the US

447
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,932
all have already the infrastructure.

448
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:48,766
Right.

449
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:49,266
That allow you to do it.

450
00:18:49,267 --> 00:18:51,866
And that sometime people can return.

451
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:52,966
But in China,

452
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,566
in developing countries sometimes

453
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:57,132
they give a term called Institutional Void.

454
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,966
There's some institutional void.

455
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:00,899
And that's exactly what happened in China.

456
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,632
There's institutional void in China.

457
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:04,066
The credit card system.

458
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:05,999
There's no credit ranking system.

459
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,932
There's more wreck in credit assessment system.

460
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:14,732
So, there's not a lot of credit card [--].

461
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,632
Most of the credit card is [--]

462
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:18,299
in China are all those

463
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,432
very famous millionaires.

464
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:21,666
Right? Sure.

465
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:26,499
But young people they will not have one. Right?

466
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,399
But all the rich people in China

467
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,032
they're not gonna buy thing on themselves.

468
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:31,932
On their own.

469
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:33,632
So then they are not the shopper.

470
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:35,666
So they have the credit card.

471
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:36,532
But they are not the shopper.

472
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:38,532
The shopper are the one who didn’t really

473
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:39,232
have the credit card.

474
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:43,232
So it sounds also when you talk about timing,

475
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:44,966
how timing is important for a startup

476
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:46,132
or for any entrepreneur.

477
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:46,766
Exactly.

478
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:48,366
You have a load of situation over there. Right?

479
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:52,332
So, the other thing is that

480
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,766
it is trust problem.

481
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:59,466
Because in China if you buy certain thing,

482
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:01,032
if you don’t like it, you cannot return it.

483
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,566
Okay?

484
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,166
People will not return it.

485
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:06,366
And they will not accept it.

486
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:10,132
And there's no law to protect you.

487
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:12,466
Okay? So, you cannot sue them or whatever.

488
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:13,232
You cannot do that.

489
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:15,232
So, therefore how do you solve that problem?

490
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:21,666
And this is how Alibaba becomes successful.

491
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,699
So, how do they solve it?

492
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,232
How do they solve it?

493
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:26,499
Okay. The way they solve it is to say

494
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,599
we're build up something called escrow system.

495
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,399
Like US they have escrow system.

496
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,332
What escrow system is that,

497
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,066
you buy certain thing,

498
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:42,099
a certain amount you pay into Alibaba.

499
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,999
Alibaba will gonna be the escrow,

500
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,066
they gonna hold it.

501
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:49,499
They are not gonna release it to the seller.

502
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,766
And then they tell the seller that the buyer

503
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:55,032
have already paid and you can ship it to him.

504
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:56,999
Right. Okay?

505
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,532
And they ship it to the buyer.

506
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:02,966
And the buyer have seven days to see,

507
00:21:02,967 --> 00:21:04,766
to examine the thing.

508
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:06,266
And within seven days,

509
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:08,699
they can return it to Alibaba.

510
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,232
And Alibaba will ship it back to the seller.

511
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:13,599
And return the money back to the buyer.

512
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,499
So that means that they are the middle man

513
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,166
that keep track on that. Right?

514
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:19,832
That's a lot of logistics to solve

515
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:20,099
the certain problem.

516
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,166
There's a lot of logistics to do. right?

517
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:22,399
Not only that.

518
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,866
They say no fee.

519
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:25,499
No fee.

520
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,399
No fee.

521
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,999
So, that means that if you return,

522
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,232
doesn’t cost you anything.

523
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:31,299
Interesting.

524
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,832
So that obviously is very--

525
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,566
So, an Amazon it's different.

526
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:39,499
Because you actually pay in advance.

527
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,699
You already pay for the product.

528
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,599
But you have so much trust in the system.

529
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,632
That you know you can just return it.

530
00:21:44,633 --> 00:21:45,666
Right? Two things.

531
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:47,299
Because in the credit card system,

532
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,799
if you don’t like it,

533
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,599
you can complain to the credit card

534
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,999
and credit card gonna report it.

535
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,399
But you know that's interesting.

536
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,632
That's already start up in the US. Right?

537
00:21:56,633 --> 00:21:58,666
And then you have platform like Upwork,

538
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:00,132
which is for freelancers,

539
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:03,299
where you actually keep the money in escrow,

540
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,066
it's all virtual.

541
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:06,732
There’s no tangible services.

542
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:09,999
It's all hypothetical work to be done.

543
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,932
Like please put in data.

544
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:13,299
Do a research project for me.

545
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,966
Not that I would ever do that for the Stanford

546
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:15,632
of course.

547
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:16,832
But then,

548
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,432
once I put the money in escrow,

549
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:20,332
The freelancer can perform the work.

550
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,566
And only once I'm satisfied.

551
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:23,532
The money gets released.

552
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:26,132
Which leaves room for negotiation.

553
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:28,999
Because it's so subjective on what are the goods.

554
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,866
And you're quality of the goods.

555
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:32,299
That's exactly what's happening. Right?

556
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,599
So, that's exactly what Alibaba did.

557
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,266
But I think the interesting part

558
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:40,399
what they did is that I charged it free.

559
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,899
Then you say,

560
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,432
Why are they keeping the money?

561
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:46,232
Here's an interesting part.

562
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:49,332
The seven day where the money is in Alibaba,

563
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,966
he would put it into the money market.

564
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:54,666
And earns of interest.

565
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:56,899
And that's how they pay for it.

566
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,766
This is in a gray area. Right?

567
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:02,066
Because it's not your money.

568
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:03,532
Right. Yeah?

569
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:04,399
It's not your money.

570
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,066
But then if you have a lot of money coming in,

571
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,499
then you can become at par.

572
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,799
But then they very quickly shift it

573
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,032
into set up another thing called

574
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:16,299
an extra money account.

575
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,366
That means that I can put money in there

576
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:23,266
and the money would be used for helping you.

577
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:25,699
I would make them interest for you.

578
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,432
And they keep a little bit.

579
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:29,166
And anytime you want to buy thing

580
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:29,732
you can use that money.

581
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:31,466
So, they solve the problem very quickly.

582
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:32,766
After a while.

583
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:36,166
So, they use a gray area to move in. Okay?

584
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:39,632
So that's the part they solve that holder.

585
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:41,332
But there's another great holder.

586
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,166
It's very important.

587
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:45,166
it's why would people buy thing on the internet?

588
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:47,399
Okay?

589
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,099
Now, it turns out that if you look at the timing,

590
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,599
it turns out they start taking off in year 2003.

591
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,166
Okay.

592
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,732
What is the significant of that?

593
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:59,566
In year 2003,

594
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:01,299
SARS appear in China.

595
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,299
Like a covid-19.

596
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:09,299
Because of SARS, many place are in lockdown.

597
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,532
Especially in Beijing.

598
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:15,366
And then our people still have to buy thing.

599
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:16,066
What do they do?

600
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:17,499
They go to the internet.

601
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,766
I love it. Okay?

602
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:21,899
Now, whether without that

603
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,699
that will happen or not, I don’t know.

604
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,166
Because history didn’t tell us.

605
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:27,832
I mean, I cannot run back the history.

606
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:31,366
But I can say that it has something to do with it

607
00:24:31,367 --> 00:24:33,266
because it helped to change

608
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:35,399
people’s preference in buying.

609
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,899
o, that's why I'm talking in to you guys

610
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,332
that in covid-19,

611
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:42,599
we have a lot of things gonna happen.

612
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,899
If you learn from the Alibaba example.

613
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,432
That means that the’re new things

614
00:24:47,433 --> 00:24:47,932
that gonna open up.

615
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:50,732
If you can see what its leading to.

616
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:52,466
And there's actually,

617
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:54,466
There's another company called JayD.

618
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:56,899
It's actually that company

619
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,432
JayD started of is that he is only a,

620
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:03,099
he have a retail store

621
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,366
selling electronic equipment in Beijing.

622
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,666
And because of SARS,

623
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:13,166
he actually moved that into the internet.

624
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:14,799
That means that there are

625
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,966
certainly something that are happening there.

626
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:18,266
JayD is now one of the largest

627
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,566
e-commerce in China.

628
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:21,632
It's unbelievable.

629
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:23,899
And Jack Ma's story aside from all that

630
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,099
is just so phenomenal by itself.

631
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,866
And I think what's really really incredible

632
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:30,132
and very reflective on what we’ve done

633
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:31,732
over these past 10 weeks is that

634
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:33,732
understanding how dynamic this world is.

635
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:34,899
And how is an entrepreneur,

636
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,566
You can have an amazing idea

637
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:37,232
with amazing execution.

638
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:38,466
But if you're not dynamic,

639
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:40,232
And if you're not thinking about market forces,

640
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:41,599
and how everything is changing,

641
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,566
then you're not setting yourself off for success.

642
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:46,032
And especially today,

643
00:25:46,033 --> 00:25:47,199
with things changing so fast.

644
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,399
I just heard a podcast that

645
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,632
Instacart, the grocery shopping application,

646
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:56,199
they've reached their financial milestone

647
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,132
that they predicted for 2024.

648
00:25:58,133 --> 00:26:01,999
Now you would think that in 2020 would

649
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,066
so many smart people working

650
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:05,132
on this billion-dollar company,

651
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:07,899
they’d be able to predict their sales over years.

652
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,099
And it just shows how something happens

653
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,266
to the world, markets shift, consumers shift.

654
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:13,432
Who would have guess that

655
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:15,899
they would have had a three-year

656
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,166
or four years advancement

657
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:19,899
in just a matter of weeks.

658
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,666
I can’t believe our time is almost up

659
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:22,599
and Professor I know you have

660
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,832
to go to your next meeting already.

661
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,166
But I have to leave with one last question.

662
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,466
Three words that you would best

663
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:29,199
describe yourself.

664
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,932
Or any of your colleagues at Stanford

665
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:33,366
would describe you as.

666
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:36,132
Well, I don’t know.

667
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:38,866
The hardest question.

668
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:40,366
The hardest questions.

669
00:26:40,367 --> 00:26:41,232
I think that,

670
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:45,566
I would like to,

671
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:47,332
my interest, my desire

672
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:49,466
is to,

673
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:50,932
three things right.

674
00:26:50,933 --> 00:26:56,232
I feel that entrepreneur is culture dependent.

675
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:57,599
Okay?

676
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,599
In different parts of the world.

677
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,099
You have a different kind

678
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,532
of entrepreneur activity,

679
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:03,766
a different kind of innovation.

680
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:07,166
And so, the innovation are cultural dependent.

681
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,932
So, that means that whatever,

682
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:12,566
And each part of the world with

683
00:27:12,567 --> 00:27:15,199
culture background they have actually

684
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,766
different compatible advantage

685
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:21,832
in deriving certain type of innovation.

686
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:26,966
And so, I believe that people should collaborate.

687
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:29,166
Worldwide collaboration and innovation.

688
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:31,366
I think the past in this part.

689
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:33,966
And the whole idea that innovation

690
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:37,032
is creating value to the world.

691
00:27:37,033 --> 00:27:39,932
And so, maybe I would like to describe me

692
00:27:39,933 --> 00:27:45,999
as like to promote global innovation

693
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,399
to increase the wellbeing,

694
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,866
or livelihood of everybody in the world.

695
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:56,766
I love it so much.

696
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:58,866
Professor, thank you so much for your time--

697
00:27:58,867 --> 00:28:00,732
I think I'm more than three words.

698
00:28:00,733 --> 00:28:04,532
I'll take because it was just too inspiring.

699
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:05,832
Professor, thank you for the last 10 weeks.

700
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:09,466
Thank you for teaching us all about

701
00:28:09,467 --> 00:28:10,632
dynamic entrepreneurial strategy

702
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:11,332
and I look forward to taking

703
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,266
more classes with you.

704
00:28:12,267 --> 00:28:14,466
Okay. Great. I’ll see you.

705
