1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,120
We saved it for the last minute to go,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,520
oh, maybe we should call a data vendor

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,720
and see if we can subscribe

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,760
to some of these data feeds,

5
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,585
which was an absolutely deadly mistake.

6
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,960
Rachel Carpenter, thank you so much

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,640
for being on my show.

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,480
How are you?

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:43,880
I'm great.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,560
How are you doing?

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,240
Thanks for having me.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,840
Of course, it's great to have you.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm very excited to hear about

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,360
the story of Intrinio.

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,560
And going, I think,

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,200
all the way back to 2012, right?

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,240
I heard you on another podcast mentioned

18
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,960
starting out in a pretty interesting way

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,840
and going through the journey

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,680
of understanding

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,760
the different limitations

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,360
and working in the

23
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,760
financial services space

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,840
and running a high tech company.

25
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,040
But let's go all the way

26
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,720
to the beginning.

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,520
Who is Rachel Carpenter

28
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,640
and why start a high tech venture?

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,720
Great question.

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,920
Rachel Carpenter was actually

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,040
originally a musical theater major.

32
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,440
Believe it or not.

33
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,720
Ended up founding a data company,

34
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,720
which is a wide swing.

35
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,360
But I grew up in Wisconsin.

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,600
And I went to

37
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,520
University of Wisconsin, Madison.

38
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,000
And I ended up getting dual degrees

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,120
in finance and entrepreneurship.

40
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,360
And

41
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,040
part of what I went through in college

42
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,280
was recognizing that I never wanted

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,800
to work for somebody else ever again.

44
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,600
In my entire life.

45
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,160
I had a pretty bad college level job.

46
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,680
So, I knew I wanted

47
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,320
to be an entrepreneur.

48
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,200
I didn't know exactly

49
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,880
what I wanted to do yet.

50
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,240
And so, I met my co-founder

51
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,800
while I was in college.

52
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
He was a CPA and I was studying finance.

53
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,840
So, we had a lot of background

54
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,200
in that space.

55
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,960
And the original business concept

56
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,800
that we decided to go after

57
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,720
was actually an online valuation engine.

58
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,520
So, to do business valuations

59
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,560
and assess business model,

60
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,360
we wanted to build the software online.

61
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,840
Where to start,

62
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,240
you would just kind of type in a ticker

63
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,960
of any stock you were interested in

64
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,360
and it would tell you,

65
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,880
it would run a valuation

66
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,520
and then tell you,

67
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,400
is the stock overvalued, undervalued,

68
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,120
Is it a strong buy or sell.

69
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,520
We wanted to kind

70
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,680
of build this stock app,

71
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,320
this investing tool.

72
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,880
And so, I came from a background

73
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,200
that was not technical at all.

74
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,520
But I'd always loved math

75
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,080
and I kind of fell in love with finance

76
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,640
because of that.

77
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,280
And that's why I studied that.

78
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,720
So, part of it what we went through

79
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,240
was recognizing this is very complex.

80
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
If we are going to build

81
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,120
a stock app like this,

82
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,440
we probably need to learn how to program

83
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,400
to get it off the ground on our own.

84
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,800
And so, I took a year,

85
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,040
and between my co-founder and I,

86
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,560
we learned Ruby for the back end

87
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,440
and some of the front end

88
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,880
programming languages

89
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,280
that we needed to get this thing built.

90
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,280
And so, I went through this journey

91
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,640
of teaching myself how to program.

92
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,880
I was sleeping on a couch.

93
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,000
We were making no money.

94
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,040
It was very uncomfortable.

95
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,160
And we ended up building this thing.

96
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,080
The problem was that

97
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,920
we were illegally screen scraping data

98
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,320
from ten thousand websites.

99
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,680
Wait. So, before we get

100
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,440
we get into all this illegal fun stuff,

101
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,520
that decision to go

102
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,160
and teach yourself how to program,

103
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,240
you and your co-founder,

104
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,320
it's very unusual.

105
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,280
In the sense that

106
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,920
a lot of the stories that I hear

107
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,000
and that I meet are entrepreneurs.

108
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They might not even be coming

109
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,080
from the tech background

110
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,200
or the computer science background,

111
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,680
but they have this great idea

112
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,360
that could be a software solution,

113
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,560
and then they go and they find people

114
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,280
to build that for them,

115
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,160
but they don't necessarily

116
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
teach themselves how to code.

117
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,080
I'm a coder myself,

118
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,640
and I advocate for learning how to code.

119
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,280
But tell me about that,

120
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
that critical moment

121
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,320
where you're deciding to take

122
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,640
that whole year,

123
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,960
a very expensive year.

124
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,400
Not just because

125
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,120
you're not making any money,

126
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,920
but because you want to get moving

127
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,640
with your ideas

128
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,720
and you're choosing to teach yourself

129
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,840
how to code.

130
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,760
Yeah, that's a great question.

131
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,320
And I tend to honestly not recommend it

132
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,280
in most cases.

133
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,600
I mean, you know this, right?

134
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,240
It takes a decade plus

135
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,600
to really become a proficient engineer.

136
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,080
And with most technology startups,

137
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,160
you have a short window

138
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,320
to really beat the competition

139
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,240
and get your product off the ground

140
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,920
so you don't have time typically

141
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
to do that.

142
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,880
And in nine out of ten cases,

143
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,040
I would say, don't learn how to program,

144
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,360
go find a technical co-founder,

145
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,240
go find a team that can do it for you.

146
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,160
Because you would be surprised

147
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,920
how long it takes

148
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,880
to get really, really good.

149
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,960
And I didn't get there.

150
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,720
I got dangerous enough

151
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,680
to get this thing together.

152
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,080
But my CTO today still tells me

153
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,480
he's like when I took over, it was

154
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,360
there was just skeletons left and right

155
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,560
underneath the rug

156
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,000
with the kind of code that I was writing.

157
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,320
Because I wasn't classically trained

158
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,280
and I only had a year under my belt.

159
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,760
So, I don't recommend it in most cases.

160
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,880
I think in our case,

161
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
what we were building

162
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,960
was so iterative and we didn't know

163
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,560
where we were going to end up with it.

164
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,240
And it was so financially complex.

165
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Understanding how to do

166
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,440
a discounted cash flow is hard enough

167
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,640
with just financial knowledge.

168
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,800
And then figuring out

169
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,680
how to program that

170
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,520
and turn it into an app

171
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,440
is a whole different story.

172
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,840
And so, in rare cases, I think,

173
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,040
if the area that you're working in

174
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,440
is super complex

175
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,280
and requires domain expertise,

176
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
it can make sense

177
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,600
and you can actually move faster.

178
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,120
In our case, like we would have literally

179
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
had to have had a CPA

180
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,840
over the shoulder of an engineer.

181
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,400
And that doesn't work very smoothly.

182
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,520
So, there's unique cases like ours

183
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,440
where it did make sense.

184
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,280
The caveat there is that

185
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,520
I had to give it up eventually.

186
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,720
Once we got this thing to the point

187
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,840
where we were moving,

188
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,040
we hired engineers

189
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,080
who had tons of experience

190
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,760
and could really take it

191
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,840
to the next level.

192
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,360
So, if you are in the one out of ten

193
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,960
where it makes sense to learn,

194
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,080
you do have to recognize

195
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,560
that you have to give it up, eventually.

196
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,560
Right. Okay.

197
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,680
So, it's 2012,

198
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,080
and now you're running this

199
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,880
iterative business,

200
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,680
you're figuring stuff out along the way

201
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,480
and you've reach the first roadblock

202
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,800
where you find that you're

203
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,880
illegally scraping data online.

204
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,680
So, talk to me about that junction now.

205
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:44,840
Yeah.

206
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,920
So, any application you're going to build

207
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,000
in the FinTech space,

208
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,680
the raw materials of that industry

209
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,560
are data, right?

210
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,760
I mean, everything runs off of data.

211
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,000
We needed stock prices,

212
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,120
financial statements, earnings estimates,

213
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,840
economic data comps,

214
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,280
we need it for all the stocks

215
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,120
in the universe of the United States.

216
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,240
And so, you know,

217
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,200
places like Yahoo! Finance

218
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,080
or different companies like that

219
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,120
to kind of scrape things down.

220
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,600
But that's it,

221
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,240
you can't publish a product that way

222
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,120
because there's terms of service.

223
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,160
And so, we were,

224
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,840
we were kind of scraping for a while

225
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,880
to get our prototype built.

226
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,640
But when we really wanted

227
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,600
to launch this thing publicly,

228
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,560
we saved it for the last minute to go,

229
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,960
oh, maybe we should call a data vendor

230
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,160
and see if we can subscribe

231
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,200
to some of these data feeds,

232
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,360
which was an absolutely deadly mistake,

233
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,160
because the companies that we had to call

234
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,520
were Bloomberg, Capital IQ,

235
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,560
Thomson Reuters,

236
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,560
these huge, huge companies.

237
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,880
And to put it in perspective,

238
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,000
for the data that we needed

239
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,920
to launch our app,

240
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,240
it was going to cost anywhere between

241
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,720
60 and $70,000 a month to get started.

242
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,440
So, remember, I'm on a couch.

243
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,520
I have no money.

244
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,480
I've just spent this horrible year

245
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,560
draining myself through the dirt,

246
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,320
trying to get started.

247
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,840
It ended everything for us instantly.

248
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,920
There are no economics that work out

249
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,520
for a startup at that stage

250
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,400
to even raise money enough to support

251
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
a $70,000 a month data expense.

252
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,320
So, we were pretty pissed off.

253
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,160
To be honest.

254
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,840
It was not a fun day.

255
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,080
So, you find yourself

256
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,240
with your co-founder.

257
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,920
It's been a year of struggling

258
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,600
and running this iterative business.

259
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,160
You finally reach some sort of product

260
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,880
that you're happy with

261
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,920
and you're going to these data vendors.

262
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,640
So, what's next?

263
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,200
Did you just give up?

264
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,480
Do you pivot?

265
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,840
Where do you go from there?

266
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,040
We got mad.

267
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,200
Which was a good place to be.

268
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,680
And sometimes, that can be the best start

269
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,920
of something even better.

270
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
We got really, really angry,

271
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,160
about all the time we had spent.

272
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:29,720
And so, the analogy

273
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
that I use to describe

274
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,040
this point in the journey is that

275
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,960
we realized,

276
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,560
do we want to be in the car business

277
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,560
or do we want to be in the gas business.

278
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,880
Because that's a big choice to make.

279
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:40,000
We've recognized here,

280
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,320
anybody that wants to build a car

281
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,280
or a FinTech app or some type of solution

282
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,560
for financial services,

283
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,520
they're going to need fuel.

284
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,680
It's going to be data.

285
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,760
But if it's that expensive

286
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,480
and that restrictive for us

287
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,760
to get our hands on it,

288
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,600
maybe we've uncovered

289
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,360
a much bigger problem here.

290
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,720
An opportunity to kind of reinvent

291
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
the supply chain of how those data feeds

292
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,600
are made available.

293
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,640
And so, there was kind of

294
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,520
two things that happened.

295
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,160
We realized,

296
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,440
maybe we should think about data

297
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,560
as a business instead.

298
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,760
Because we literally can't move forward

299
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,960
unless we solve this problem.

300
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,640
And then the second piece

301
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,320
that came together for us was the thesis

302
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,840
that is definitely becoming true,

303
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,120
true or untrue every single year

304
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,360
that we're on this journey,

305
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,720
that the future of financial services

306
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,600
is very technical.

307
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,800
Engineers are flooding Wall Street.

308
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,680
Every bank is hiring

309
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,560
a 19 year old data scientist right now.

310
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,920
Every hedge funds becoming a quant fund.

311
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,360
And that technical transformation

312
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,800
of the industry is huge.

313
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,680
But these data providers

314
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,760
aren't prepared for it, right?

315
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,000
If you want to consume financial data,

316
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,280
most of these large data vendors

317
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
don't even have STKs.

318
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,680
They don't have software

319
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,520
development kits for you.

320
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,280
They have horrible documentation.

321
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,000
Their developer tools are awful.

322
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,800
But we knew that there were

323
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,160
engineers and innovators out there

324
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,320
that had ideas just like us

325
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,360
for an app or a tool

326
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,000
that could bring the industry forward.

327
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,760
If we could find a way to make data

328
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,880
more accessible to them

329
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,640
with the tools they needed,

330
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,600
we could serve that developer market

331
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,000
really, really well,

332
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,520
right at a time where it was about to,

333
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,400
we thought explode,

334
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,720
within financial services.

335
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,440
And that's exactly what happened.

336
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,880
And so, when are we in the timeline

337
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,120
of in terms of years?

338
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,160
What are we talking about now?

339
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,240
So, 2012 and '13, we were building

340
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,280
the engine that we had to kill.

341
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,080
And in 2013 was when we realized

342
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,960
we couldn't afford the data.

343
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,920
2014 was the year that we

344
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,400
really started thinking about data

345
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,880
as a business and doing research

346
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,040
and figuring out how we could start

347
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,080
building our own data feeds.

348
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,600
So, 2014 and 2015,

349
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
we were programming a lot,

350
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,880
we were building our technology,

351
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,240
we were getting

352
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,760
our first couple of data feeds built.

353
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,280
And then, it wasn't until 2016

354
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,040
that we really launched publicly.

355
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,560
So, all this time, 2014, 2015,

356
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,360
you still work,

357
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,400
you're still the coder,

358
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,000
you're still the developer,

359
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,400
iterating through understanding.

360
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,200
Okay, now let's pivot

361
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,320
and go into a new business.

362
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,560
Wow, that's pretty cool.

363
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,360
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

364
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,080
That's very, very cool.

365
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,040
So, my next question was going to be,

366
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,240
then, now you're in 2016,

367
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,040
what have you learned

368
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,480
over those four years

369
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,720
overall about the financial

370
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,480
technology services world?

371
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,680
So, you mentioned the analogy

372
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,360
to the cars and the fuels.

373
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,760
And you can either be building the engine

374
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,440
or you can be building

375
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,880
the data that's fueling it.

376
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,040
But for somebody that's not coming

377
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,120
from the FinTech space,

378
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,480
what are some great insights

379
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,160
that you have from there?

380
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,640
Yeah.

381
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:22,560
So, some things that we've learned

382
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,040
is that you would be wildly surprised

383
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,280
how far behind this industry is,

384
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,640
technologically.

385
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,760
The for example,

386
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,840
Bloomberg is kind of the household name.

387
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,960
Even if you're not in finance,

388
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,520
you probably know

389
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,800
what a Bloomberg terminal is.

390
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,880
You've heard of the company Bloomberg.

391
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,200
That terminal is built on

392
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,280
14 million lines of Fortran.

393
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,840
Fortran,

394
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,880
which is a programming language

395
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,800
of the oil industry,

396
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,400
stopped using 15 years ago.

397
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,120
But this critical piece of infrastructure

398
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,440
that's used by

399
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,040
hundreds of thousands of traders

400
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,760
all over the world

401
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,080
is built on Fortran, right?

402
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,680
I mean that's just an example of

403
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,200
how these big, big companies

404
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,520
can't move quickly,

405
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,600
even if they wanted to compete

406
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,440
with a company like us.

407
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,320
It's the classic innovator's dilemma.

408
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,640
And it's not even just in the data space.

409
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,120
I mean, you can apply that to lending,

410
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,320
you can apply that to consumer banking,

411
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,680
to  credit cards, to insurance,

412
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,600
to any FinTech vertical.

413
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,320
It's the same thing.

414
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,400
They all have their example

415
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,760
of the Bloomberg Fortran issue.

416
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,360
And its this legacy infrastructure,

417
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,520
where the FinTech are coming in

418
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,240
and trying to break that apart

419
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,640
and modernize it.

420
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,720
But it's not an easy task because

421
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,840
you're also talking about an industry

422
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,320
where you've got a bunch of people

423
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,760
who are really stuck in their ways.

424
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,040
And so convincing them to use

425
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,080
new technologies is not easy.

426
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,360
Right. And obviously,

427
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,520
it's not feasible to convert

428
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,320
14 million lines of code of Fortran

429
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
to the equivalent of today's

430
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
Python and JavaScript or Ruby.

431
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,280
That's a challenge on its own.

432
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,960
So, how do you go about doing that?

433
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,440
So, you're in 2016,

434
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,960
you're starting to create

435
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,640
these data streams yourself.

436
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,200
And then, we'll end by fast forwarding

437
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,080
to 2020, where now

438
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,720
you're allowing developers actually

439
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,000
to play with this data.

440
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,960
But what does that process look like?

441
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,480
So, I'll tell you a story

442
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,880
about the first data feed that we built

443
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,960
because it'll help you understand

444
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,880
how we approach

445
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,280
building our data products.

446
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,800
One of the core values

447
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,600
that's true to our company

448
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,720
is automation, right.

449
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,520
Where like, we'll never use humans

450
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,280
to do any of this.

451
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,920
Like there has to be

452
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,320
a way to automate it.

453
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,120
And by having that foundation,

454
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,080
it means we can spend more resources

455
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,440
towards making great tools

456
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,600
and we can keep the prices down

457
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,880
and make it accessible.

458
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,680
The more we automate,

459
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,440
the less money we have to spend on that,

460
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,400
the more money we can divert

461
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,240
in other ways.

462
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,720
So, the first dataset

463
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,760
that we ever looked at building

464
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,840
was just financial statement data.

465
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,640
And so, you take

466
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,080
there's all these 10K reports

467
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,120
that are filed at the SEC,

468
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,280
but no two companies

469
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,400
file their financial statements

470
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,280
the same way.

471
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,640
So, if you just went to the SEC

472
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,480
and tried to pull that data down,

473
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,200
Oracle might be reporting

474
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,440
cloud computing revenues,

475
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,320
hardware revenues,

476
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,760
software revenues.

477
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,120
The accountants over at Apple

478
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,600
just put revenues.

479
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,840
So, there is no way to actually compare

480
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,400
apples to apples between companies,

481
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,280
or even over time periods

482
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,960
because companies

483
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,160
change their lines of business.

484
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,280
And so, there's this massive data,

485
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
it's in a language called XBRL,

486
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,440
which is an offshoot of XML.

487
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,920
And it's this really nerdy

488
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,280
accounting programming language

489
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,400
that not too many people know about,

490
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,800
but we're experts in it.

491
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,480
Because we said,

492
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,360
wow, there's got to be a way

493
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,560
to use machine learning to clean that.

494
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,920
And so, what the large companies

495
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,720
like Bloomberg do is

496
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,680
they have 10,000 people overseas

497
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,360
that are manually normalizing

498
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,480
all of that data.

499
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,080
We took, my co-founder, who was a CPA,

500
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,960
between the two of us,

501
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,520
both had engineering skills,

502
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,320
and programmed that CPA knowledge

503
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,480
into an engine

504
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,960
that learns from itself over time,

505
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,000
get smarter,

506
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,920
and we take an algorithmic approach

507
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,080
to cleaning all that data.

508
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,360
So, with the two of us,

509
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,040
our data feed number one,

510
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,640
with the two of us,

511
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,520
we were able to build that

512
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,800
equity financial statement data feed

513
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,560
with two people in an algorithm.

514
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,520
And to this day,

515
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,400
it's still the highest selling dataset

516
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,000
on our entire platform.

517
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,080
And so, that's been our approach, right?

518
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,360
Where is the actual

519
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,480
root source of this data?

520
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,960
A lot of it at the SECs,

521
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,400
and then the stock exchanges,

522
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,800
different places like that.

523
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,960
Can we go straight to the roots,

524
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,600
can we clean it and pipe it through

525
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,680
in a much more efficient way,

526
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,600
as automated as we can,

527
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,000
and build great developer

528
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,080
tools around it.

529
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,840
And so, that's what we.

530
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,040
So, what does that mean

531
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,440
to build a great developer tools

532
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,040
around this data?

533
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,960
So, give me some ideas of

534
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,160
where somebody like myself

535
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,120
or any young entrepreneur

536
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,600
who could be using this data

537
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
to create some meaningful products.

538
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:26,840
Yeah.

539
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,000
So, we've got a sandbox environment.

540
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,960
We can get you API

541
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,280
keys within 30 seconds,

542
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,480
which is pretty unprecedented.

543
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,240
If you go talk to any

544
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,560
of the large vendors

545
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,280
they're not going to be that fast.

546
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,880
So, we'll get your API keys,

547
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,240
we'll get your sandbox access.

548
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,200
You can use software development kits

549
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,920
in over six different major languages.

550
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,000
We've got test environments.

551
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,920
We've got Jupiter notebooks

552
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,800
that you can pop open

553
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,520
and start playing around

554
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,960
with the data widgets

555
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,840
that you can test out

556
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,680
with just tons of tools.

557
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,560
Chat support seven days a week.

558
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,960
We just make it easy.

559
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,520
And I think a huge,

560
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,160
huge reason for our success is that

561
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,040
our company was built

562
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,680
by developers for developers .

563
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,040
So, we actually understand.

564
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,360
We were trying to build our own app.

565
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:03,560
Right?

566
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,720
We know exactly what it takes

567
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,000
to get it off the ground.

568
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,840
And what's interesting is,

569
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,960
a lot of these large vendors

570
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,040
that we compete against

571
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,080
have a major conflict of interest.

572
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,720
They're terrified of people like you

573
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,920
and me because they know

574
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,880
we could build a better app than them.

575
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,480
And so, if they open up those APIs

576
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,400
and those raw data streams,

577
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,520
might somebody maybe build

578
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,200
a better Bloomberg terminal?

579
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,240
So, what they do is

580
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,840
they slap these restrictions on.

581
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840
That's why we got quoted

582
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,720
as much as we did.

583
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,920
Any time an engineer comes to them

584
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,880
and says, "I want a raw API data feed."

585
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,120
They're not in a position to do it

586
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,680
because it could cannibalize

587
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,920
a whole part of their revenue stream.

588
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,480
So, we've taken the stance of saying,

589
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,360
we want you to build

590
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,640
something cool with this data.

591
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,360
We're never going to be

592
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,080
in the analytics or app building space.

593
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,320
We're just the plumbers.

594
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,720
And our goal is to get the data

595
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,880
Into the hands of these innovators

596
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,840
as fast as we can

597
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,160
so they can build awesome stuff with it.

598
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,200
That makes perfect sense.

599
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,120
But I have to ask,

600
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,720
so you're eight years into this journey,

601
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,200
coming from a very different background

602
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,160
than a tech background,

603
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,080
why stick to financial services?

604
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,880
What is it about this industry

605
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,600
that take you in some way that you say,

606
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,000
okay, I'm going to solve this

607
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,920
no matter what,

608
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,520
even if it's going to take four years

609
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,800
of bootstrapping and writing code myself?

610
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,240
You know, there's,

611
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,400
there's kind of two answers to that.

612
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,040
The first is,

613
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,320
just what I went through, right?

614
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,440
A year of my life.

615
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,360
I'm angry, right?

616
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,400
And then, I'm like there has to be

617
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,440
a better way to fix this

618
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,160
if I want to solve this problem

619
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,000
for other people.

620
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,200
And I'm pissed off

621
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,800
that I learned the hard way.

622
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,480
Hopefully for everybody else,

623
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,080
they don't have to learn that way.

624
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,680
So, that personal attachment

625
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,480
to just that time that I spending,

626
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,080
don't get me wrong,

627
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,880
there's lessons there.

628
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,480
I'm glad I went through that experience.

629
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,680
But

630
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,480
it shouldn't have had to be that way.

631
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,240
Those resources should

632
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,560
have been available to me.

633
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,680
And so, there's that personal story

634
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,920
of what I went through.

635
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,520
And then also, just the pure excitement

636
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,360
of watching our data come alive

637
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,480
inside of some really cool stuff.

638
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,440
I mean, our clients are building

639
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,080
chat bots, AI investing platforms.

640
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,840
They're building

641
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,640
their own trading terminals

642
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,880
risk analytics software,

643
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,720
mobile apps for investing,

644
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,440
some hedge funds.

645
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,120
We can't even see what they're doing,

646
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,080
they just do some deep learning models.

647
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,320
There's awesome stuff.

648
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,240
And we get to be the fuel behind of that.

649
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,040
And so, we just get to see

650
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,960
the little phrase, powered by Internio,

651
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,880
at the bottom of this

652
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,160
next generation of apps.

653
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,560
And so, we get to feel like

654
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,680
we're a driving force

655
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,840
behind changing an industry

656
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:22,240
that's really far behind technologically.

657
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,040
So, it's fun.

658
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,040
So, you are the fuel.

659
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,800
So you are the fuel to this whole new

660
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,240
21st century generation of tools

661
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,560
that allow others to build apps

662
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,720
based on this data, right?

663
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,840
So, anybody who wants to build a chatbot,

664
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,760
or an any AI machine that allows me

665
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,360
to invest better or get more information,

666
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,720
you're supplying that information.

667
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,320
Because otherwise,

668
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,560
it would be very restrictive

669
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,840
through the Bloomberg terminal

670
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,120
or the likes of the giants, right?

671
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,800
That's the basic premise here.

672
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,480
Exactly.

673
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,320
You nailed it.

674
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,600
Welcome to the sales team.

675
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,520
You're hired.

676
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,840
Very, very cool.

677
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,440
So, now it's 2020.

678
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,920
One of the things that we mentioned

679
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,880
right before starting this is that

680
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,400
you are now getting this out there

681
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,760
to as many developers as possible.

682
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,200
You've partnered with Stanford

683
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,000
to provide Stanford students

684
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,600
with the data to play around with, right?

685
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,400
And that's something

686
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,720
that I'm excited to look at myself.

687
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
But what is sort of

688
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,560
the vision for this in the long run

689
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,800
besides just licensing the data?

690
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,960
Yeah, we want to be the

691
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,680
number one go-to data provider

692
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,840
for anybody doing something innovative

693
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,200
in financial services.

694
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,640
Sometimes that is big companies, right?

695
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,920
We have some huge hedge funds

696
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,480
and institutions that have projects

697
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,720
or tools they're building.

698
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,120
But it's more fun when we're selling

699
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,040
to the guys in the couch

700
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,920
that are building something cool.

701
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,920
So, we're expanding constantly

702
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,280
the types of data that we provide

703
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,760
in multiple different directions, right?

704
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,080
So, we're going deeper, which means

705
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,120
what else at the SEC can we extract?

706
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,600
Can we extract risk factors?

707
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,880
Can we go get different types of data?

708
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
How can we go deeper here

709
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,760
in the United States

710
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,760
to deliver more US based data feeds?

711
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,240
And then there's broad, right?

712
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,760
Which is,

713
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,880
can we go to different countries?

714
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,880
These financial filings

715
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,840
are everywhere in the world.

716
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,080
Most of them are digitized

717
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,360
and structured and publicly available.

718
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,280
So, where can we take

719
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,160
this tech that we built,

720
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,880
apply it and have a global set

721
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,680
of fundamentals

722
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,240
and another types of data?

723
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,440
We have global pricing data.

724
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,240
But the fundamentals

725
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,720
in the financial statements is

726
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,360
something we'd like to expand on.

727
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,240
So, we're going deeper

728
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,160
in the United States

729
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,600
with different types of US data.

730
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,520
We're going broader

731
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,560
internationally with data.

732
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,560
And then we're also starting to branch

733
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,240
a little bit outside of the quantitative

734
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,560
into the qualitative.

735
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,920
So, obviously there's been a lot

736
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,800
of advancements

737
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,880
in natural language processing

738
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,960
over the past two years.

739
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,400
GPT-3 coming out.

740
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,200
We have a lot of demand

741
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,800
from our customers

742
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,560
who say, "You're giving us

743
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,920
all these great data points

744
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,080
that are quantitative.

745
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,240
But could you give us some

746
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,160
qualitative information?"

747
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,040
"Could you help us search

748
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,800
through the filings

749
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,400
and get other information that way?"

750
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,320
And so, that's kind of where

751
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,000
our R&D efforts are focused right now,

752
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,240
is how can we start to reimagine.

753
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,080
Maybe we don't just have

754
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,320
to be a quantitative data provider,

755
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,920
maybe we start delivering

756
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,520
some intelligence to our clients

757
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,760
that is qualitative as well.

758
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,120
So, those are some of the areas

759
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,880
that we're exploring

760
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,200
and where we're headed next.

761
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,560
That's very, very cool.

762
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,520
So, if you could go back now to 2012

763
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,080
and talk to Rachel back then,

764
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,440
who still bootstrapping

765
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
through that first iteration

766
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,560
of building this engine,

767
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,920
what are some high level things

768
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,040
that you would tell her

769
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,560
from the experiences that you've gained

770
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,440
over the last eight years?

771
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,320
You know, that's a tough one.

772
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,840
Because I could write a book

773
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,080
about the mistakes that I've made.

774
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,040
I'm keeping track of them.

775
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,520
And I might do that one day.

776
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,600
But I learned from all of them, you know.

777
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,040
I'm happy that we took the path,

778
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,560
and we did it.

779
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,600
It took those early pivots for us.

780
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:31,440
It took us solving a bad problem

781
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,280
to find a better problem to solve.

782
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,760
So, I wouldn't change anything.

783
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,440
But I think, just to give myself

784
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
a little reassurance,

785
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,800
to say, I always use the phrase:

786
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,240
the roller coaster goes back up again.

787
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,440
There are so many times

788
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,000
when the roller coaster goes down.

789
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,760
And it can feel like

790
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,360
it's time to quit, pack up the bags,

791
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,800
go get a nice job, have health insurance,

792
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,120
different things like that.

793
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,320
And it can be easy to get down

794
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,520
when the roller coaster goes down.

795
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,400
But it always goes back up again.

796
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,520
So, that'll be something

797
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,600
I would reassure myself about.

798
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,080
Because there are definitely

799
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,040
some challenging times early on.

800
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,360
I love that.

801
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,680
You know, 20 minutes go by so fast.

802
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,480
But it's so inspiring for me

803
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,240
to always hear about these journeys.

804
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,800
Especially the eight year journey.

805
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,040
That's incredible.

806
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,600
A lot of investors,

807
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,720
when they look at a pre-seed

808
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,920
or a seed company,

809
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,640
they look at the founders

810
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,680
and they ask themselves, you know,

811
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,360
"Is this a founding team

812
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,720
that I am able to see them

813
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,400
going through an eight year journey

814
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,280
of roller coasters?"

815
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,200
And you know,

816
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,520
that's a very hard question

817
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,560
to answer a lot of the time.

818
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,960
Especially in today's generation,

819
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,720
we keep changing our mind

820
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,320
and moving from one place to another.

821
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,360
So, I think I'm getting

822
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,440
a lot of inspiration from that.

823
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,280
So, Rachel, thank you for sharing

824
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,960
the story with me

825
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,920
and with everybody that's listening here.

826
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,400
And I really appreciate you coming on.

827
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,720
Before we finish,

828
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,320
I have to ask you

829
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,760
the most important question,

830
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,760
three words that you would use

831
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,560
to describe yourself.

832
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,360
Definitely, feisty.

833
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,040
I get told I'm feisty a lot.

834
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm definitely fast.

835
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,200
So, I'd say feisty and fast.

836
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,640
And probably, loud.

837
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,800
I am loud a lot, too.

838
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,960
Kind of like a steam engine.

839
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,840
Feisty, fast and loud. I love it,

840
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,000
Rachel, thank you so much.

841
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,920
This is really, really great.

842
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,320
Best of luck with Intrinio.

843
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,200
I look forward to trying

844
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,720
and playing around with it myself

845
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,240
and spreading it

846
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,880
with the Stanford community.

847
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,480
But it sounds like

848
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,560
you're doing a great service

849
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,640
to the FinTech sector.

850
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,200
I am very excited to see where it goes.

851
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,160
Thank you so much for having me.
