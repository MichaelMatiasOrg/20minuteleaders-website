1 Dr. Elia Gourgouris, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Thank you for having me. I appreciate it. It’s good to be here. It’s going to be so much fun. I’m going to spend the next 20 minutes learning how to be happier and how to navigate through crisis better because these are the two books that you’ve written. The first one, a best-selling book; the second one, I’m guessing, is already on its way to becoming a best-selling book. - It's out in the market. - I hope so. It just came out. So, I hope so. - It's just looking good. - You have it next to you. So, let me see the cover. Let me see how it looks. The new book is “7 Keys to Navigating a Crisis,” a practical guide to mostly dealing with pandemics and other disasters. We’re going through a multitude of crises at the same time right now. - WIth four, right? - So, this is really morbid. Yes. Yes. Okay. We’re going to get there in a second. But first, I need to know how to be happier and I’m very excited for this. So, maybe just give me a couple of the key earned insights. Over your decades of research, what is happiness and why do we yearn for it so much, this concept? First of all, happiness is a choice. Let’s make it -- And it takes work, however. It comes easier for some than others. But I will tell you this. I get to speak internationally. I travel around the world speaking on happiness and wellness. In every country, the first question I ask the audience is this -- if you were to ask any parent, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, religious affiliation, socio-economic status, gender, whatever, "What would you like for your children?" And the answer is always, “I just want them to be --" and then I take the microphone and I point towards the audience, “Happy!” you know, everybody's -- because that’s a universal need, right? We are here on this earth to be happy. So, the easiest way, of course, is -- you cannot be grateful and be sad at the same time. So, to have an attitude of gratitude -- and that’s pretty well-known. What I want to raise the bar a little bit -- because it’s easy to be grateful when everything is going well. That’s the easiest thing in the world. I say that we’re all graduates from the same university, the university of adversity. And the older we get, and the more experience we have, the higher the degree. So, by the time you get to be my age, you have gray hair, you have multiple PhDs and adversity in life. Meaning, that we’re all going to lose people we love -- our grandparents first, and then our parents, at some point, maybe a spouse or a sibling, God forbid, a child. We’re going to have financial crisis. We’re going to have health crisis, be it cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and so on. We’re going to have relationships, divorces. Things aren’t going to work out. So, all of these things are part of the human existence, right? So, the key, of course, now, is can you be grateful in the midst of crisis? Can you be grateful when you’re facing adversity in life? Because when things are going well, like I said, it’s easy to be happy and to be grateful. But can we be grateful in the midst of the darkness of life? I’m going to ask you that. What do you think? Is that possible even? It has to be, otherwise, this is going to be a very sad conversation. So, I’m going to say that it has to be. It has to be, yes. And the key, of course, to that is, to me, nothing bad has ever happened in my own personal life and the thousands of patients -- I used to be a clinical psychologist, my first ever practice in my life before I switched over to the corporate side. Everybody faces these things. Some of them, multiple times, and sometimes, at the same time, which is very difficult. But to me, either you’re learning something or you’re winning. There’s no losing in life -- Right. -- if you learned the lesson. So, out of the toughest, the most -- the darkest of times, I’ve actually learned more than my successes. Right. And then, you use those to move forward, right? In life. - So... - Sure. ...don’t be afraid of adversity because adversity is coming. And we’re getting it now in spades, actually, in humanity as we speak right now. And I do want to go to that. We got multiple crises. We got the COVID-19. We have the financial crisis and economic crisis as the result of the shutdown. We have a mental health crisis. Just in the United States alone, after the first two months -- we don’t have the statistics yet, from the month of May yet. Depression, anxiety, stress-related disorders, up an astonishing 700%. Seven hundred percent. Seven hundred percent. These are new people. Not people that have pre-existing conditions, mind you. These are specifically as a result of the pandemic. And then, of course, you have the racial strife and everything that’s happening in the streets right now as we speak. So, to have four crises simultaneously is very unusual. Now, I’m an optimist by nature and I will tell you this, that humanity may be down on one knee and maybe struggling a little bit. And we’re getting a beating right now. But we will overcome this. Let there be no doubt. And I also want to share with you that there are four types -- four personality types when dealing with crisis. And there’s a big differentiation between danger and fear. If somebody comes up to you and cuss in your face right now, you’re in danger. That’s real. Fear, however, is not your friend. So, we don’t want to make decisions, whether as individuals or as companies, whether in the corporate world or any organization based on fear because those are not good decisions. - Right. - So now, let’s talk about the four personality types. Number one is the victim. The victim is all, “Why is this happening to me? "This always happens to me." "Poor me,” right? "Poor me." The second personality type is what we call the critic. Now the critic, regardless of what the federal state or local government, or the health care officials that -- they criticize everything. For example, “You should wear a mask when you go outside.” “Well, that’s stupid.” Okay. “Okay, don’t wear a mask when you go outside.” “Well, that’s stupid, too.” Like, no matter what comes up, they criticize everything, right? It's like no matter -- It doesn’t matter what it is. The third group, we’d like to call the bystander. They make the most noise, right? They do and they’re very loud. They’re very loud. But they offer no solutions. This is important. The third group, we'd call the bystander. Now, the bystander is a good person. But basically, the bystander is overwhelmed by -- and really doesn’t know what to do. Like, “This is a huge wave of unknown. I feel out of control. My life is out of control. I don’t know what to do.” So, they look to their left. They look to their right. They look at their neighbor. But they sit in their -- they have that deer with the headlights look, and they do nothing. And all three of these personality types have one thing in common. They offer no solution. Right. The victim doesn’t, the critics surely doesn’t, and neither does the bystander. Now we get to the fourth type. And the fourth type, we’d like to call the navigator. And the navigator -- and this is the premise of this book, right? That we all should become navigators. The navigator begins with a positive attitude, and says, “Look. No matter what happens, we will overcome this,” practices self-care, which is the first key to navigating a crisis. Meaning, They take care of themselves in order to be successful. And then, they are flexible and adaptable. With this new normal, if you think you can go on and do business as usual and expect to have successful results, you’re sadly mistaken. Right. Right. Everything’s completely different right now in the last 90 days to four months. And why is flexibility important? We’d like to use the example of the oak tree and the palm tree. The oak tree symbolically speaking -- think about this. The oak tree is this massive, strong tree that’s been around for 100 years. - Huge, strong, right? - Very stable. Yup. But if there’s enough moisture, enough rain and enough wind at the top of the storm, the hurricane, guess what happens to oak trees. They come crashing down, - on cars, people, homes, and so on. - Yeah. The palm tree, on the other hand, is thin, tall but very flexible. At the top of the hurricane 150 miles, yes, it goes of wide -- it’ll go parallel to the ground. But when the storm passes -- and think about the storm of life, - right? Not actual storm -- - Yeah. -- it raises up again and survives. Up and down, yeah. Up and down. So, we’re asking people now to be flexible like a palm tree. Don't be an oak tree and say, “Well, that’s how I’ve done things for the last 30 years. I’m not changing,” you’re going to break if you stay like that. You need to be flexible. But Dr. Gourgouris, I have to ask. Because you also have a lot of experience working with corporates. And you transitioned from clinical work to the private sector. And now, you’re helping leaders -- and I’m going to take myself for example. One day, I’m going to have a company of my own. And I hope to have a thousand employees, which I can lead that ship wherever we go. Now, the question is, is it really reasonable to try and aim for all of the employees in the organization to be navigators? Or do you want to have some critics, some bystanders? Or do you really want everybody to be navigators here? This is a fantastic question and here’s why. The critic, the victim, the bystander. and the navigator all exist within every human being. We all have those personalities within us, right? Yeah. And I'll tell you, when this first hit, I was the bystander. All my speaking engagements that I had set up throughout the world, guess what happened? Cancelled. - Yeah. - All gone. I’m like, “Now what do I do,” right? And I kind of feel like a victim a little bit. I’m like, “Oh, no! Why is this happening to me?” And believe me, there are things that the government has done that I criticized very openly. I’m like, “That is stupid.” Look, I see people driving in their cars, sometimes, by themselves wearing a mask. Hello! There’s nobody else in the car. And here is the important thing, I didn’t stay a victim. I didn't stay in critical mode. And I didn’t stay as a bystander. I decided to do something about it. And the result of actually that of the navigating is writing a brand-new book. I had no plans in 2020 to write a book. Beautiful. I had this impression that I needed to do it and I called my partner. I’m like -- he’s Greek also. I’m like, “Costa, do you want to write a book? I'm going to write this book. Are you in or are you out, brother?” - He goes, “I’m in.” -  I love it. And in 45 days, we got the book out. Wow! To put that in perspective, my first book took three years to write. Okay. That’s incredible. That’s what navigation looks like. So, do we want all our employees to be navigators? You’re darn right, we do. No, I think that’s incredible. Specifically -- just yesterday, I spoke with a professor, Dan Ariely, who’s a good friend and a mentor, behavioral economics. He wrote “Predictably Irrational." And he said that one of the things -- His advice to us was that when he has a plane that is delayed, he sits down and uses that opportunity to write a children’s book. And he only writes the children’s book when his flight is delayed. So, he’s turning that situation form a victim point, “Why is this happening to me,” to “Oh! I have an opportunity to now work on a project that I never had a chance.” So, I’m seeing all these patterns of the very successful people and I’m starting to adopt this mindset. So, we want everybody to be navigators, but also -- more importantly because of the other book, too, we want them to be happy navigators. We don’t want you to just navigate and -- - be grumpy about it. - What does that mean? What does that mean, being a happy navigator? To me, it means that you enjoy the process. You truly enjoy the journey. When we talk in the corporate world -- I started talking about happiness in the corporate world before all the studies backed it up, right? Because they used to be like, “Happy employees? I pay them. What do they need to be happy for?” [laughs] I’ll tell you why they need to be happy. Because happy employees, number one, they're physically healthier. That means they have less time off because they’re healthier. Okay. They’re more collaborative. They’re better team players because they’re happier. There’s greater retention, right? People don’t leave. They’re loyal. They love where they work. And as a result to that, they’re more productive. Right. Guess what happens when you have a productive workforce. Your company is more profitable. Well, what’s happening now in Silicon Valley? Every other day, we see of another allegation or accusation of companies’ cultures. They’re just going down. And it seems that company culture in 2020 is one of the most important aspects that a founder has to work on. So, where do you come into this arena? What's happening? And why are companies suffering from their lack of happiness or culture? Because their focus should be where? When you treat your employees poorly, guess how your employers treat your customers. Poorly. When you treat your employees well, guess how they treat your customers. They treat your customers well. There’s a direct link between the way that you treat people. So, in the rush -- especially, nowadays, with the economy being shut down for 60 to 90 days, HR directors right now are having a very difficult time - Yup. - because the CEO -- now, they’re ramping up again, economy -- businesses are coming back on again, right? Now they’re like, “Listen. Our revenue, we’re behind schedule by 60 to 90 days, what are goals were for this year.” The employees need to work two times or three times as hard as they did before. That’s where their CEO is coming from. Now, the employees, on the other hand, who are coming back -- and not all of them because some of them are going to stay at home. They’re going to refuse to come to work. They’ve been traumatized by all this. So many things have happened out of their control. So, the seniors -- I call it the C-suite, basically. Senior leaders need to treat employees completely different than before. And they need to say, “Look, I know we have to hit those numbers by the end of this month. But here’s the why behind it.” Like, they need to step up their own game and communicate to the employees as to, "Why I’m asking you to hit those numbers? Because if we don’t, I may have to lay off 25% of the workforce. And I don’t want to do that." The enlightened leader will use those words, and say, “You’re part of my family. I don’t want to have to let go of any one of you. I need you to work harder so we can hit those numbers, so everybody is still employed next month." And not to do it in a fear-based mode, where you do it, “Or else --” but truly do it in an empathetic, caring and compassionate mode, so say, “Listen, we’re all in this together. We’re all struggling. None of us expected to have almost zero revenue for 90 days. So, we’re way behind the 8th ball. I do need your help. I do need you to work 14 hours, but I’m doing this because I also want you to be here at the end of the year so we can all be standing together and united.” If they don’t do that and they just focus on the bottom line -- these people are already scared. They’re already down. They’re already depressed and traumatized. You had that kind of pressure on top of that, you’re not going to hit your goals. So, it’s sounds like if I thought that until now as the real test of leadership, it sounds like, actually, the re-opening is going to be just as great a test on how do you now treat -- how do you understand and empathize with the new situation and your "new employees" that -- it’s not just like you froze for 90 days and you came back to reality. But reality continued. It diverted. And now, you have a new reality to work with. And you used two key words. Empathy, meaning -- in other words, senior leaders need to show increased emotional intelligence, like they need a lot more than they ever have before. That’s number one. And then number two, in some ways, you’re re-onboarding all your employees, like as if they’re new because this is a new -- truly, it’s a new normal. And people say, “Oh, I hate to use that term.” But guess what? The new normal will become the new normal because these are changing so rapidly, we really don’t know even what the fall will bring. Yeah. Nobody can really predict. Will there be a second wave? How bad will it be? Will it happen in September and November when the flu season kicks in? People don’t really know. So, this is the reason why it’s important to take care of your employees now, more than ever. Dr. Gourgouris, why are you so passionate about this? Why go get a PhD on Psychology and focus on happiness, write two books? You’re the president of an organization that helps thousands of people be happier. Why? Why? Because I feel like my purpose in life -- and I’ve known this since I was young man, actually, is to make a difference in this world. And I feel this world right now is really struggling. I need to up my own game. Like writing this book in 45 days. I had to up my own game and my own expectations. Because normally, I’m like -- I’m not going to greet like, “Oh, whatever. We’ll get there when we get there.” No, there’s an urgency to do things right and to do them now, because people are hurting and they’re struggling now, not next November, not in 2021 or 2025. We need to help them now. And organizations need that help now. This comes from an optimist. by the way. I’m not like the-sky-is-falling pessimistic guy, but I see what’s out there. And I feel. I feel deeply. So, for me, yes, happiness is the most important thing in life. Senior leaders need to have a different mindset going into this. It’s not business as usual. Your workforce is not the same that it was 90 days ago. I promise you. So many things have changed. So, be sensitive to that. The words that you also used---- compassion, kindness, understanding. Over-communicate to the point where your employees go, “Boss, enough! That’s the tenth time you told me that you care about me. I got it. I got to go to work now.” Like, I know it’s kind of silly what I’m saying, but you know what I mean though. - Like you have to overdo it. - Over-communicate, yeah. Yes, over-communicate and show them that you truly care -- That’s the downfall of a lot of leaders, right? That they under-communicate instead of over-communicate. In other words, we can't afford to take shortcuts as a leadership right now. Not this time. Not this time. I’m really excited for where you’re going with your life. I'll tell you. I did my research on you. You’re a wonderful young man. And I see nothing but success in front of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it. One of the reasons why I enjoy this so much, like we spoke before, it’s because I get to learn of all these different industries. And when else would I get to speak to a happiness expert and gain -- even if I take three takeaways from this on over-communication and having empathy for my colleagues and employees, and employers, and being a navigator instead of a critic or instead of a bystander. I mean just those three things are priceless lessons that I learned, and hopefully, my friends who are watching this will also enjoy. Doctor, before we leave -- and I can't believe 20 minutes are almost up, it's so disheartening. Going by fast. - Yeah, it goes fast. - So fast. I want to know three words that best describe you. Well, happiness is number one. I mean, my nickname is, "You’re the 'Happiness Doctor,'” basically. So, happiness is one. I think there’s nothing more important to me than family and the family unit, the people that I love the most. And then, my faith. Whether your faith is in God or your faith is in the divine, or your faith is whatever you want to describe that -- We will overcome this. Let there be no doubt. The vaccine will come. The drugs, we’re getting very close to having the drugs already. And I love the fact that humanity is working together. All the scientists from all over the world are working together. We have a common enemy, an invisible enemy. And listen, humanity has been up against the wall before. This is not going to be the end of us. We will be better as a result of it. I hope so. And even in the corporate world, I think that’ll be better. The working from home, or some of the differences that we're seeing right now, in new ways, there’ll be more innovation than we’ve seen in quite a while because that’s what crisis brings about, is the need for innovation. So, that’s another plus. So, don’t give up. I love it. Keep the faith. Be happy. I love it. Okay, last question just because it’s really fascinating me now. Where are we headed with the research on happiness? What is left to uncover? So, we know we want to be happy. We have an idea of things that -- of how to deal with adversity. But what is left to uncover on this big question of happiness? I think the one thing that all of the happiness, it has to do with kindness, because, yes, self-care is important. But it's -- in the end, why? Why are we doing all this? It’s to help one another. I want talk to your audience. If you’re feeling sorry for yourself, if you feel like, “Man, I have to sort out -- Things are really hard right now,” I promise you there’s somebody else out there whose life is a lot worse than yours. A hundred percent. Find that person and, in act of service. It could be a text. It could be a phone call. If you get that prompting, “I need to call Michael,” I’m not going to put it off. I’m going to call Michael, say, “How are you doing?” In America, here, the answer is always, “I’m doing fine.” And I’m going to say, “No, no, no. How are you really doing? It’s between you and I now.” This is what managers need to do with their employees. Yes. They need to ask the second question, not just a token, “How are you doing,” because most people are going to say, “Fine.” I’m like, “No, let me close the door. " "I see your countenance. I see your face." "I see your eyes. I think you’re struggling." "Tell me what I can do to help you.” I think this is the Greek part of you that’s coming out from the -- - Yeah. - Yeah? Yes. It is because we love -- There’s a work in Greek called “philoxenia," which means -- Philoxenia means "the love of strangers," in essence. So, we have to go the extra mile and help those around us. And there’s need all around. By the way, happy people are kind by nature. On the other hand, when you perform an act of kindness, that makes you happy on the inside. So, with kindness and happiness, you can’t have one without the other, in essence. Maybe there need to be more study about connection between those two, kindness and happiness. I love it. Dr. Gourgouris, thank you so much for your time, for the inspiration. I can’t wait to order your book and read it, “Navigating Crisis." I can’t believe you wrote it in 45 days. That must be [inaudible]  -- I had help. I had help. Of course. With all the help in the world, bringing an idea to production in 45 days, it’s mind-blowing. So, I can’t wait to read it. And thank you for taking the time to do this. Thanks for having me on your program. Thank you. Take care. You, too.
