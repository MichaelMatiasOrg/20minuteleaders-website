1 As we come out of this, our expectation is that there's going to be good real estate out there, unfortunately, because some restaurants aren't going to survive this. And the restaurants that we're able to weather the storm are going to be in a good position to grow. Chuck Imerson, thank you for joining me. Asian Box, I love it. Thank you. Oh, we love our raving fans. That's for sure. Chuck, thank you, first of all, for all the amazing work that you're doing with Asian Box. I've had a lot of people on this show so far. You're probably my favorite one, I have to say, because you brought so much happiness to me in my time in Palo Alto. And that when I return to Palo Alto, I'll continue having that great time. But you bring such happiness to so many different people across the chains of Asian box. That it's a really an honor to meet you. Because I think Asian Box is a different type of restaurant than a lot of others. And I'll let you expand on that. But, Chuck, before we get into that, talk to me a little bit about yourself. And how do you get to become the chief executive officer of a restaurant chain? Well, you know, I've been in the business since I got out of school. And I spent a lot of time with Marie Callender's restaurant, which is a well-known chain. And then I moved over to start ups. I actually did LYFE Kitchen, which was also in Palo Alto. And that meeting with the founders of Asian Box, and we had a good connection. And in 2014, I came over and joined the team to head of operations, and you know, with their work. And then over time, the founder moved on. And I have an opportunity to move up. And I got to take over just before covid entered our lives. So, it's been an exciting and challenging time for sure. Right. I actually bumped into you, I remember, in one of the Palo Alto restaurants. And I remember sitting there and somehow, I came to realize that the CEO of Asian Box is going to come. And I just thought to myself, "Oh, my God". You know, I've met a bunch of CEOs from the tech scene, but they're not nearly as exciting as the CEO of Asian Box, where I eat almost every single day. So, it was a very funny coincidence. Chuck, give me a little bit of insight into what Asian box is. And why is that a bit of a different restaurant than the average restaurant we would see on the street? Well, you know, we are Vietnamese street food. A couple of things I think may make us different is that we're 100% gluten free. You know, just naturally, about with the ingredients we use. So, anybody who's looking for that can feel comfortable and safe. Vietnamese food is your everyday food. And with our ingredients, we have top quality ingredients, which I think separates us from some of the competition. And the food travels well. We have good portions. We were founded on "build your own", which people really enjoy being having that flexibility of being able to you know, create their flavor profile that they want, the box that they want. In addition, now we've added about a dozen signature boxes as well, so, to make it easier for people that just want to come in and pick something with the chef together. Right. So, when you walk in, you get the workout, you get those types of things. But you can also create your own box. And I have to say that one of the things that really impressed me when I got introduced to Asian Box, I believe it was 2013, early 2014, I was just running a high school startup. And I remember we would always walk to Town & Country to eat at Asian Box. And I remember that, you know, that everything just seemed so natural. All the way from the plate to the utensils. The actual food seemed so fresh. How do you get that? How do you bring that feeling to the customer? Well, you know, you give a lot of credit to you know, the founders that put it together. Gracie Nguyen who is the chef, it's her family recipes. Chad and Frank or the other two founders, really put together everything from the compostable container to the sourcing, working locally where possible and you know, again, the freshest quality ingredients. And the good news is, you know, that particular location, that's our flagship store that I know you've been a regular for quite some time. And we feed Stanford, we feed the hospital, we feed the high school. And we've been very fortunate. We have a big following there in addition to the catering, which, again, with our food, the way it holds, the way it travels, we built up, well, prior to covid, built a strong catering business as well. So, I think all of that kind of comes together. You know, the biggest thing is, is the team, you know. The manager that we've had, the mangers we've had. The one now who's been in charge of that store, Wendy, for several years, it's all about she's the leader. She sets the pace, training the staff, developing the staff. And all of them are, you know, live around the community. They all are passionate about the food, what we're trying to do as far as the lifestyle and just taking care of customers, you know, with the smile. Right. You're giving a lot of autonomy and credibility to the restaurant manager, Wendy, from Town & Country. So, first of all, thank you, Wendy. But Chuck, you're the CEO of the chain. What is your responsibility then as the CEO once you have a really amazing people running the local businesses? Well, you know, I think, again, it starts with the people I mean, I've been fortunate, we have eight stores now. And we have eight great managers that care. That if I was going to start another company, I would happily bring any of them over. And to me, that's kind of the barometer that I want to use that these people all, to your point, they have autonomy, they feel a sense of ownership, they go that extra mile. All of our cashiers are empowered to take care of any issue. It's not know, you know, they all have a level of ownership. Or if there's a problem, we're going to take care of it. And it's not going to be through a process, it's just going to be right now. And, you know, getting those teams, building them and then helping them build their branches and keeping them focused on what's important. Right now, obviously, we can't stress safety enough with everything going on in the world. So, we spent a lot of time talking about that and what does that mean and what's the perception of the consumer, and being very ahead of what the guest expects. That makes a lot of sense. And how do you think more critically about what the guest expects? Because as the CEO, I'm imagining that you're setting the tone for the expectation across all the chains. Right? Aligning the vision, aligning the strategy that at the end, the great people that are working there, they should aspire to. So, how do you adjust to that role? And what are some of the thinking process that goes on behind that? Well, you know, it's kind of two part when it's the business of where are we going, you know, long term. Whether that's the marketing, whether that's new menu items, whether that's different promotions or whatever we're offering. But I think what's more important is keeping it very simple for the managers. It's you know, the restaurant business is really a lot of common sense and hospitality. And if everybody understands that we're here to make the guest happy, then that's our barometer to making our decisions. Then it simplifies it. And the guests want the food to come out fast, at a high quality, obviously fresh, and made properly. So, our procedures need to be in place and validated. We use where a third party service that comes in and acts as the health department, in addition to the health department and grades all the restaurants. And we have a culinary person who goes around and works with the culinary teams and teaching them new techniques or just keeping them on track. We do obviously, all the safety procedures you would expect any restaurant to do, temperature checks and all those throughout the day. But the biggest thing is, is the employees caring, you know. And if they care, they're going to take care of it. And if they look at it as, okay, I want the experience, I'm going to deliver the experience I want to have. And we talk about that, pre-shift meetings as far as you know, we want to go fast, but we don't want to rush. So, the boxes need to come out perfect every time. And being that it's customizable, there's a lot of different variations of modifiers, in addition to the fact that there's a lot of sensitivity. Some people are certainly, obviously gluten free, we don't to worry about because we're 100% gluten free. But we have peanuts and other allergens that are there. And educating our team to be able to give the guests what they want, consistently, is a big deal. And consistency is the biggest factor, I think. When I teach managers and teach the employees and from my leadership, consistency is that number one word. Because people can trust that. If you're consistent, we have a lot of regulars like yourself. I know we have a gentleman at Palo Alto that comes in, I think five days a week and get the workout. And obviously, he wants that workout and he wants it that way. Right. And we have other examples of that. And, you know, we're very transparent. I get a lot of feedback from the guests and I answer as many as I can. And they care too, you know. They understand that being gluten free and being a fast casual, especially right now, they're very supportive. That makes a lot of sense. So, give me a little bit of context as to how many restaurants are there. What is sort of the circulation of obviously just the parameters that you can share? Yeah, you know, we opened the first store in early 2012, and then we opened two more in the following couple of years, late 2012, actually, 2013. I came on in 2014. You know, we went through a period where we didn't grow. And then we opened seven stores pretty quickly in 2016 through 2018. And we peaked at four in Southern California and six in Northern California at ten. Unfortunately, when the pandemic hit, we made the tough decision to let two stores go in Southern California. And then we have another store in downtown LA that's temporarily closed in part because of the pandemic, but in part the landlord's remodeling the center. So, it was just coincidental timing. So, we have seven stores operating today. One in Irvine and six in Northern California. And we're throughout the peninsula from down from San Jose up to the Marina Chestnut store, Burlingame, Mountain view. And so, that's kind of where we're at today. We are raising money right now. We have a series-F open. We feel like this is the opportunity to grow right now, even though these are very challenging times. We've weathered the storm to date. And we feel like we're going to come out stronger. We've been forced like a lot of our peers, to make tough cuts, to really look at our business and so to speak, trim the fat, so to speak. Being very efficient with our labor cost, with our food cost. And looking at every expense from our POS system to everything you could imagine, insurances. And we feel like we've been very efficient at the necessity. We thought we were efficient. We spent a lot of 2019 really kind of becoming a more efficient company, a more profitable company, getting what we call our prime costs down, which is the term in combination of food and labor, a term in the restaurant industry. And we really got that down to where we could grow and potentially start franchising, but then covid hit. So, we looked even deeper and made some tough decisions. So, as we come out of this, our expectation is that there's going to be good real estate out there, unfortunately, because some restaurants are not going to survive this. And the restaurants that were able to weather the storm are going to be in a good position to grow. That's a very interesting way of looking at it. Yeah. And our thought process is that as we get into next year, right now, where we're as is we basically lost our catering business. And I know we're not alone in that. And that's 20% of our business. And that hopefully will come back when people feel comfortable going back into the offices and getting a comfort level. And that might not be till 2022 realistically. And we understand that. But our other business, our partners with people like DoorDash and Grab Hub and Uber Eats has helped us survive in addition to, you know, we partnered with SpotOn, which is an up and coming POS system. And they have the ability for online ordering and app, and all those things. So, we flex great into that. And it was kind of already in process, but we really flex hard into that to maximize the guests being able to order easily and comfortably, safely, whether they want the food delivered or pick up with non-contact. We have all that happening. And so, we built the trust back. And over time we built our business back up to where, really the only thing we're missing from last year is catering. And like I said, I expect that to come back eventually. So, in a way, even though we've gone through a very challenging situation, we're in a good position to grow. And our hope is to raise some capital and sign a couple of leases next year. I have to say that I'm really inspired by your take on the positioning that you're saying, we've entered this pandemic, we had to make some very tough decisions, we closed two restaurants, we've pretty much lost the catering business because there really is no catering in 2020 and likely 2021. Yet we realize that there are opportunities for those that are able to climb over the hill, even if they're wounded. But there are going to be opportunities to grow into a relatively emptier market, whether it's in real estate or whether it's in customer acquisition. And I'm sure that you're thinking about that. But I have to say that, as a young entrepreneur and not coming from the restaurant scene, I really love that entrepreneurial way of thinking of going strong and saying, okay, what is going to happen in the year and how can we come out stronger. Chuck, paint me a picture. When covid hits, what are the first steps that the CEO makes in the restaurant business? Or what did you have to do immediately as covid hits in order to adapt and sort of align everybody to this new reality that nobody knows what's going to happen? Yeah. You know, I think like a lot of people, you know, I can look at our financials in March 17th, the day after it was truly really announced on a national level that, hey, we need to lock down and start buying toilet paper. We really, at that point, had a look at everything. And we made some tough decisions, like close four stores immediately that I knew were going to be either high traffic like the mall location, the downtown location. That I knew the offices weren't going to be there. And so, we paused and we kind of evaluated what the true impact was going to be. And we took a hit pretty immediate, like a lot of people. And then we started getting strategic and thinking about, okay, what do we need to do. We went to our partners, as I mentioned earlier, the third party delivery services that we use. We went to our POS system and said, "Okay, how do we make this easier for the guest?" And we pivoted to that pretty quickly. And we've seen some of our competitors. You take, like [--], they did make shift drive-thrus in their parking lot because they knew they had to compete with the burger places that have drive thru. So, we knew that we needed to make it as easy as possible for the guests, you know, where possible to offer curbside. And we had some inherent challenges, but we worked through those. And, you know, and I think just telling the teams, the general managers like, "Hey, communicate with your team, let them know what's going on, let's help them take care of themselves." We have to obviously cut back a lot of hours, help them figure out how to get themselves taken care of, whether it was how to get on employment or whatever the case may be. Because we're all in this together. And we had to furlough some people immediately and have a communication with them. Because at the end of the day, the hope was everybody was going to come back. And we wanted to make sure that they were all still there. And so we're still fighting that. I have three people on furlough right now, still in that the catering department and the downtown LA store that I mentioned earlier, that's temporarily closed. But I've talked to those three people every other week. And they're ready to come back and they're anxious. And they've all taken part time jobs because they've had to. But they know that I'm committed to them. And as soon as we can get them back, we will. I think that one of the hardest things to deal with as a leader in any situation, and especially in this situation, is this uncertainty in communicating through that uncertainty. And one of the things that I've been hearing a lot is this effort to over communicate and under communicate. Especially in the time like covid-19. And I think that when you're mentioning that you're maintaining this the responsibility towards them and maintaining that communication, then I think that that's exactly the inspiration that I'm looking at as I'm talking to a lot of others. Chuck, before we leave, I want to thank you for being so generous with your time, both here and with Asian Box. Very funny coincidence that a guest that is on the show as well, Aliza Peleg, she's also a board member of Asian Box, which just blew my mind. But it makes perfect sense. She's a very close friend and very, very impressive. And I really want to thank you for sharing those insights and that personal experience, the CEO of a great chain that is just growing. And I can't wait to see where Asian box will continue to grow. But before we leave, I have to ask for the most important and difficult question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. Good question. I think consistent. You know, whenever you make decisions, you've got to be consistent. Just like we want the food to come out consistently, that way people know where they stand and know what's coming. I think, you know, right now evolving and I don't know if that's the best word, but we're evolving each day as to what happens in this industry and in the world. And we've got to be able to change with that and be open minded that what you did yesterday may not be as successful tomorrow if you're not open to change. And then, I don't know, I think communication once again is a key word. I don't know if that describes me, that's more like doing something. But, you know, I'm very big on communication. I think It's perfect description. Yeah. And all the managers and a lot of our employees, all the employees have my number. A lot of them will text just different ideas, and that's how we get better. And that's important. I appreciate you taking the time and being a big fan of our company. Wonderful. Chuck, thank you very, very much. This is great. Stay safe and stay healthy. And I'm looking forward to seeing you again around the restaurants. Likewise. Thanks.
