1 I think the biggest misconception about people that are tattooed or about getting tattooed is that, it has this stigma and people, think that people just want to look bad ass. Laura Schaack, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Good morning to you. Good noon. Yeah. Good afternoon over here. Good afternoon to you. Good night to me. That's what I love about, corona times have been very timing for a lot. But this getting to adapt to all these different times, it's been pretty, pretty fun, especially in a show like this. Thank you for joining me. I'm incredibly excited to talk about tattoos, of anything tattoos. Laura, are you a tattoo artist besides being a tattoo entrepreneur? So, I'm actually not a tattoo artist. And I think that's what has been the detriment of a lot of people that have attempted something in the tattoo and tech space. The majority of founders have been tattoo artists who decide maybe I want to build an app. I'm coming from a different angle, right? I've been working in tech for the last 10 years. So, like tech is my trade, tech is what I know, building apps is what I know. And I love tattooing. And I'm super heavily tattooed. And I've got a lot of tattoo artist friends here in New York. So, I'm definitely coming at it with a tech lens. And the learning curve is really the artistry side. But it's a really interesting topic to have as a learning curve. So, what does that mean when you say heavily tattooed? Give me the details of it. I'm heavily tattooed. I've got a full sleeve on my arm. I have, a couple, sort of random ones here and there, about half my left leg done. I love that. So, before we get into the tattoo space, who are you Laura? Give me the rundown of how you got to be a tattoo entrepreneur in tech and we'll dive into that intersection a little bit later. But I want to learn a little bit more about you right now. Yes. So, I kind of hop on upon the tech scene, right? And it happened, I think before it got really, really popular. And then Silicon Valley came out. And now every gen Z or just wants to be a founder and be their own boss. And that's really cool. But there's a lot more to it than that, right? Those are really hard. But there's a lot of pressure a lot of stress, a lot of constant work. So, it really wasn't romanticized for me, honestly. I was working in a international nonprofit space, actually. And I needed something more fast paced. I came here to New York when I was 17, went to NYU, got out, started working in the nonprofit space and was like, this is great and I love that I'm making an impact, but it's not enough of an impact for me. So, I need a type of industry that is super fast paced, that is going a mile a minute, that is ready to try really innovative, really risky things to see if that's the optimal way of doing things that probably only describes the startup industry, to be honest to you. So, I sort of accidentally moved into the startup space. I was one of the first employees at an incubator that moved European SaaS companies and integrated them into the US market. I lived abroad. I worked in Madrid, Spain, for a while. So, I think these European entrepreneurs were sort of like, great, she has European experience. And also, she's the only American on the team. We need a little both on the team. So, this really took a chance. I sat there and I took this job at 23 or 4. But I thought I just gonna travel Europe. That was what I thought I was doing. I didn't know at the time that I was kind of entering the early stage tech startup space. Little did I know, fast forward not even six months, and I'm going to pitch competitions and I'm talking about go-to-market strategy, and I'm talking about product market fit, liaisoning with CEOs and CTOs from Europe way earlier than I probably should have in my professional career. And sort of went on to really be really well integrated into the startup scene here in New York. Right? So, I also joined some startups to build them from the very ground up. I went through a number of accelerator programs here in New York. I'm in here for one now, actually. And I think in a little bit after that, I also worked at some app development firms It's little different but they're understanding of the tech side of things. So, the idea for Tattd came about much further along than than whenever I started it, right? I've had this idea for almost five years. I only started it about a year ago because I came to the point where I was like, first of all, it took me a long time to become brave enough to do it, right? Like, I had seen founders. I'd seen the really ugly side, like the really scary side, the really tense side. I work for the startups that aren't like, the Twitters of the world where you just get free snacks all the time. But, you know, there's some people I'll meet on every the events, some people are like, "Oh, yeah, I work in the startup industry, too." And I'm like, "But which type?" I work to the type where you're unpaid, working on the founder's apartment building. Like we've had different experiences. Do you know what I mean? But I finally came to a point in my career, I was like, okay, I've had sort of this trifecta of experience, right? I have worked in incubators where I'm seeing companies at scale. So, the SaaS companies were moving over are like series A, Series B level, 7, 8 years old, really ready to scale, they have a lot of capital behind them. I've seen things launch with very little to no money from the very ground up, and I finally have, after working on some app development firms, a thorough understanding of the technology side of things. So, I feel like I had sort of this trifecta of experience that would allow me to start Tattd and make it really, really successful. Even though I had this idea for a long time. So, hopefully, that's what I'm doing. That's amazing. So, let's go back just a little bit the intersection of you. You have this idea for Tattd for about five years. And we're talking about the tattoo market and we're talking about a marketplace that matches tattoo artists with people that are looking for their artists. And so, talk to me a little bit about the market, because I really know nothing about the tattoo industry. I've been thinking, and if my mom and my dad and my girlfriend listen to this, then I'm in trouble, but I've been interested to understand what is the tattoo market? Why are people getting tattoos? What is the benefit or what does it do to them emotionally or psychologically? So, please teach me a little bit about what's happening there. Absolutely. So, I think the biggest misconception about people that are tattooed or about getting tattooed is that, it has this stigma. And people think that people just want to look badass. And everyone has that story of like their drunk sorority sister that got some horrible tattoo or whatever the case may be. And we all smoke on the cigarettes and maybe ride motorcycles and like probably will curse at you in a coffee shop line, you know what I mean? Like, this is the idea of people that are tattooed. And it is so inaccurate. And I need like mainstream media to stop making that portrayal. I think people need to open their eyes to the actual community of people that are tattooed. Tattooing is an art. So funnily enough, half my coursework at NYU was art history. Whenever I was like, a child, I volunteered very young as early as I could get a job at the art museum. I grew up in Austin, Texas, in Austin. Like I thoroughly have an understanding of fine art. And tattooing is an art, right? These people are usually like illustrators or painters and sort of come and start tattooing. So, tattooing is really significant to the tattoo artists, but also a lot of the times to the person getting a tattoo. Right? People get a tattoo of sort of like in memoriam of people that have passed. People get tattooing because it makes them feel empowered about their body. You know what I mean? it's really closely aligned with their identity and it's something that is really special to people and is a way to express themselves. Right? It's not something that people go and say, "Now, I feel really cool and people can't talk to me anymore." That's not it at all. It's actually extremely special. And I think millennials are really kind of getting a hold of that. Millennials and Gen Z, people can say a lot about them, but they really do push boundaries and they really do sort of defy the status quo. And I think that's really benefited the tattooing industry. Right? They're no longer pulling away from that stigma, and people are getting into it. There's also a trend within that sort of mentality that is sort of like a personal brand customization. You know what I mean? And it's a question of who am I and how do I differentiate. What I remember growing up, it was all about fitting in. I think I was just sort of on the cusp of that change. So, it's really interesting for someone my age, I'm 29, if anyone wonder. But I think it's interesting for someone of my age that saw what it was like that the mental was to fit in and become homogenous. And now I have seen a huge shift, and the mental is absolutely not that if anything, it's the antithesis of that. It's more like, who am I, do I fit in with this people or do I not. And what is my individuality mean, and how do I express or define that individuality. And so, I think that also sort of spurring more and more. I mean, the number of that show the industry is increasing, but I think, that's why. So, give me a little bit about the numbers of the industry. Do we know how many of the tattoo artists are out there? What is the demand for it? How many tattoos are being administered on an annual basis, stuff like that? Yeah. We know that there's 145 million Americans that are tattooed, which is just about half. Wait. Half of Americans are tattooed? That's right. What? That sounds crazy. A crazy number. That's in 2019 data. 145 million. Half of the US is tattooed. And half of them have more than one tattoo. It's not just like one little one off. You know what I mean? A quarter of Americans have more than one tattoo? Yeah. That's like the best engagement of any product I've ever heard. I mean, it's amazing. And it's like, it's incredible to me that not a lot of people have really tried to harness the space. This is a huge market, It's a huge market and it's only growing. it's gigantic. Americans are spending 1.7 billion dollars a year on tattoos. Billion with a B. It's crazy. And I think there's a lot to say for the fact that it's sort of this distraught industry. There's not a center fine force to it. There's not really leaders in the market because all of these are sort of individuals. They're all individual freelancers. They are small businesses, the small shop in the corner of that neighborhood that you go to because you befriended. That's so interesting. Yeah. How do you explain then that there is such a big stigma around tattoos, yet, half of Americans have tattoos? Yeah. It's interesting. I think people maybe get tattoos and then maybe distance themselves from the tattoo community. So, there's a difference between some that had a tattoo and someone that is part of this cult, if you will, for lack of a better word. And you know, people are very insular about allowing other people into that sort of cult mentality. Right? And I think that has a lot to do with the fact that they have been stigmatized and have been semi, not discriminated against in a way that many other groups are for many other reasons. But the stigma has sort of allowed heavily tattooed people, people that are a lot more heavily in the industry than you know, just having a one of tattoo. Unless you really sort of band together and nearly reject other people entering the tattoo industry. Which is also something that Tattd is fighting, right? So, I remember the first time I went to go get a big piece. I walk into the studio and I was like, "Okay, I have a tattoo idea. This is what I want. Can someone talk to me?" And I got the stink eye of a lifetime from this woman. And she was just like, "Can you just look up our artist and contact the artist directly?" You don't do that. Like as if she's like, "Get out." Wow. I didn't know it operated like that. You can't just go to a shop because the shops are literally just shares essentially that they rent out to people. Like you contract with the tattoo artist. Yes. I had no idea. I thought you walk in and you say, "You look like a great artist. Come here and I want you to draw something on me." No, not personally custom. So, I mean, they have like again, like pushing towards to stigma, but on the street with all the bars on any given city, there's probably tattoo shop that you can probably walk in and choose something off of a laminated page in a binder and get that tattoo. That is not at all how the majority. I thought it was more like a haircut, that you have a big bunch of different styles and you can come in and say, "I want this style now." I had no idea. A haircut you would have forever. Right. So, now it makes so much more sense to me why there needs to be a dedicated marketplace. Because if you're contracting the artist, first of all, it doesn't make too much sense to me that you only have access to the local artists that are you're seeing in your a geographical area, because if you're getting a tattoo for life, maybe you're willing to travel a little bit farther for that special artists, five hour drive, that can do something very, very special. So, now it makes perfect sense. Please keep going. Absolutely. Absolutely. And there's also an issue with sort of the data being very distraught. So, when you're choosing a tattoo artist, having all of the different data points available to you is actually essential. You can't just have one. So, when I say data points, I mean the artist's location. I would love to go and get tattooed in Tel Aviv, probably not today. You know what I mean? So, location of the artist is essential. Price also is essential. Because prices can range from, they usually go in hourly rates. They can range from like a $100 an hour, I've seen some four $800 an hour. $800 an hour? $800 an hour. I have seen it. These are like celebrity tattoo artist, but still. I think I'm switching profession. You should. I think my fallbacks should totally be tattoo artistry, you know what I mean if this isn't work out. That's incredible. How many hours does it usually take to get a significant tattoo? Yeah. It can be anywhere from, three to twelve. It really depends on the size and the detail. Really? Oh yeah. The average tattoo cost is about $2500. The average tattoo cost is $2500? Yes. Or that's maybe the average amount that a person has spent on their tattoos. That is still incredible. It's in the thousands. Yeah. My tattoo is worth thousands. If I'm comparing it for a second to the streaming industry, that's probably pretty much what a person would pay for Spotify, Netflix, Hulu, over their entire lifetime. Right. Exactly. So, we're pretty much on the same size. Okay. So, that's fascinating. Talk to me a little bit about Tattd. And talk to me about the challenges, about the traction, what insights have you gained as you've been building this marketplace? Yeah. Absolutely. So, what we built is essentially an intelligent search where we're combining the ability to search by location, price range, specialization. So, speaking about to sort of my history with art, a tattoo artist specializes in a way that is very significant whenever you're making that choice. So, a tattoo artist that does impressionist tattoos like a [--] fine art doesn't do like pop art, Andy Warhol stuff. That's not the same person. In the same way, if you want a tattoo artist to do like script tattoo or if you want a tattoo artist to do Americana, you're not going to go to someone that does the opposite thing. You know what I mean? So, you need to know their specialization actually. So, a tattoo artist by specialization and you can even search by keyword if you want to see a certain image, if you want to see a butterfly in their portfolio, fine, you can search by a certain image as well, right? So, you have all of these options. Typically, what the user would have to do is go to Yelp if they want to know the location of the studio. They would have to go to Instagram and go on a hash tag of specialization. Find a great artist, wait there in Berlin. There's no cohesive data. So, that's what Tattd has brought together. The app itself has actually gone beautifully. Which is probably because I've made history in actually building app. So, it's like, that part has gone really, really smoothly. And we've got an amazing, amazing responsiveness. The number one thing that I hear back is how is this not been built before. Right. After this conversation, I'm shocked myself. I have been shocked this whole time that I've been waiting for someone else to do it. I don't even know if I want to do this. Because this is a little work you guys someone else needs to do this. And no one did. And so, here we are. But I love it. It's like a labor of love. And watching it sort of gain traction and come about. I mean, in the first month we had 2,000 downloads. We're only opening 12 launch cities, the 12 most tattooed cities in the US. What are some of them? New York, LA, Austin, Miami, Denver, Portland, Houston, San Diego, San Francisco, Chicago. All of the main ones that you might imagine. And I believe that these are also the 12 main tech hubs of the US. Yeah. Funnily enough, the urban centers seem to follow both of those trends for sure. But what I want to do is make sure that there is a strong database in each of these cities. Right? So, imagine I just like launch, anywhere in the US. What if you're in a Richmond and like only two artists have sign up there? That's going to be a horrible experience. And here I am looking at my app and say, "There's no artist here actually." Like, bye. So, I was like, all right, we need to concentrate and limit a number of cities, build a really strong database. I want hundreds of artists, like if not, like a thousand plus in each city, and then I can launch and get even more. I want everyone on this app. The kind of other thing to mention is that it's free for both sides, which no other platform has been for artists. Which is so horrible for them, because these artists, you know, they're trying to make a living off of their art. And it's not easy. They have to pay for their own health insurance. Even if they're in a studio, they pay for all their own materials. All the ink you see, which is very expensive, all the machines, very expensive, all insurances for their actual art. It's literally everything they have to actually pay for. And then a studio takes a cut on top of that. So, making an artist pay for a platform in order to promote themselves can make any sense to me. So, it is actually free for both sides. And we still figure out a way to monetize. But that was really the important to me just because it is a huge mission to empower creative industries through tech and allow these people to not be paycheck to paycheck for their whole lives. So, that was really important. The other thing that is of note is that as I was becoming more acquainted to the community and this was very much a grassroots movement. Right? So, instead of going from the very ground up and like, you know, going to top tattoo artist in the US and getting them to endorse us or whatever it is, I was like, all right, they already have a following. Like, they already have enough business. I want this to be a grassroots movement. I want it to be real. I want to speak for the people. And that means for us as users, but also for the tattoo artist. We did tons of, sort of micro influencer outreach. We did an ambassador program where literally I would take 30 minute calls with every single artist that partnered with us that wanted to be on the platform and told them about the mission and heard about their pain points and all that. And we got all these people sort of behind it. Now, as I became more and more acquainted with the community and probably after, as we're building our social media presence and sort of defining our brand, for me and my value is that diversity and inclusion of all people, of every gender, race and shape and size was always going to be a part of this. I thought I was going to get sort of a nod from the tattoo community. Like, yes, that's what we believe to. Thank you so much. Moving on. Because of the counterculture, right? It's a counterculture. In my head, that meant, that it was not subject to the white male paradigm, you know. So, it was like, great, okay, we probably don't have to worry about that. Little did I know, the more I connected with people, they were merely informing me of my own mission. And I really connected with people, they were saying, "Thank you so much for being such a strong voice for the LGBTQ community and tattooing." And I was like, "Am I a strong voice you had?" I thought we were just being inclusive and being diverse. And the more and more I realized that it actually is a huge issue in tattoo culture, which is shocking to me personally. But it is at the end of the day, when you think about it, there's no HR department for tattoo artists. You know what I mean? There's tons of stories about women being harassed by shop owners, you know what I mean? Or worse. So, there's no one that's able to police that, or is able to set these standards. So, Tattd became to be a really proactive voice for that, nearly accidentally, to be really honest with you. And the more and more I got the response and I had people reach out to me saying, "I will work for you for free." I had creative directors, I had interns. I had developer reaching out to me that is connected to the community that says, I had literally, some come to me and said, "I am gay and I have never been comfortable walking into tattoo parlor. Thank you so much. I would love to get a tattoo, but I just don't even feel comfortable. I want to work for you." That's just remarkable. And it's incredible. Laura, thank you. Thank you for this inspiration. Thank you for sharing these stories. And it's amazing how that the side effect consequences come about. And I'm sure that that fulfillment of hearing these remarks by people that haven't felt comfortable showing their passion or exhibiting their excitement over this industry, it's just, it's really, really great. So, it's a really fantastic job on that. Thank you for doing good for the world. Before we leave, I have to ask you for the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself The hardest question. The hardest question. I would say authentic. You usually get sort of me unfiltered at all times. For better or worse, authentic. Passionate, if you didn't already notice. Very passionate at everything I do. Yeah. Definitely. Definitely An adventurous I would say. I feel like I usually am really ready to try something new and go out on a limb and take a risk. I love that. Laura, thank you very, very much. Best of luck with Tattd. I know it's just the beginning of a long journey, but it sounds like it's off to a great beginning. So, best of luck and I look forward to following the journey closely. Take care. Absolutely. Thank you so much.
