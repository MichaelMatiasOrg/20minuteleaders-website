1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,160
If you don't have the charisma

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,760
or the talent to be a communicator,

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,400
then make sure

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,400
that you surround yourself

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,960
through your team

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,520
or through your partners

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,760
and suppliers and advertising

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,920
and marketing and PR agencies

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,840
with people who understand communication

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,544
and they know

11
00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:22,840
how to deliver this communication

12
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,840
on your behalf.

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,960
George Kotsolios, thank you so much

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,280
for joining me on 20 Minute leaders.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,840
Welcome.

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,120
Thank you very much, Michael.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,920
It's a pleasure to meet you

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,520
and pleasure to be here.

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,040
It's a very, very big pleasure of mine.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,160
There is going to be

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,720
some interesting lessons

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,280
that we're going to learn today together.

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,920
So, we have to get started

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,080
because we only have 20 minutes.

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,760
George, tell me

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,720
a little bit about yourself.

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,440
You're a lot into communications,

28
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,640
public relations

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,040
in the international spectrum.

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,680
Your business is primarily in Dubai,

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,680
which I'm very excited

32
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,880
to be visiting in just a few hours.

33
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,280
So, I am extremely excited

34
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,080
to talk to you here before that.

35
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,960
George, who are you?

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,560
Okay.

37
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,400
Well, I've been in PR communications

38
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,600
for the last 26, 27 years.

39
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,600
But instead of me starting off

40
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,400
from the beginning,

41
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,840
I'd rather start from the end

42
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,040
because that's I think

43
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,160
where the interest

44
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,440
for you and the audience

45
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,320
who will hopefully be spending

46
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,400
20 minutes of their life

47
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,200
to watch you and me having a chat,

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
would be more interesting.

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,880
And that's because three years ago,

50
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,160
I had just turned 50,

51
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,720
when I actually launched

52
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,760
my own company, in effect,

53
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,960
I became an entrepreneur

54
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,880
at the age of 50.

55
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,640
Not very common.

56
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:12,920
Yes.

57
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,160
26, 27 years of career

58
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,680
and all of a sudden

59
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:19,080
I opened my own company.

60
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,080
But the reason that I did

61
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,120
that were purely existential.

62
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,040
Because, you know,

63
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,680
I had just been made redundant

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,720
and I needed income

65
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,160
to continue supporting

66
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,680
for myself and my family.

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,280
So, this is when I decided that,

68
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,760
okay, it may be time

69
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
to try something of my own,

70
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,960
effectively become my own boss.

71
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,800
And there you have it.

72
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,360
And I guess lesson number one,

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,120
is it's never too late.

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,440
You know, it's you know,

75
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,320
you don't really need

76
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,600
to get your master's degree

77
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,480
or PhD from Stanford University

78
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,400
and jump on the bandwagon

79
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,600
for entrepreneurship all at once.

80
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,360
You know, try and pace yourself.

81
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,560
Go out, experience life,

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,480
get a real job, you know, learn.

83
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,760
And the time will come when

84
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,520
you are going to feel ready.

85
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,840
The circumstances are going to be ready.

86
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,773
And the timing is going to be

87
00:03:16,774 --> 00:03:18,887
the right one for you to go

88
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:21,800
and reach out for your dreams.

89
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,040
Yes? Sorry, you're going to

90
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,960
ask something, Michael?

91
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,520
I have to get into the mindset

92
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,280
of 50 years old existential thread.

93
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,960
You know, you need to bring income

94
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,480
for yourself and your family.

95
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,600
And you're saying, you know,

96
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,720
why don't I start a business,

97
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,920
why don't I become an entrepreneur.

98
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,680
This is something that

99
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,880
a lot of 21, 22 year-olds to say.

100
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,200
Not so many 50 year-olds.

101
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,360
I think that's pretty inspiring.

102
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,440
So, I'd love to just understand

103
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,560
a little bit better

104
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,640
your thought process

105
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,600
as you're making that big decision,

106
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,720
that big leap.

107
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,200
Yeah. Well, I mean,

108
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:59,000
the number one thing that I believe

109
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,880
any entrepreneur must have

110
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,440
no matter what age he or she is

111
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,920
or how old they are and feel,

112
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,480
is passion and experience

113
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,520
and deep understanding

114
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,120
and knowledge of the area

115
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,640
or the sector that they

116
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,960
are about to embark on.

117
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,480
So, in my case,

118
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,080
as you introduced me earlier,

119
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,520
I have a long experience

120
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,080
in PR, communications journalism.

121
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,880
That's what I was trained to do.

122
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,960
And that's what I've been doing

123
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,760
for a quarter of a century

124
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,760
or more during my career.

125
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,920
And I took that passion

126
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,960
and I turn it into my own startup.

127
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,320
Now, the good thing was

128
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,280
that not only did I continue do

129
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,960
what I knew very well doing

130
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,840
for such a long time,

131
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,320
but in a way I rediscovered my mojo

132
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,360
for lack of a better experience.

133
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,160
Wow.

134
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,160
And that happened because

135
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,280
my first clients,

136
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,680
when I opened my company,

137
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,960
happened to be a young

138
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,200
aspiring tech startup entrepreneur

139
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,000
back in Dubai, where I am still am.

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,760
This guy had a long experience working

141
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,240
for other startups until

142
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,920
he took a decision one day to open

143
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,800
his own health tech startup company.

144
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,920
He had the knowledge, the experience

145
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,320
and the passion which he conveyed to me.

146
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,680
You know, there were days

147
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,320
that we will have a long argument

148
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,760
about petty things.

149
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,440
But that helped me understand and realize

150
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,040
how passionate he was feeling

151
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,600
about his own company.

152
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,240
And I guess that is a second lesson,

153
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,880
Michael, for all of you today.

154
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:55,440
It's without the passion

155
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,000
and without the experience

156
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
having done the journey before,

157
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,640
not necessarily as an entrepreneur,

158
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,920
but working for others

159
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,240
is going to be a difficult thing.

160
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,000
It's going to be dangerous,

161
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,480
is not going to be as fluent

162
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,960
as we will feel once you have

163
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,960
this passion inherently inside you.

164
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,120
Right.

165
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
So, your time

166
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,280
that experience was pivotal

167
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,200
in your ability to streamline your work,

168
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,000
to know what you're doing,

169
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,560
to be fluent with your business

170
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,200
and to actually be successful at it

171
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,720
because you're actually providing value.

172
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,698
So, what is the business

173
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,840
that you started as an entrepreneur

174
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,040
at 50 years old?

175
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,920
And what skills did you bring with you

176
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,640
from your previous work life?

177
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,400
So, what I do is basically

178
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,560
developing content,

179
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,760
developing messaging,

180
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,680
developing positioning,

181
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,880
developing campaigns,

182
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,520
public relations campaigns that generate

183
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,840
what we call in my language,

184
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,240
in my industry, earned publicity.

185
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,920
So, it's not like advertising

186
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,760
where you go and pay Time magazine

187
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,240
or New York Times

188
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,120
or Gulf news, it was closer

189
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,360
to where I live,

190
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,240
in order to place an advert

191
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,480
in the pages.

192
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,520
This is publicity that you earn

193
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,920
through public relations tactics.

194
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,680
And that is what I do.

195
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,960
And public relations

196
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,840
is very, very important.

197
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,720
In fact, your question brings me

198
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,120
to the third lesson

199
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,640
I want to sort of share

200
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,400
with our audience today.

201
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,520
So, having the timing right for you

202
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,200
to open, it is number one.

203
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,920
Then, having the experience

204
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,720
and the passion to do it

205
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,840
is number two.

206
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,080
But then, being able

207
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,000
to communicate your passion

208
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,920
and communicate this vision

209
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,680
of yours effectively across

210
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,520
your stakeholder universe,

211
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,200
which once you launch a company,

212
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,840
is going to be comprising

213
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,120
of a very diverse group of people

214
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,000
including your employees,

215
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,640
including your B2B partners,

216
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,560
including your B2C consumers

217
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,720
where you want them

218
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,280
to download your app,

219
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,040
including your regulators stakeholders,

220
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,360
government stakeholders,

221
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,200
all the way to investors.

222
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,920
You need to be able to communicate

223
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,600
these to the different audiences.

224
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,080
And basically

225
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,760
that is the third lesson.

226
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:28,600
If you don't have the charisma

227
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,160
or the talent to be a communicator,

228
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,840
then make sure

229
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,240
that you surround yourself

230
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,400
through your team

231
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,960
or through your partners

232
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,200
and suppliers and advertising

233
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,360
and marketing and PR agencies

234
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,280
with people who understand communication

235
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,920
and they know

236
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,240
how to deliver this communication

237
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,960
on your behalf.

238
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,280
So, you know, I'm surrounded

239
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,760
by a lot of young entrepreneurs.

240
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,000
Communication is not,

241
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,520
I wouldn't say that it's our forte.

242
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,640
I think that coming from more

243
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,880
of an engineering background

244
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,320
and being excited about the product

245
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,520
and technology is one thing,

246
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,762
but like you're mentioning,

247
00:09:03,763 --> 00:09:05,200
our success it often depends

248
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,800
on our ability to communicate.

249
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,720
And it doesn't really matter

250
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,680
how good our product is,

251
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,240
if we're not able to communicate that

252
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,880
it's meaningless.

253
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,000
It's what makes, differentiate

254
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,040
a successful startup from a failure.

255
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,360
I mean,

256
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,080
there's plenty of studies out there,

257
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,040
but one that has really stuck

258
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:27,720
with my mind is that, out of the hundreds

259
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,400
of startup companies that

260
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:36,440
they are launched globally, 97 will fail.

261
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,960
Just three of them will make it

262
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,840
a successful exit

263
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,640
or a successful acquisition

264
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,520
or maybe go to have an IPO.

265
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,320
Just 3%.

266
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:47,160
And I believe firmly

267
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,840
that the key quality,

268
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,800
the differentiating factor between

269
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,360
those who make it

270
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,120
and those don't is the ability

271
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,695
to successfully communicate

272
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:02,080
the vision, the passion,

273
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,720
the solution and the technology.

274
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,240
Because technology

275
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,040
is pretty much the same.

276
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,680
Solutions are pretty much

277
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
the same, because

278
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,520
we've got similar problems, right?

279
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,880
It's how you communicate your solution

280
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,760
to the various stakeholders

281
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,920
you want to engage with

282
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,400
that differentiates you from the crowd.

283
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,120
Michael, you just mentioned

284
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,760
you work for a VC.

285
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,840
I've got a VC clients,

286
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,080
which is actually based out of Greece.

287
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,224
They deal with a lot of European

288
00:10:32,225 --> 00:10:36,040
as well as Dubai and UAE based startups.

289
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,520
And the single thing he keeps telling me

290
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,080
that he and his team are looking into

291
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,720
a young tech startup entrepreneur

292
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,104
who sends them their decks for evaluation,

293
00:10:49,105 --> 00:10:52,131
in order for the fund to invest in them,

294
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:54,840
is to be able to communicate effectively.

295
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,240
That is the number one.

296
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,200
Because the solution is here today

297
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,040
in one shape and form.

298
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,480
Trust me,

299
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,960
a year or two down the line,

300
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,560
the package is going to look differently.

301
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:09,480
100%.

302
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:11,400
So, George, give me a little bit

303
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,360
of insight of what it means

304
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,880
to communicate effectively.

305
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
Because obviously

306
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,455
it's a lifelong skill

307
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:18,000
that takes a lot of expertise

308
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,920
and a lot of experience.

309
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,760
But there must be some things

310
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,480
that we as young entrepreneurs

311
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,600
can embrace to be more cognizant of it

312
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,480
and to really make sure

313
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,160
that the other side

314
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,800
is understanding the value

315
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,880
that we're trying to provide.

316
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,840
So, what are some ways

317
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,200
that we as young entrepreneurs,

318
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,840
can better communicate effectively?

319
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,680
Absolutely.

320
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,400
This is a process, Michael.

321
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,080
It doesn't happen overnight.

322
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,680
You need to have in place resources,

323
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,480
budgets and a robust plan

324
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,800
that eventually is going

325
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,520
to take you there,

326
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,440
eventually going to help you

327
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,080
communicate better.

328
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,120
Let me start

329
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,040
with the three basic steps

330
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,360
of the process.

331
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,456
The first basic step is to be able to

332
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:08,920
let's say, set your through north.

333
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,320
Okay?

334
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,800
What do I mean by that?

335
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,600
You need to be able

336
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,000
to develop a positioning

337
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,480
for your tech startup.

338
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,800
An overarching positioning

339
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,640
that resonates simultaneously

340
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,960
with every single different target group

341
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,480
you are trying to engage with.

342
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,960
And once you have

343
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,680
these solid in your mind,

344
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,920
then what you need to do

345
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,400
is to develop what we call

346
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,640
in our business,

347
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,120
a key messaging platform.

348
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,280
Which is, imagine like a house,

349
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,960
I'll try to make it a picture for you.

350
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,280
Please.

351
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,200
Imagine you've got a house.

352
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,440
There is a roof on top of the house.

353
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,480
Inside this roof, this is where your

354
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,400
overarching positioning statement

355
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,440
about your humble tech startup is.

356
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,080
Okay?

357
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,000
Which actually tells

358
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,440
where you want to go.

359
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,520
What is the solution

360
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,408
that you are developing,

361
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:16,560
why you are the best person

362
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,200
and your best company

363
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,840
to bring it to market.

364
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,720
Right.

365
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,120
Under this, let's say roof,

366
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,080
you've got windows, okay?

367
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,440
Now, depending on the complexity

368
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,600
of your tech startup,

369
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,160
you are going, and the number

370
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,440
of stakeholder audiences

371
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,400
that you want to impart,

372
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,160
you will have

373
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,120
an equivalent number of windows.

374
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,720
Right?

375
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,440
Right.

376
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,360
The cases that I have dealt with

377
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,600
and I have dealt with startups

378
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,360
in the health tech industry

379
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,880
from the last mile delivery industry,

380
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,400
from the fintech industry,

381
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,000
the food industry, e-commerce,

382
00:13:57,001 --> 00:14:01,120
you name it, I've done it all.

383
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,440
The number of target audiences

384
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,000
varies between three and five

385
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,320
depending on the complexity.

386
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,000
The three key audiences are usually B2B,

387
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,825
which means these are the partners

388
00:14:15,826 --> 00:14:17,920
that you want to influence

389
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,280
to bring over.

390
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,177
Number two is the consumer.

391
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:23,440
You know, the people that

392
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,200
they are going to be making use

393
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,240
of your application,

394
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,680
whether you are health tech

395
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,360
or a food delivery app.

396
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,960
And the third is the investors.

397
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,320
Because startups, you know,

398
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,800
they need to encourage investment

399
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,560
from VCs, for private equity firms

400
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
and individual investors

401
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,080
and so on and so forth.

402
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,800
So, for each of these three,

403
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,280
let's say, key target audiences,

404
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,640
then you need to have

405
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,640
another opening statement

406
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,960
that resonates uniquely to them.

407
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,920
Okay?

408
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,640
And once you communicate

409
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,720
uniquely to them,

410
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,960
then you need to have

411
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,920
what we call a series

412
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,600
of three normal key messages

413
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,680
that bring that sub opening to life.

414
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,880
It sounds a little bit complicated.

415
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,000
If it's not very clear,

416
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,560
please ask me to explain it again.

417
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,720
No, no, no. It's perfectly clear.

418
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,240
And the thing that makes

419
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,280
most sense is this

420
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,960
is the fact that you need

421
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,320
to make it unique to the person

422
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,000
that you're talking to.

423
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,040
I think I'm assuming that one

424
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,120
of the biggest pitfalls of entrepreneurs,

425
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,520
especially young entrepreneurs,

426
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,000
is that you're using the same messaging,

427
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,800
the same deck,

428
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,280
the same PR released

429
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,960
to the every single person.

430
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,000
But that's not necessarily

431
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,360
the message that they want to hear.

432
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,400
And you have to stand out

433
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,680
from the crowd.

434
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,280
You got it exactly right.

435
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,120
You know, the message

436
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,840
that the investor wants to hear

437
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,149
is completely different

438
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,040
to the one that the consumer

439
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,120
wants to hear.

440
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,720
And definitely not similar to the one

441
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,480
of the B2B audience wants to hear.

442
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,120
Right?

443
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,400
So, that is a philosophy

444
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,680
that I have brought

445
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,960
and I have developed

446
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,840
to communicate, to develop rather,

447
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,840
the messaging for my tech startup plans.

448
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,320
So, that is the first step

449
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,440
of the process.

450
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Once you've got these all done

451
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,640
and dusted and signed off by the client,

452
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,840
then the next step is what we call

453
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,680
media training and message delivery.

454
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,440
Then we sit

455
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,880
with the tech startup founder

456
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,920
and co-founders and owners

457
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,760
and we take them through

458
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,200
a rigorous four hour session.

459
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,055
The last few months

460
00:16:28,056 --> 00:16:29,760
we'd been doing it over Zoom.

461
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,440
But previously, of course

462
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,760
it was physical meetings

463
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,906
where we have on the back

464
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:39,120
your drop, you know, the deck

465
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:40,920
that we have developed

466
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,160
for the messaging.

467
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,520
And then we take them through

468
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,560
a process which includes

469
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,200
a number of a real life

470
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,760
case studies explaining to them

471
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,600
the difference between

472
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,920
a good interview and a bad interview.

473
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,600
Then will take them

474
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,800
through practical sort of workshops

475
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,120
where we try them, you know,

476
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,440
how they answer a question

477
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,720
before they go through the trade

478
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,480
and how they answer that at the end.

479
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,680
So because, you know,

480
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,840
as we said earlier,

481
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,146
communication is key, you know.

482
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:15,160
It's great to have the positioning right,

483
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,560
the messaging right.

484
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,960
But if you don't have it naturally,

485
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,440
if you're not a natural communicator,

486
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,200
then this media training helps people,

487
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,109
help them to organize their thoughts

488
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,173
and help them to sort of

489
00:17:31,174 --> 00:17:33,960
know what to say, when to say it

490
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,520
and what not to say,

491
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,280
which also also very, very important

492
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,840
That sounds very important.

493
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,720
And the third step is engagement.

494
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,040
Right?

495
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,760
So, once we've got the messaging right,

496
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,720
once we've got the training all sorted,

497
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,880
then it's time to engage

498
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,680
with our universe, stakeholder universe.

499
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,640
And that includes

500
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,960
a number of stakeholders.

501
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,400
It could be for instance,

502
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,640
a panel discussion over Zoom

503
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,440
where the startup entrepreneur

504
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,720
will go and be part of the panel.

505
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,480
So, he needs to have his messaging

506
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
there available in his mind

507
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,800
and be able to deliver that message.

508
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,440
It could be a TEDx speech.

509
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,400
You know, being there 10, 15 minutes,

510
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,920
talking about the solution, the problem,

511
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,840
but also making it relevant

512
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,680
to his company.

513
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:23,960
Right.

514
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,160
Or it could be a media interview,

515
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,360
live TV or live radio,

516
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,680
which is very, very unforgiving,

517
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,560
by the way.

518
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,480
Because if you say something live

519
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,800
on telly, on radio and it's wrong,

520
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,880
then you know, khalas,

521
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,240
it's now going to flop, obviously.

522
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,040
But also what we do, as a company,

523
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,200
as a business, is then

524
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,068
we package this information

525
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:48,240
depending on the occasion

526
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,480
and into what we call,

527
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,560
press releases or feature articles.

528
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,640
And then we take

529
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,760
these written information

530
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,480
and we work with our media contacts

531
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,800
to make sure that we place them

532
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,120
in the magazines, in the newspapers,

533
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,720
in online publications and so on.

534
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,680
And that's how

535
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,160
we start developing the visibility,

536
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,840
the awareness that I am here,

537
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,840
I am the owner of this company.

538
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,960
My company does X, Y and Z.

539
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,560
We are solving this problem.

540
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,360
And that's how eventually,

541
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,920
you are going to get noticed.

542
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,600
Otherwise, it doesn't matter

543
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,080
if you have the best solution,

544
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,400
as long as nobody knows it,

545
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,440
it's not going to be good enough.

546
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:32,929
I love it.

547
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:34,744
George, that was inspiring

548
00:19:34,745 --> 00:19:35,800
and fascinating.

549
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,960
Thank you so much for sharing

550
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,080
from your experience.

551
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,640
I think most of all

552
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,280
it's inspiring to see somebody

553
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,480
that is so passionate

554
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,080
about what they do.

555
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,880
In the end, your passion stands out

556
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,680
from every word

557
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,200
that you said here today.

558
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,960
So, thank you very much for that.

559
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,160
I want to thank you for being

560
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,720
so generous with your time.

561
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,480
And before we leave,

562
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,080
I have to ask you for three words

563
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,880
that you would use to describe yourself.

564
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,200
Oh, ouch.

565
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,560
Okay.

566
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,080
You go with that.

567
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,360
I would say curios is one.

568
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,392
And that comes

569
00:20:06,393 --> 00:20:09,000
from my journalism background.

570
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,560
I started as a journalist.

571
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,384
In journalism,

572
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:13,560
PR is very, very sort of relevant

573
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,520
in a way, because,

574
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,480
if you know how to write

575
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,480
as a journalist, then you know

576
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,480
how to write about everything.

577
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,920
So, curious is one.

578
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,280
And I would also say inquisitive,

579
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,200
which is pretty much similar

580
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,640
to curiosity.

581
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,800
So, that's two.

582
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,120
You want the third one as well.

583
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,720
Well, the third one,

584
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,080
I think I'm going to grant myself,

585
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,600
which is passionate, because

586
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,880
I've done over 250 of these episodes

587
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,800
and I can see very clearly

588
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,386
the passion that you're bringing

589
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:47,080
towards this, and it's just remarkable.

590
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,320
So, thank you for that.

591
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,560
Wow. Thank you so much.

592
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,040
Thank you so much, Michael.

593
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,800
Thank you.
