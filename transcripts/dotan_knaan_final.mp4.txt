1 I always prefer to do something than not to doing something. So whenever, even when wake up in the morning, I want to go jogging or not and I am tired, I'm not going to jog today. But I remember that whenever I'm doing something or when I do something, I never regret. Dotan Knaan, thank you for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you today? Good, good. Nice to meet you. Happy to be here. Thank you. We have a lot to cover. But before we cover all the mileage we have for this interview, we have to talk about your bike journeys. You started by mentioning to me that you traveled with your wife with 10 some of the bikes all across Europe, and you even traveled with the whole family on a non-competitive cycling event through Iowa, right? Yeah, yeah. Bike is me. I am the bike. So, also in the Silicon Valley I used to bike every day to work and back. Here in Israel, now I'm in Israel, also, we are in Tel Aviv because in Tel Aviv, you can cycle also everywhere. So, I try to avoid my car. And also it's good because my son is very, he's protesting against the climate change. So, I'm very proud to that my son can be proud of me, that I'm using bike, whenever I can. And yeah, as a student, I cycle with my wife for two months in Europe with bike. And again, then another trip and that was in Scandinavia. Then another time in Scotland. And then in United States also, I cycled of a lot. And including with my family one week we crossed Iowa from one side to the other. There is a big event called, RAGBRAI, and that was very, very good. I'm constantly in awe. The people that I'm speaking to, like yourself, you're so busy and you're so successful in your domain, yet you have these incredible passions and adventures and you don't do them lightly. You go all the way. You traveled 2,000 miles with your wife with ten. So, you travel all across Iowa with your family. I'm gaining inspiration for myself. But I have to go to the main event and to the main mileage. You're a researcher at Samsung. You're an expert in computer vision in augmented reality. And I'm especially excited for this episode because I'm excited to talk about what is augmented reality? And where are we heading, especially in the context of your work? So, Dotan, maybe, can you take me back a little bit about your journey into this computer vision space. And then, tell me a little bit about where we are? Okay. So, personally, my big one is more computer vision and also a bit of computer graphics. And for me, augmented reality, or virtual reality, we can discuss it, but that's why I like, it is about the integration. So, you take computer graphics and computer vision and integrate them and have something that you see. And for me also, that's also something that's for me is very important is the feedback. So, for me as a developer, that's I develop something and I get the feedback. I don't need someone to tell me if it's better or not. I see if it's better. I see the reality in front of me. You are the user. I'm the user. It's not only better algorithm that runs faster and someone say, oh, now it's faster, more efficient. What I like is just the interaction with the computer, with the screen. And if it's augmented reality, virtual reality is not only the screen, it could be also glasses. What drew you into computer vision starting out? Why going to computer vision? What drew you into computer vision? Yeah. So, to computer vision again, that's because of visual aspect. Because I see what I get and understand the world and how the computer can understand the world, and how computer can can learn and it's got just, I started 20 years ago, even more 25 years ago and it was not allowed so many cameras. Now everything is cameras. Every phone has a camera, amazing camera. So, the potential of computer vision just grew and grew and understanding of the images much, much better. And again the direction, having been being able to see what you're going, that's what I like the most. And what's also very interesting is, though, because for us, the human, it's you see something, it's so obvious what you see. But to teach a computer to understand what you see, it's a big challenge. And that's part of, now, when we have augmented reality, if you asked about augmented reality is, you have two parts, one is understanding the world because you have to visualize. So, maybe I'll just give a few words about what is augmented reality is also, there's virtual reality where you see only the virtual only the graphics. You don't see the actual world. You just see everything is graphics. And there's augmented reality or mixed reality. There are some differences between all that. But in general, let's call it augmented reality, that's you have the world, but on top of the world, you have some object that you add some information to the world. It could be, through the screen of the phone like, on the phone you see the world with a camera and also add some information. So, Google has a lot of the very good tool code that gives you a lot of information, you can use it and it just gets better and better because you understand the world. You can understand plan, you can understand where everything is located. Personally, I prefer as a developer to work with the glasses. In the glasses like HoloLens Microsoft and those other Magic Leap and other companies. That's for me, that's the magic, because then you really see the world and then you also put again, you put the graphics on top. That extra layer. Yeah, but extra layer. But that's even more challenging because you really have to understand the scene. You really have to understand, not only the scene and where to put something, but to also attract the head motion. So, you have to understand how the head moves. Because then you can really know how to render, how to locate the object in the right thing. And if you don't do it right, it looks wrong. So, it's very, we as human again, is very sensitive to that. And it's very difficult to trick us. And you know, everything it also it has to work very efficiently in real time because you cannot have any latency. That's another challenge with augmented reality. The speed should be very, very processing speed should be that's everything, you have to be very efficient. And every jittering, in virtual reality you can cheat. In augmented reality, you cannot really cheat because you see, again, you can see the road. And where it is now, I think most of computer, many, many companies, big companies, they try and do something. And for many years now, it's considered as something that is the next things. But it's still promising, more promising than, you have also Facebook and Google. And I know some rumors about Apple. But no one really makes money of that. So, it's still potential because when you have, and they call it sometimes, they call it like a Superman. Once you have this abilities, even if you don't like it, that's the claim that in the future, even if someone doesn't like it, for example, I see you and I get some information that you cannot know about me, I have some advantage on top of you. I don't really like the approach but in general, that's reality. So, if I have something that with augmented reality, going to get more information than someone without it. And so, one day maybe, if you want to be in and know everything, you'll need augmented reality wherever you like it or not. So, Dotan, I would love to spend the last five minutes or so, talking about where we're headed. Because I am terribly excited and frightened of how our world is going to look in a few dozen years, both in terms of people that are aging and loneliness especially with covid. I mean, it's become very apparent how necessary this technology is. But before that, I would still have to understand a little bit better what is essentially augmented reality today? So, are people really actively working on this? Is this mainstream? And I'm drawing a parallel to autonomous vehicles. I had a great chat with a product manager at one of the leading autonomous vehicles company on this show. And one of the things that she mentioned was that, we had a big surge of technology, we've advanced a lot. And we've reached this like, 95-96% threshold. And now we're realizing that the last 5% is incredibly harder than we thought. And so we're almost there, but we have such a big way to go because that's the big threshold. Is that the same thing with augmented reality? I think yes and no. I think it is yes because if you want something perfect, there's still a lot of things to do to make it work. I think there's a problem with augmented reality is the awkwardness. There's no stable killer applications. Why would people like Google, when they have the Google glasses. Yes, you get more information, but you look awkward. If there's not enough extra information, still people are waiting for this killer application that is not there yet, maybe just games, but it's not enough, just games and entertainment. The technology is really, it's getting there. It's not too far for something that you can use but expensive. So the glasses, like HoloLens, Magic Leap, that's something that costs 2 or $3,000 a piece. That's too much for consumers. So, that's something that has to be solved before people can use it. Because with expensive ones, you have very good results. Very, very good. But if you want something that is much cheaper, 10 times cheaper, then checking is not good enough. But that's the hardware. I mean hardware is getting better, cheaper. The camera is getting cheaper. I think technology, of course, there's more to do improve, but I think we're in the right way. And I get the killer application, why would people do it. In the future, they talking about also lenses instead of glasses. You don't see it but the hardware it's very creepy. I don't know. But I think, I believe that that's something again, like, even if you like it or not, It's going to happen. It's going to happen. Yeah. Because I'm asking this very honestly, because we had such a big hype. And everybody was talking about it. We had Magic Leap that was in stealth mode for so long, raising so much money. and then all of a sudden, you stop really hearing about these advancements. You do have Oculus and HoloLens, but you don't really see me and my friends talking about these technologies as much as we did even five years ago. Which is counterintuitive. Because I would expect that now, we'd be talking about it much more than before. I remember going to conferences and the person with the Google Glass was the most popular person in the room. So, what I'm hearing from you is that I can be optimistic and I should be planning for a nearby future when it will be less awkward and more beneficial to take part in this new humanity. Yes, I think that's the directions. And because, again, there is so much things we can learn and do with that and so much extra information you can get. So, I think, sooner or later, maybe later, but it's going to happen. And again, there's also the prices that are going to drop. I think so many big players out there. And like you said, it was very big hype and some small companies were closed because it's difficult to get some air. Right. But the big companies are still there. And I think it's going to happen. Maybe not as soon as they thought but it's going to happen. So, now is the part that I'm most excited about. Where are we heading? Let's say, 10 years down the line or 20 years down the line, what do you envision our world will look like with augmented reality as part of our society? In a modest expectation. Given the technology that you're expecting to grow, how do you envision humanity operating or at least places like Tel Aviv, Silicon Valley, New York? Okay. So, maybe we have to separate which one what I want and maybe what I think that's going to happen because it's not that I like, Yes, I like the technology. First of all, augmented reality, like I said before, from the technology side, as a developer, from contribution production, integration. Yeah, but I'm not sure that there's a use of it I really like. If I just try to imagine all this creepy situations, I'm not sure I really like to have it in the future. It's also scary for me. But if we just mentioned this corona thing, we sometimes go far from the family being able to, so that's the good thing. So, that's the thing that I really think that are beneficial. Now, everything is virtual. We are in Zoom right now, but I want to make a meeting with you and we want to discuss something that here is on the table, and with AR glasses, we can discuss it. It's already possible with some with more advanced headsets that are too expensive, like I mentioned earlier. But now you can already look at the same object and look at that around it. So, I think for high tech, for many other for professional use, there are a lot of things that you can share and be able to gain a lot of, and safe like Zoom. You don't have to meet to do it. You can do it from home. And like you also mentioned, for the elderly people maybe they can not read because it's too small. But now you can, assuming that you do that in the UI simple enough and intuitive enough, that's also a challenge. Because, we know, If it was computer, we use the mouse and the keyboard, we are already used to it. But with augmented reality, how to use. So, there are a lot of challenges there, the uiPAD. The technology have hand checking and head checking, the eyes checking. None of that was very useful. It worked, but not so. If you want to change, do something like that, to change the screen or do something like that. Hand signs that are not very intuitive. If we solve that, I just mentioned that because we think about old people. So, if you make it intuitive enough and maybe hopefully will find a way to interact with that. So, family that want to meet each others and together with the holograms or things like that, you could really feel like, so, every time it use augmented reality, even more virtual reality. Sometimes I use it and then, I when I'm done, I just take my glasses off and oh, wow, I'm back to the real life. I'm back to the boring world. Yeah. It is so easy to forget about your environment when especially with virtual reality. And that's something that I think that if we find again, like some applications that something that can do a lot of good to people. I'm terribly excited about the prospect of being able to talk with my grandparents from afar. Due to covid, I can't go inside their house and visit them. And it kills me inside. And I'm saying like, why do I need to use video conferencing on Shabbat dinner to wish them Shabbat Shalom. I want to be able to be in the same room with them because it feels to me that were almost there. And it's so relevant today and it's going to continue being so relevant moving forward. And so, I'm incredibly excited about this technology. And one more thing, there's a haptic feedback. That's something that is still missing and that's more expensive. That's part that is a bit behind, because you also want to touch. You want to hug your grandparents, If you could hug them or something, And there are some controllers that just vibrate a bit, but it's not much more than that and the better ones are very expensive. Right. That's something that has to, maybe in 10 to 20 years, I hope that this one will get much, much better because that will make a lot of difference. Right. I just read an interesting review of the new PlayStation game console, which the PlayStation 5, it introduces haptic feedback through the remote controllers so that you're more immersed into the game. And one of the things that they said and I read a few of the gamers designer's decision making process, they said that they intentionally minimized the use of this new feature because they were afraid that humans will not be receptive to it yet. It will be too much for them. So, I'm especially curious, given what we talk here about how we as humanity are going to accept this new reality. And just like you mentioned, that you take off those glasses and you're back into the boring world, or the default world, whatever. Every person experience it differently. I think that's fascinating. Dotan, I want to really thank you for being so generous with your time. I wanted to talk about J-Ventures and some of the work that we do there, but we didn't have time for that. But I'd love to get from you three words that you would use to describe yourself. So, one is very active. So, I always prefer to do something than not to doing something, So, even when I wake up in the morning, I want to go jogging or not, and I am tired, I'm not going to Jjog today. But I remember that, whenever I'm doing something or when I do something I never regret. I love that. Even if you regret I know I'll regret more times about things I didn't do than about something that I want to do. So, whenever I have to think about should I do it or not, my approach is yes, do it. Like a startup, just do it. I love it. That's one thing. And the other thing is just, I think I'm very calm. So, it's very difficult for me to someone to make me angry or mad. It's very difficult to make me mad. Maybe that's why I don't have so much startups, because I'm calm. You seem very fulfilled and calm. And I'm taking a lot of inspiration from that first word, being active and not regretting even when your intuition says maybe this isn't right, but then you rationalize and you say, well, I'm more often than not, I don't regret, I'm enjoying the experience. And so, I think that's really wonderful. Wonderful. Dotan, thank you very, very much. Thank you for being on the show. Thank you for being so generous with your time. And I'll see you around at J-Ventures meetings. Yeah. See you. Bye-bye. Nice to talk to you.
