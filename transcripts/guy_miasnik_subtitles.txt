Okay. Guy Miasnik, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? Very good, Michael. Thank you for having me here. Of course you're good. Look at this view that you're talking from. Where are you now? I am now from my home office. This is covid time. We are all shuttering in place. Well, it's a beautiful beautiful home office. But the view, the view is from Mount Rose in Tahoe. And that's where I was two weeks ago, climbing with my bike up, and so. Climbing with your what? Bike. Bike. I didn't know you can climb with a bike. With the motorcycle. Yeah. When we a have mountains also, but they're in Tahoe. You basically walk up and you climb. Work hard. Play hard. Guy, we have so much to talk about because, the most fascinating thing that as you know, and in preparation for this I asked a simple question. I want to talk about the things you're passionate about. And your different experiences. And I listed like seven things we could talk about, because you were the chief strategy officer of the BlackBerry. And you sold the company for $200 million to BlackBerry, and HBS, and so on. And you mentioned, at the essence of it, you're an entrepreneur. And that is your true passion. Beyond the combination of all of these specific things. Guy, what does it mean to you that you are an entrepreneur? And you've been an entrepreneur for quite some time. So, you pretty have some good in your understanding of what it means to you. That's a great question, Michael. So, entrepreneur is really at the essence. It's in the heart. It's about an impeccable desire to create something that makes an impact. It's about shaping it the way you believe it should be shaped. And it's really being having the passion to work with dedicated and brilliant people. These are, for me, the three things that really make or drive me, and motivates me, in the entrepreneurial world. It's create something. Make an impact, shape it and work with amazing people. And you get that. And you get that and you can make that happen in this kind of the context. When did you become an entrepreneur? What was your turning point? Was it after business school? Before business school? In high school. Okay. So, my first entrepreneurial venture [--] was actually, almost a non profit. I was in high school in Kfar Saba. And there was a boarding school over there for very talented kids that come from a bit of a more difficult background. And somehow I got connected to the head of that boarding school. And I was sort of as a kid and as a high school guy. I knew computers. I was passionate about computers and said, "Listen, I have some amazing, talented kids in my boarding school." "And what can you do?" So, we sat down and I said, "You know what?" "We are going to create a computer class." "Computer school for afternoon activities for your kids." And you did that. When did you do that? This was about six, or about like latter part of 11th grade. 11th grade? Wow. And I recruited a couple of my friends. And we went out and we built the curriculum. And we figured out that we have to purchase some computers for computer [--] from some people who donated the money and we created for them a class and taught it. So, it was my first entrepreneur. Now, it's not a business. It's not a big startup. But it was creating something out of nothing. I made an impact. And I did it with some of my best friends. So, that's entrepreneurship on day one. That's high school and then it just continues from there. I love it. I'm taking so much inspiration. I'm coming from a pretty similar background. I was, I think of myself pretty entrepreneurial back in high school. Especially when it comes to starting a robotics team. Or convincing the administration to have the BC calculus class even though we don't have it. And I think the most inspiring thing is that, after all those years, and after the incredible journeys you've had, you still go back to that high school experience. Which, like you're saying, it's not a startup, it's not a business. But you created value out of thin air, and that is entrepreneurship. Give me in two words this HBS experience. You're at Harvard Business School, one of the top places in the world for entrepreneurship and business, what are those two years like? A life changing. So,  I've been entrepreneur before. I had this one company in Israel. Successful, got acquired. But it was small scale. And the move to HBS into the US open your eyes. Opened my eyes as an Israeli. I'm talking about '97, '98, to a much broader world. A much bigger way of thinking about things. And HBS does it for you. It basically shifts your mind from thinking in your own network cubicle. Okay, the last thing that I heard was life changing. You come in and you're no longer in your own cubicle. And then we froze. That's actually made the point. I mean, that's it. We don't need to continue from that. But really, the point was, I actually had my own little startup in Israel. Which was a smaller scale startup. And the move to the states, the moved to HBS, specifically, opened your eyes. Allows us to really think about much broader issues and much bigger bigger bigger opportunity. So, for me, that was a mega transition coming from the small market of Israel to the bigger world, and to what I think about it in a different way. So, HBS was amazing. And then besides that, it's people. You get a chance to meet some amazing amazing people. Those two things. First of all, I hear life changing, but then I hear that it's both about, understanding scale and meeting incredible people. What is it about these two years that make you transition from thinking small scale nice startup, to, I'm going to go and sell a company for $300 million and become the CSO of BlackBerry. Like, what is that transition? I'm trying to understand. Because obviously, it's one of the dreams of mine to come to get to a place like this. But what is it? So, first of all, no one starts a startup that knows that he's going to sell it for 300 million and becomes CSO of any company. So, it's really about having the confidence to make it different and to go. Okay? Be ready to say, I can do it despite all of those crazy others and crazy reasons, and good reasons actually, not to do anything. And the fact that you have the confidence and in some aspect, the crazy mindset and the extremely optimistic mindset to say, I'm going to do it, this exit. And HBS helps that. HBS actually, as a school gives you the network, gives you the confidence, gives you the way to think about stuff. And I'm not saying it's the only way. There's many ways to get to the kind of I'm on. And I've been that before. But it definitely gave me a great boost. Now, the second thing, my first investor, my second investor, my business partner and my board members, they're all HBS. So, that helps. Okay. So, that's the network side. But to culminate this, for anybody who doesn't get the chance to go to  HBS, or Stanford Business School, summarize, what is the key takeaway that resonated throughout your journey there that you think, this is a lesson that really resonates throughout this experience? Got it. Okay. To really get that, to speak a bit about the experience, entrepreneurial experience that I went through, and it was actually somewhat unique even for the Silicon Valley. If you count from day one to day exit, let's call it, it was from 2000 to 2016 or 15, so, it's about 15 or 16 years, not a common path. Wow. And went to 9/11, that well I should say, from the .com bubble burst in 2000, 9/11, and then later, the financial crisis. So, three mega mega crisis which caused changes, caused pivots and still at the end resulted in actually a very successful company. But it wasn't without a scar and it wasn't without tremendous tremendous amount of work. So, if there was one key lesson, there's a few, but one key lesson is, and that's something you don't know necessarily at HBS. [--] many places in life is if you're not in the game, you can't win. Okay? If you're not in the game, you can't win. So, you need to figure out how do you stay in the game despite everything. Despite whatever is thrown at you, you need to figure out how to stay in the game. And then you need to figure out how to change and adapt as the game and as the landscape change so, you don't get stuck. If you continue to be stuck you would be outside. But if you're in the game, and if you're flexible enough to adjust and pivot, if you don't get panic when the crisis are at you, but actually you seize the opportunity that they provide and you're ready for the long term, you'll get there. I love it. Okay. So, changing the landscapes. You finished HBS. Talked about, you move on to create AtHoc, right? AtHoc and ending up in BlackBerry. Take me through this journey. So, you start a company. All of a sudden you're transitioning. You're in security. And you get to join this great company that previously was a pioneer in mobile. And you were just telling me that that would be a lot of people don't know is that, there is a lot more to BlackBerry than just mobile phones. It's actually, it transitioned into a software company. And actually dealing with also, a lot of automobiles, right? So, the BlackBerry is an amazing story by itself. And we can probably speak about this for a few hours. It's exactly no there. But it's a company that was at its peak. Was at the head of mobile and was leading the world leading mobile devices. And frankly, missed the boat when Apple came in with smartphones. And as a result, collapsed. And stayed in the field mainly, because it had its tremendous amount of money but did not figure out about the people. Until their current CEO came. Which is a way before I joined and decided, Okay, let's pivot this company to become a software business. It is John Chen, right? That's John Chen. And John Chen did a great job in really rescuing the business because the rate it's going, it's going outside. A big part of what he did it was acquisition. He figured out that he needs to bring in talent and assets in order to make a transition of this nature. So, it's the technologies, the customers, the people. And that's why there was a big match with what we brought in. We were a company that was dealing with communication, with government contracts, with the security, with finance, financial services, etc, all of the things that are actually BlackBerry is looking for. And that's how the merge came in. And we basically were acquired and got in. Now, from within, it's a different story. It's a different story because now, you're part of the team. And I was in the executive team over there trying to figure out how to take this new vision, which is not easy. And transition this company from a mobile device with all of these assets that we acquired, these assets, not a company that I'm quite good with technologies and a bunch of smaller companies that were acquired a bit earlier on. And get all of these entities together to speak together and really provide value. And that was one of my task as a CSO, is to figure out and put some directioning on. Now one of the things that was fascinating is, one of these assets was a company called QNX. Which was around secuity for cars. And they provide software that really provides that. And in the world of security, in the world of automated cars and everything that we are seeing in this market, BlackBerry actually has a big play. And another one of the key points of the work that we've done at the time. But still, it's a company in progress. And BlackBerry's still needs to be proven. To prove that it can take that next step. Guy, these are these are things that you really hear about in university in case studies. Companies that are coming. Their market leaders. And all of a sudden they lose their footing. And they have to figure out how to either how to stay in the game. And you got to play the chief strategy officer during that time of learning how to stay in the game and thinking about how to make these acquisitions. What are some of the challenges that you're addressing here? Are there different cultural challenges? Or different adversities that people don't know where we're headed? Because people, I'm guessing, are looking at you and saying, "Hey, you're the chief strategy officer." "What's our strategy?" You're outlining what is the strategy of BlackBerry to stay in the game? So, it's actually quite fascinating to that startup life and turn around life, and in Blackberry it was a turnaround, are actually surprisingly similar. And you will be thinking about turning around a billion dollar business and starting a young company with zero funding is the same. But there's a lot of other similarities in it. One, you need to figure out your story. If you need to figure out your message. And in a turnaround, it's a new message. In the startup, It's a new message. You need to keep focus. It's not easy to keep focus. Okay? Even in a startup, you can lose focus very quickly. In a billion dollar business, you can lose focus even faster. Of course. So, how do you craft your message. How do you focus your business. How do you get your technologies and your people aligned. The alignment of all the people, all of the stakeholders around you. In the startup, it's small. In a billion dollar business, it's many more. Now, just for context about how many people are in the company around this time? How many are we talking here? 5,000, give or take. And it's a public company. So, it's not just the employees. It's the customers. It's the partners. And it's the investors. And you're turning around the strategy for a company of 5,000 employees. It's not just about the company. It's about maintaining alignment. Now, the credit goes to John. He's the CEO. I'm not taking his credit in this respect. But I get to talk to the chief strategy officer now. So, John, thank you very much. But I'm learning from you at this moment. So, you're representing the executive team. But that was a very fascinating process. And again, the similarities with the startup life were fascinating. And that's what the key message in thinking about turnarounds is exactly how to do that and how to deal with such crisis changes. I love it. Okay. So, Guy, two successful endeavors. An executive in a public company, Harvard Business School. You've probably achieved every entrepreneur's dream. Talk to me a little bit about venture capital, Miasnik Ventures. Why venture capital? Why now? What is your source? Why now? Yeah. First of all, it's not a venture capital. Okay? It's a different phase in my life now. I've done three startups. The business startups. Not including the non-business startups. And what I'm still fascinated by is that early stage foundation and incubations of businesses. That's what drives me. Because that's the time where you can shape, you can direct, you can really figure out and create something that is completely new. So, that's what I do right now. I really work with very early stage entrepreneurs. Sometimes, it could be a professor that he has some ideas and wants to figure out how to commercialize it to some class. And other case could be an executive that wants to get out and figure out where to go. Sometimes only an existing team that may have some initial funding and wants to figure out how to take the next step. And I joined them. I joined them in some capacity. Typically, it's a bit of an investment and advisory board position. But it's a very executive position. Meaning, I spend a lot of time. I work, I try to really make sure that they don't make my mistakes. Let them create their own mistakes but don't make my mistakes and learn from that experience. And at the end, I'm looking for, is number one, is amazing people. That's for me, the number one criteria in every one of these decisions and endeavors. And obviously, it needs to be a fascinating market. The field, you want to be in the field, you better enjoy the field [--] I'm always looking for things that have an impact. And have some social impact. And I've been working in public safety. I've been working in security. I've been working in healthcare, education, it's areas where you can actually feel and sense the impact of what you're creating. And also sectors that attract certain types of people. And I'm not talking about necessarily just the founders, but the entire ecosystem around it. Remember that when we, in our talk which was at the end the public safety company and got about 200 people, we had amazing guys. We have people who are ex-militarily, ex-firefighters, people who came from emergency management of counties People that were really living the mission. And that's the passion and the mission is a very crucial part of this. Very very cool. So, you're saying working with entrepreneurs. Working with them as almost joining their team. But when we started the conversation, the first thing you mentioned was that, when you're an entrepreneur, is you are guided by emotions and this urge to do something that doesn't exist. A lot of people say that entrepreneurs have to be crazy. So, it must be frustrating sometimes when you're working with entrepreneurs, you've made the same mistakes they're about to make. You know they're going to make this mistake. But entrepreneurs are guided by emotion sometimes. And I'm sure that sometimes, they don't listen. Sometimes they need to make that mistake. Is that frustrating to you? Or do you say, Okay. I'm going to let them make this mistake? So, you know what? I have three kids. One of them is now 21 years old. He has his own startup. Yeah. And so, when you raise kids, you go through the same thing. You see what they do. You try to give them your best advice and wisdom. And hopefully most of the time, they'll listen. Sometimes they don't listen. Hopefully most of the time you're correct. But sometimes you're not correct as well. So, it's a matter of really the team and the people that you work with. And to find ones that can have a mutual respect. But also, remember something really important. At the end, it's their startup. Okay? It's not you. If you are joining, in this case, it's me. If I'm joining and I'm supporting them. Still supporting them but they are the founders. They are the entrepreneurs. They are the guys that are in the trenches and will go and make that happen. So, we always have to remember that. I love it. I love it. And I'm learning so much through our work together in J-Ventures. And just, I think that your passion for helping entrepreneurs just shines through this. And I look forward to working together much more. And I had a wonderful chat with your son the other day. And I was just so impressed and so taken back that he was really doing incredible things. And now I understand the mentorship that he gets. But Guy, before we leave, I have to ask for three words that you would use to describe yourself. Got it. Okay. You give me a few minutes heads up on this one. But we were speaking throughout. I didn't have too much time to think. So, when I tell you that you have 90 minutes to prepare, it's actually a lie. Because you have to answer me for these 19 minutes. So, I would say, one, is passion. Passion in whatever you do. And enjoy whatever you do. Number two, is persistency. I spoke about it. Just be there. Be there and play the game. Play the game and stay in the game. And number three, it's family. And family is obviously your own immediate family. But family is also the team that you create you build in your startup. And the ecosystem you build around it. And if you treat them as a family, it is the thing, they become your family. And that's the perfect startup. Guy, toda raba. Thank you very very much. Thank you for the time. Thank you for the inspiration. And then I'll see you around in our monthly meetings. Michael, thank you very much. Take care. Bye bye.
