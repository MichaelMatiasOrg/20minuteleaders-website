1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,360
Leadership is about your team,

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,964
and about the people,

3
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:10,280
and about creating constructs and frameworks

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,500
for them to fully realize their vision.

5
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,760
Diane Boettcher, thank you so much

6
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,280
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,040
How are you?

8
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,440
I'm good, thank you.

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,320
Thanks for having me.

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,720
Pleasure to be here.

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,280
Thank you very much for joining me.

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,723
We have so much to talk about

13
00:00:58,923 --> 00:00:59,895
in so little time

14
00:01:00,095 --> 00:01:01,840
because we are going to talk about

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,667
your experience in the military

16
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:05,614
in the technology side,

17
00:01:05,814 --> 00:01:08,086
being deployed overseas to Afghanistan

18
00:01:08,286 --> 00:01:11,080
but transitioning to being a keynote speaker

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,080
and leading with kindness.

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,025
And when I think of

21
00:01:14,225 --> 00:01:15,828
a military setting in Afghanistan,

22
00:01:16,028 --> 00:01:17,719
transitioning to a keynote speaking

23
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:19,000
of leading with kindness,

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,210
there's going to be a little bit,

25
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,440
I'm sure there's a dissonance there.

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,261
But then, being an architect manager

27
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:29,000
at Microsoft, so a lot of experiences

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,280
that I want to learn from.

29
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,551
But I'd like to start

30
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:33,717
with the hardest question, which is

31
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:35,440
tell me a little bit about yourself

32
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,280
and where you come from?

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,766
So, a great question.

34
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:43,935
As you could probably guess from my accent,

35
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:45,366
I am American, although,

36
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:47,003
I used to lived most of my adult life

37
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:49,280
outside of the continental US.

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,240
Some of that due to my military career,

39
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,000
some of it due to my civilian career.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,960
So, yeah, like you said,

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,240
pretty diverse background.

42
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,349
I think of myself,

43
00:01:58,549 --> 00:01:59,890
earlier you've mentioned my title

44
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,040
as an architect manager.

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,240
I think of myself as a leader

46
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,480
more than as a manager.

47
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,167
And we always say that

48
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,960
we manage things and lead people right.

49
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,800
And both need to be that.

50
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,943
Leaders and organizations

51
00:02:11,143 --> 00:02:12,144
need to be paying attention

52
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:12,960
to both sides of that.

53
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,480
Because you always have to manage budgets

54
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,960
and time and resources

55
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,120
and things like that.

56
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:18,694
But people should never be thought of

57
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:21,400
as things and so we lead people.

58
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,800
And so, yeah,

59
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,880
I joined the Navy right out of college.

60
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,560
I went to flight school.

61
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,840
Not a pilot, though.

62
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,985
Most of the time when I say

63
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,880
I flew reconnaissance aircraft,

64
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,400
people go, "Oh, you're a pilot." No.

65
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,360
So, a lot of people have seen Top Gun.

66
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,440
So Maverick and Goose, right? Goose.

67
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,160
I was in the back, we're on a mission,

68
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,500
hovering out, "Do some of that pilot stuff."

69
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,500
Diane, I have to go back a little bit

70
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:53,000
because the thing that I enjoy most

71
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:55,880
about this show is really

72
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,480
understanding the junctions

73
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,440
and the decision making processes.

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,000
Correct me if I'm wrong,

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,505
but it's not the default path

76
00:03:04,705 --> 00:03:06,675
for many young women out of college

77
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,181
to go to flight school in the Navy,

78
00:03:09,381 --> 00:03:13,080
especially in a technological position.

79
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,800
Sure. Sure.

80
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,156
Okay, so, I consider myself

81
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:18,120
one of the first digital natives.

82
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,185
Both of my parents

83
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:20,782
work for a computer company

84
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:22,198
when I was growing up.

85
00:03:22,398 --> 00:03:25,380
And back then computers took up rooms.

86
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,311
And a college might,

87
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:30,080
a college might have one computer.

88
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,520
And in fact, that's what my mother did.

89
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,480
My mother has a background in education

90
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,840
and she sold computers

91
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,800
to engineering school.

92
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
So, they weren't really sure

93
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,600
they needed a computer, right?

94
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,800
They've been teaching engineering

95
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,744
for many years and they weren't sure

96
00:03:42,944 --> 00:03:45,360
they needed a computer to do it.

97
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,849
And the CEO of the company,

98
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:49,439
a man named Mr. Morris, believed computers

99
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,480
were going to change the world

100
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,640
and they belonged to the homes.

101
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,760
And everybody thought that was crazy.

102
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
And they said, "What would they do with it?"

103
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,263
"What would you do

104
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,360
with a computer in your house?"

105
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,800
And he's like, "Well, I don't know."

106
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,480
"So, let's give them to people."

107
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,871
And so he reached out to his employee base

108
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:06,920
and he said, "Who has young children?"

109
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,960
And he gave us mainframe terminal.

110
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,796
So, I was about 10 or 11 years old

111
00:04:10,996 --> 00:04:13,000
and we got a mainframe terminal in my house.

112
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,573
This was an old three hundred baud

113
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:15,920
classical modem.

114
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,560
We were like pounding it into the cradle.

115
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,680
And we did what teenagers do.

116
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,480
We played games and act the voice.

117
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,148
So, I was very early on

118
00:04:28,348 --> 00:04:30,837
exposed to technology,

119
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,440
exposed to that kind of

120
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,440
part of the world, if you will.

121
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,480
And so, when I graduate from college,

122
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,960
I was joining the Navy,

123
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,360
this was late 80's, mid 80's,

124
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,000
very much appreciative of the freedoms

125
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
that we enjoy here in the United States.

126
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,160
Felt it was important

127
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,040
to put my hand at the wheel,

128
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,357
take my turn at the [--], if you will,

129
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:02,120
and join the military, so I did.

130
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,080
And then it was like, well, actually,

131
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,800
at the time women weren't allowed on

132
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,560
to serve on ships.

133
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,120
But there was some interesting things

134
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,440
happening in the aviation side of the house.

135
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,520
And so, that's why I decided to go there.

136
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,292
Wow. Okay.

137
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:21,680
So, and how long did you serve for?

138
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,280
I actually just retired.

139
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,960
Between active duty and reserves

140
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,840
I've served 30 years.

141
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
Wow. 30 years.

142
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,784
So, I have to all of a sudden jump

143
00:05:32,984 --> 00:05:34,640
a little bit, because today,

144
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,840
I'm going to skip for now

145
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,968
about the leading with kindness.

146
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:37,960
We'll come back to this.

147
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,521
But I have to now talk about

148
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:41,280
being a leader at Microsoft,

149
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,960
being a leader in the Navy,

150
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,680
deployed overseas,

151
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,568
managing critical infrastructure

152
00:05:48,768 --> 00:05:50,335
at both companies,

153
00:05:50,535 --> 00:05:52,720
different types of infrastructure, I'm sure,

154
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
and different technologies, I'm sure.

155
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,182
What were some commonalities

156
00:05:56,382 --> 00:05:59,400
and some differences that you're seeing?

157
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,840
Oh, yeah.

158
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,053
So, the couple of places

159
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:07,560
where I was managing infrastructure.

160
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,640
So, in addition to being deployed

161
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,148
to Afghanistan as a civilian,

162
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:14,065
I managed the network in Germany

163
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:16,659
as well as one on the continent of Africa

164
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:18,751
and a little country called Djibouti,

165
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:20,955
which we just have to admit

166
00:06:21,155 --> 00:06:21,920
it's from the side.

167
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,237
So, and I think that one of the things

168
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:31,295
that is common across is that

169
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:36,235
we've really moved from seeing technology

170
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:39,772
as an extra as it was when I was young

171
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:42,560
to being infrastructure, right?

172
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,189
That we can no longer think of technology

173
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:50,081
as Internet access of the capabilities

174
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:54,325
that are brought to us with technology

175
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:56,240
as a nice to have.

176
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,656
They are a must-have.

177
00:06:57,856 --> 00:07:00,752
It's powering the war. It really is.

178
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:02,120
At the same time,

179
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,791
We don't see the,

180
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,720
I don't see the operators, right?

181
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,977
So, whether that's the people

182
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:15,080
who fly the aircraft to pick up the weapons

183
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,200
in the military or in a business context,

184
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,560
would be your sellers,

185
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,600
your customer engagement,

186
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,323
really understanding

187
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:25,520
what's happening with the technology.

188
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,760
And so, as a leader in technology,

189
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,024
a lot of times

190
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:32,010
what we were spending our energy on

191
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,235
is helping those business leaders,

192
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:36,200
helping those operational leaders

193
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,759
understand the capabilities

194
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,560
and the constraints

195
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,920
that the technology brings to it.

196
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,760
So, for example, in the military,

197
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,457
we would often have to talk

198
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:48,280
to some of the senior leaders

199
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,440
about how we had to,

200
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,346
you know we have to take down the servers

201
00:07:52,546 --> 00:07:53,600
and do patched maintenance on them.

202
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,480
So, this was before the cloud

203
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,400
and before virtual machines.

204
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,267
And we would actually have to take,

205
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:03,680
have an outage in order to update

206
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,800
and install the patches on the servers.

207
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,364
And we have to explain

208
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:08,661
to very senior people

209
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:11,800
that we would have to take down the system.

210
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,034
And a lot of times they,

211
00:08:13,234 --> 00:08:14,928
"Why I never have to do that

212
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,320
with my router at home?"

213
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:16,840
"Well, yes, sir."

214
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,402
"That's because your router at home

215
00:08:18,403 --> 00:08:19,160
is your own."

216
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,229
The adversary, probably, is on it.

217
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:23,120
Because you've never patched it.

218
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,434
And we don't want that happening

219
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:26,480
to our servers, so we have to take it down.

220
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,280
And so, then we would try to say,

221
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,240
"Well, you know, you wouldn't fly

222
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,520
an aircraft for 30 days without maintain."

223
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,680
"You wouldn't fire a weapon for 60 days

224
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,000
without taking disassembling it

225
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,880
and cleaning it and maintaining it, right?

226
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,600
"Oh, right."

227
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
"Yeah, okay."

228
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,044
"Well, we have to do that

229
00:08:43,244 --> 00:08:44,200
with the technology as well."

230
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,460
And so a lot of,

231
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,895
both in business and in military,

232
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,334
a lot of what it is,

233
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,760
is helping those business leaders,

234
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,400
helping the operational leaders understand

235
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,920
both the limitations and the capabilities,

236
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,003
what are the cool things they can do

237
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:00,160
with the technology.

238
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,400
I'd love to transition a little bit

239
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,066
in talking about leadership

240
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:06,920
as we continue on your journey.

241
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,400
So, you finished your duty, right?

242
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,704
You're still in reserved duty

243
00:09:12,904 --> 00:09:14,240
but you've finished your active duty.

244
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,881
And you are now trying

245
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:18,202
to be a keynote speaker

246
00:09:18,402 --> 00:09:20,625
and help others understand better

247
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:22,040
leading with kindness.

248
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,760
What does that mean?

249
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,000
So, it's got dual meanings, right?

250
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,612
So, first of all,

251
00:09:28,812 --> 00:09:31,160
it's being about being a kind leader, right?

252
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:34,880
It's about leading isn't about yelling.

253
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,295
Leading isn't about

254
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:37,760
the being the one in charge.

255
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,360
Leading is about being kind.

256
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,549
It's also a little bit of a double standard

257
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,280
that when you lead with something,

258
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,800
it's the thing that comes first, right?

259
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,120
So, it's showing up first with kindness.

260
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,520
Like whatever else comes along,

261
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,960
the kindness needs to show first.

262
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,040
And I think a lot of people misunderstand

263
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,167
the way the military leads.

264
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,332
You've served,

265
00:10:03,532 --> 00:10:06,353
the other people who've served understand that

266
00:10:06,553 --> 00:10:08,920
it's not just about yelling orders,

267
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,123
it's about helping people share the vision.

268
00:10:12,323 --> 00:10:14,320
Like understand what are we doing here,

269
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,360
what are we trying to accomplish.

270
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,280
And then getting other people's way

271
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,120
and letting their creativity,

272
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,520
their passion, their innovation,

273
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,080
their energy make that vision come true.

274
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,680
And you can't do that

275
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,729
if people don't share the vision

276
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:34,400
and they're not going to share

277
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,029
the vision with you

278
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,360
if you're mean to them.

279
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,800
It's just as simple as that.

280
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,720
Why so passionate about this?

281
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,195
Where does this innate passion

282
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,080
that you're saying

283
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,662
I want to dedicate myself now

284
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,280
to sharing this passion with others,

285
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,520
where does this come from?

286
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,898
I think well, I think our world lacks leaders,

287
00:10:58,098 --> 00:10:59,840
and I think our world lacks

288
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,280
the good examples of leaders.

289
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,265
I think too many people learn about

290
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:06,477
what it's like to be a leader

291
00:11:06,677 --> 00:11:09,639
through the media, through Hollywood,

292
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,120
through fictional depictions.

293
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,120
And a fictional depiction of

294
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,464
Eisenhower standing with those paratroopers

295
00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:21,647
the night before D-Day

296
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,080
and just talking with them.

297
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,520
That's not dramatic, right?

298
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,960
That doesn't sell tickets, right?

299
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,682
So, we end up with the cake box boss

300
00:11:32,882 --> 00:11:34,440
yelling at people.

301
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,437
And we end up thinking that

302
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:38,360
that's what leadership is.

303
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,920
And it's not.

304
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,440
It's not.

305
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,760
But the quiet, humble leaders

306
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,040
who are out there doing the hard work

307
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,600
of getting to know their people

308
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,920
and helping their people,

309
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,360
lifting their people up,

310
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,560
we don't see that portrayed.

311
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,771
So, we have this misunderstanding

312
00:11:56,971 --> 00:11:59,640
of what it means to lead and be a leader.

313
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,560
And I think we lack that in our communities,

314
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,120
we lack that in our schools,

315
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,240
we lack that in our workplaces.

316
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,600
And it doesn't have to be like that.

317
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,520
Work doesn't have to be terrible.

318
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,480
We spend so much of our day at work.

319
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,880
Why would we want it to be a turmoil?

320
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,280
Why would we want it to be so difficult?

321
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,480
Why can't it be?

322
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,320
And I think it can.

323
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,583
I think it can be a place

324
00:12:27,783 --> 00:12:28,806
where we grow and we thrive

325
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:30,000
and we bring our full,

326
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:32,040
and complete authentic selves.

327
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,280
So, where does that come from?

328
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,108
This comes from a look

329
00:12:35,308 --> 00:12:37,480
that could be so much better.

330
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,706
We could have some fun at work.

331
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:42,077
We could accomplish so much.

332
00:12:42,277 --> 00:12:43,240
We can all win.

333
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,520
Life isn't a competition, right?

334
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,280
I am a gamer too.

335
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,040
That's not in my bio

336
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,320
but I play games all the time with my kids

337
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,400
and everything.

338
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,440
And we play co-op games.

339
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,137
And a co-op game is a game

340
00:12:57,337 --> 00:12:59,189
where we all work together

341
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:00,400
to beat the game,

342
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,680
not to beat each other.

343
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,760
And that's what life is.

344
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:04,240
Life's a co-op game.

345
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,400
We can all win.

346
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:09,880
Right. Diane, as I'm embarking

347
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,480
on my journey,

348
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,360
and I hope to have the privilege

349
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,360
of leading great teams

350
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,760
with fantastic, motivated,

351
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,600
intelligent, hardworking people,

352
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,811
what are some things

353
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:23,760
that I can take with me from this conversation

354
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,385
for the next few decades

355
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,720
as hopefully a successful leader?

356
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,520
What things should I be keeping in mind

357
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,837
that you're observing that are just

358
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:35,800
not apparently enough in the world?

359
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,680
So, leadership isn't about you.

360
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,200
Leadership is about your team,

361
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,832
and about the people,

362
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:54,120
and about creating constructs and frameworks

363
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:00,560
for them to fully realize their vision.

364
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,320
And as the leader, what you do is

365
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,640
you set the overall larger vision

366
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,400
and then you help people understand

367
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,160
how they can achieve their purpose

368
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,513
In that context.

369
00:14:14,713 --> 00:14:18,800
And then, when I said create the frameworks

370
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,840
that allows them to have those

371
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,880
to bring their passion,

372
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,329
their innovation, their creativity, right?

373
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:27,810
Because those are the things

374
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:28,680
you can't automate.

375
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,200
Those are the things, you know,

376
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,600
if it's something where,

377
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,248
I always hear from my people,

378
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:36,560
it's, "Well, tell me what to do."

379
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,960
I said, "Well, I could do that,

380
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,880
I would write an algorithm."

381
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,760
And I would just have the algorithm do it.

382
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,280
What I need from you is

383
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,320
to figure out what I don't know, right?

384
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,640
So, listen to your people.

385
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,572
Understand that they're full

386
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:53,440
and complete human beings right there,

387
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,800
more than what they bring to work.

388
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,154
And so, understand what those

389
00:14:58,354 --> 00:14:59,598
other things are about them

390
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,174
and what's important to them

391
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:02,931
and support them in that.

392
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:04,800
And then share your vision

393
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,840
and clearly communicate your vision

394
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,240
over and over and over and over again.

395
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:13,160
The best leaders are those whose people

396
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,920
can imitate them flawlessly.

397
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,232
If your people

398
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:21,360
can do a good imitation of you,

399
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,800
it means you're showing up,

400
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,800
it means you're being consistent, right?

401
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,404
I love that. I love that.

402
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:29,366
Because, you know,

403
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:31,408
a lot of the people that I speak to,

404
00:15:31,608 --> 00:15:32,779
I ask this question a lot

405
00:15:32,979 --> 00:15:34,353
and a lot of the times

406
00:15:34,553 --> 00:15:36,040
I'm hearing responses like,

407
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,720
a good leader is one that knows

408
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,417
how to hire slow and fire fast.

409
00:15:40,617 --> 00:15:42,232
Or a good leader is one that knows

410
00:15:42,432 --> 00:15:43,838
how to articulate the vision

411
00:15:44,038 --> 00:15:45,836
and take the team forward.

412
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:47,530
Rarely, the first response is

413
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,781
a good leader is one who listens

414
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:51,640
and one who serves by example

415
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,634
and has their people yearning to

416
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:57,760
or able to imitate their positive qualities,

417
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,680
like showing up and being consistent.

418
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,160
So, I'm taking a lot of this inspiration.

419
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,238
And I have to say that

420
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:05,962
from my experience in the military,

421
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:07,252
I've gotten to observe

422
00:16:07,452 --> 00:16:08,640
great leaders, poor leaders.

423
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,240
I've gotten to be a leader myself.

424
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,520
I have been a good leader.

425
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,840
I have been a poor leader.

426
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,120
And I've learned from both.

427
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,335
And it's a journey that I'm very excited

428
00:16:17,535 --> 00:16:18,720
to continue embarking on.

429
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,760
And in the end people is everything.

430
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,120
We just have a few minutes left.

431
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,920
But I'd love to learn a little bit about

432
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,200
what you're doing today at Microsoft,

433
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,040
what you chose as your next challenge.

434
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,577
And then obviously, the last was

435
00:16:31,777 --> 00:16:34,200
a difficult question that I'll ask,

436
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,200
Okay. Yes, I was an architect manager.

437
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,475
I lead a small team of pretty senior folks,

438
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:43,960
which is really exciting.

439
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,990
All of them have 15, 20 years

440
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,600
of industry experience.

441
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,040
And what they do is they help our customers

442
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,480
who are solving the hardest problems

443
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,280
with our technology.

444
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,280
So, whether it's typically we're talking

445
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,875
Fortune 50 type of customers

446
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:06,119
who are doing big things or new things

447
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,872
with our technologies

448
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:09,706
and the architects in my team

449
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:10,720
help them do that.

450
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,320
And so that what my job is,

451
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,580
is to make sure that

452
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,033
they have everything they need

453
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:19,918
to show up well for our customers

454
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:22,440
and help our customers succeed.

455
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,320
So, it sounds like an amazing challenge

456
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,720
that consistently changes,

457
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,840
consistently having to adapt,

458
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,967
because obviously we're seeing

459
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,211
how the world is changing every single day.

460
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,363
And Microsoft is at the forefront

461
00:17:34,563 --> 00:17:35,400
of these changes.

462
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,954
And I'm sure that

463
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:39,000
it's a pretty remarkable position.

464
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,320
Diane, I want to thank you again

465
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,840
for being so generous with your time.

466
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,097
And I'd love to end with my favorite question,

467
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,444
which is three words that you would use

468
00:17:46,644 --> 00:17:47,600
to describe yourself.

469
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,280
Yeah. So I'm candid.

470
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,173
To all of my friends I'm candid.

471
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,360
I'm founded in knowledge.

472
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,080
I like to do my homework.

473
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,200
And then the last is compassion.

474
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,600
I can definitely see that.

475
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,012
Yeah.

476
00:18:04,212 --> 00:18:05,000
I love that.

477
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,520
And I want to, again,

478
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,400
thank you for sharing your journey.

479
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,964
I think it's remarkable

480
00:18:10,164 --> 00:18:12,120
and I'm learning so much from every journey.

481
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,303
But that transition from the military setting,

482
00:18:15,503 --> 00:18:17,240
the technological background

483
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,569
going there with a mission,

484
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:20,891
being a part of missions,

485
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:22,518
and then going and talking

486
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:24,000
about leading with kindness

487
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,070
and expressing that side

488
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,840
and then doing it in a place like Microsoft,

489
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,400
I'm sure that's just phenomenal.

490
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,797
And I'm sure that those architects

491
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,742
are lucky to have you working with them.

492
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:35,800
So, Diane, thank you very very much.

493
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
And stay safe and stay healthy.

494
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,582
Thank you, you too.

495
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:41,000
All right, thanks.
