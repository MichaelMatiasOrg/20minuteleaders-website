1
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,940
All right. Itai Pinki!

2
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,940
Thank you so much for joining me
on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,940
Thank you for having me.

4
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,900
You know, just five minutes ago,
you sent me, on WhatsApp,

5
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,900
pictures of us from 11 years ago
in my bar mitzvah.

6
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,000
I still remember that day,
I'll never forget it,

7
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
the day that you came to my house
so that we can discuss

8
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,900
the bar mitzvah plan.
And half an hour through,

9
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,900
you had my watch on your wrist.

10
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,900
And I'll never forget that moment

11
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,900
that my mind is
just out of this world.

12
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,900
I think you traumatized me really.

13
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,900
I think that's what happened.

14
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,900
If you're being traumatized,

15
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,900
then you invite people
to your you know podcast, that's weird.

16
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,900
[laughs]
Definitely, definitely.

17
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,900
No, but seriously,

18
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,900
I think magic is just
so incredibly powerful;

19
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,900
that sensation that it gives people

20
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,900
and the impact
that it leaves on people.

21
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,900
Talk to me a little bit
about what you do.

22
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,900
You're one of the most
incredible magicians in Israel.

23
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,900
Talk to me about that.

24
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,900
Thank you, first of all.

25
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,900
I think you said it by yourself.

26
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,900
I think magic is the only art form
that creates a unique sensation.

27
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,900
I think like, For instance,
when you see a juggler

28
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,900
juggling 10 knives
or an acrobat doing crazy stuff

29
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,900
with, I don't know what,

30
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,900
you say,
"Oh, my god, that's amazing,"

31
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,900
you applaud;
you respect them

32
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,900
for their practice
and for their art.

33
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,900
When you see a magic,
a good magic trick

34
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,900
or a magic show,

35
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,900
you ask how.

36
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,900
This is the only art form

37
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,900
that creates this kind
of question, saying,

38
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,900
"How does he do it?"

39
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,000
You know it makes this in your brain.

40
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,800
Yeah.

41
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,900
This is why magic is happening
and still happening for years.

42
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:04,000
Because human beings love
to be you know intrigued and say, "How?"

43
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yes.

44
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,500
Because you know,
we're intelligent people.

45
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,900
We know how things work.

46
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,500
When you become an adult,
you understand life.

47
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Then comes someone,
and like this.

48
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,000
[snaps fingers]

49
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,500
makes your watch disappear,

50
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,000
like you say, "Oh, my god,
I'm intelligent.

51
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,900
How did you do it
without me noticing?"

52
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,900
- So I think --
-Right.

53
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,900
[crosstalk]

54
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,900
Walk me a little bit
back in your life

55
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,900
because I have to know
how do you even get started

56
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,900
as a magician.

57
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,900
How do you discover
this innate passion of yours

58
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,900
to amaze and intrigue people?

59
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,900
I don't know who said it.

60
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,300
One of the greatest
painters in the world.

61
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:49,900
He said, "A painter is a kid that
just continued with his doodling."

62
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,900
Every kid does this
when he's a kid.

63
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,900
And then, you become
a painter, a famous painter,

64
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,900
an artist when
you become an adult.

65
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,900
- Not all of us.
- Right.

66
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
A lot of people
can play the piano.

67
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,900
Not everyone becomes Beethoven.

68
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,000
So mgic is the same.

69
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,500
I think most of the kids,

70
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,900
I think mainly boys,
get like magic kits,

71
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,900
or magical book
or something like this,

72
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,900
and they play with it
like for 10 minutes or a week,

73
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,900
and then they stop.

74
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,900
I know you're more than that
because you love magic,

75
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,900
but most of the kids
are like doing it for a week

76
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,900
or a few days.

77
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,900
And then, they continue playing
basketball or whatever it is,

78
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,500
-their other hobbies.
-Right.

79
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,900
I think a magician is just a kid
that continued.

80
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,000
He just loved it
and did it more and more

81
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,900
from this because --

82
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,900
Like every time we did
the magic trick for someone --

83
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,900
I began magic when I was 15-ish

84
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,900
and left it,
and left it and continued with my sports.

85
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,900
And at the age of like 19,
give or take,

86
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,900
I came back to this
like my passion.

87
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,900
My kids --

88
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,900
as a kid,

89
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,900
my passion when I was a kid.

90
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,900
And every person
I showed him a magic trick told me,

91
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,900
"Okay, can I have your
business card?"

92
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,000
And I was like,
"What business card?

93
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is a hobby, man.
I'm just doing this

94
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,900
to hit on girls."

95
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,900
And people told me,

96
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,900
"But this is like you can
make a living out of this,"

97
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,500
like, "I need your business card.
I have an event," or whatever.

98
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,000
And when you hear it,
once you say,

99
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,500
"Okay, that's a great compliment."

100
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,000
When you hear it
like 15 times a day,

101
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,900
you say, "I think I should
make a living out of this."

102
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,000
So that was 19 years old
when you decided to go to go

103
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,900
from a hobby to actually becoming
a full-time magician?

104
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,900
As a profession?

105
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,900
Yeah, I think when I'm like 20,
I already like you know got booked

106
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,900
for serious events.

107
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,500
-Incredible!

108
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,900
Not huge conferences,

109
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,900
but it was like I got paid
already for my gigs.

110
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,900
Right. So now, Itai,
you're a little bit different

111
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,900
in the field in the sense
that you're not just going

112
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,900
and doing street magic
in bar mitzvahs

113
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,900
and weddings, and so on,
but you do huge conferences

114
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,900
and you're doing a show,
and you call it stand-up magic.

115
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,900
-Yeah.
-I'd love for you to tell me

116
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,900
a little bit about this
combination of stand-up

117
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,900
and magic and how do these
two intertwine with each other.

118
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,900
Yeah, so first of all,
the combination is,

119
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,900
as you said, stand-up magic,
you can understand by the name.

120
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,900
It combines stand-up
comedy and magic.

121
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,900
The combination, I think,

122
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,900
is natural, because most of the
magicians use comedy

123
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,900
or try to be funny, at least.

124
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,900
I don't know
whether they're all funny

125
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,900
but they try.

126
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,900
They use gags and comedy bits.

127
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,900
And stand-up comedy
is being funny.

128
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,900
The art form is very similar.

129
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,900
The crowd,
the target audience is the same.

130
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,900
Stand-up comedy and magic,

131
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,900
it's entertainment.

132
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,500
Sure.

133
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,900
It's not like combining
ballet dancing

134
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,900
with stand-up comedy
or you know opera with magic.

135
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,900
But it's still forces you
to be creative enough

136
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:59,000
to create a show that has
both the elements of jokes

137
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
--  and entertainment
--  Yeah.

138
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,900
on the set of comic,
but also the magician's wow factor.

139
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,500
Yeah, actually, it's much more
than just comedy and jokes.

140
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,900
It's literally I needed to begin
a new art from the beginning

141
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,900
to being a stand-up comedian.

142
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,900
For the crowd, it's okay,
it's like the same,

143
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,900
"He's very funny.
He uses very good jokes."

144
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,900
It's not like a joke or two.

145
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
In my show, I have
like a set of 10 minutes

146
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,900
with the mic, just to set
the comedy set

147
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,900
like Brock, we call it.

148
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,900
Just the comedy set
in the middle of the magic tricks.

149
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:34,900
So it was literally like
teaching myself a new art form

150
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,900
from the beginning.

151
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,300
So it was difficult for me.

152
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,000
For the crowd, it's like,
"He's very funny."

153
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
They don't know
the difference, I think.

154
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Actually, a week ago,
I spoke with someone

155
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
that's on my show,
and she told me,

156
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
"I love the act,

157
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,500
and you know what?
Your magic tricks,

158
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,900
they were good also.

159
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
They're amazing."

160
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,900
I've been doing this for 15 years,
of course, they were good.

161
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,900
[laughter]

162
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,900
But she perceived my show
as a stand-up comedian

163
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,900
using magic tricks.

164
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,900
And I think that the main,
actually, issue with my show is

165
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,900
whether one comes to see the act

166
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,900
when he thinks it's a magic show

167
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,900
or a stand-up comedy show,

168
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,900
because if he thinks
it's a magic show,

169
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,900
it will be damn funny.

170
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,900
And if he thinks
it's just a stand-up comedy,

171
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,900
it will be very surprising.

172
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,900
I love it.

173
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
- That's the thing, Yeah.
- I love it.

174
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,000
Now, Itai,
you're not just a magician.

175
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,500
You're also, actually,
an entrepreneur,

176
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,900
and I had the pleasure of
coming to one of your

177
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,900
Sorcerer's Sundays

178
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,900
in Tel Aviv, which was
one of the most incredible

179
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,900
night out experiences I've had.

180
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,900
Tell me a little bit
about this project.

181
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,000
You actually do it with
lot of your magician friends

182
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,900
or you just amaze people
every Sunday at a restaurant.

183
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,900
Yeah.

184
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,000
Actually, it's a weekly show,

185
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,500
the longest weekly show in Israel.

186
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
-  Wow!
-  Like we've been running

187
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,000
for six and a half years
prior to the COVID-19, of course.

188
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,000
- Right.

189
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,500
Actually, yeah,
the format is a dinner show.

190
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,500
And the idea was founded
about the principle of

191
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,500
there isn't a dinner show
in Israel,

192
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,500
and there isn't
a good entertainment in English

193
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
In Israel.

194
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Like if you have friends
or family from abroad,

195
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,500
people come to Israel.

196
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,500
They can take them to the cinema
or to you know a restaurant,

197
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
and it's not entertainment
in English.

198
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,500
- And I think every city
- Right.

199
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
in the world, it's the same.

200
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,900
When I was in Argentina,
I went to see a tango dinner show;

201
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,900
or in Spain, flamenco,
or the opposites.

202
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,900
Flamenco, it's in Spain,
I think, yeah.

203
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,000
So every city,
a big city,

204
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,900
tourist city,
there is this dinner show,

205
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
show entertainment, whatever,
and it's almost always

206
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,900
in the language of the city,
of the country.

207
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,900
- Sure.
- And Israel is the same.

208
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,900
When you come to Israel,
there isn't anything in English.

209
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,900
So, we this is how we began
thinking about this.

210
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,900
We said, "Okay, we're going
to do a dinner show in English

211
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,900
entertainment for English
speakers with magic,

212
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,900
because magic is cool
and everyone loves magic."

213
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,900
It's for adults, of course.

214
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,900
- Yeah.
- And the cool part is that

215
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,900
every show, every week,
the show differs.

216
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,900
- Right.
- It's like -- it changes.

217
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,900
Yeah, we have like 10,
15 magicians,

218
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,900
all speaking English fluent.

219
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,900
And like for instance, we have
four magicians this day,

220
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,900
and someone comes back
after three months

221
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,000
with his sister that came
from South Africa, or whatever,

222
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,400
they see a new act,

223
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,000
because there are four
new magicians.

224
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So people see the show
over and over again.

225
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,900
We have people coming
like 10 times,

226
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,900
and like 12 times
That's cool.

227
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,900
No and it's not just that the show
on stage is different,

228
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,900
but it's also the interaction
with the people.

229
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,900
I mean, the magicians go
around the tables

230
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,900
and they come up to you,
and you really get

231
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,900
- that whole that whole vibe, which is
- Experience.

232
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
Yeah.
The whole experience

233
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,900
it's incredible.
So Itai, I have to ask,

234
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,900
we're doing this over Zoom.
Now, ideally,

235
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,900
we would be face-to-face
in Israel.

236
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,900
But with COVID,
you're still doing shows

237
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,900
and you're still
entertaining people,

238
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,900
and you're still doing conferences.

239
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,900
- Yes.
- How do you do that

240
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,900
during COVID times?

241
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,900
How do you do magic
over a computer screen?

242
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,900
So in the beginning, it was like,

243
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,900
"Okay, we'll just wait
for this to pass,

244
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,900
and we'll go back to our lives."

245
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
And then we were like,

246
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,900
"Okay, it takes more time
than we expected."

247
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,900
Yeah. [laughs]

248
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,000
That's I think
all of the world thinks like me,

249
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,900
and it's like,
"Okay, it's a thing."

250
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,900
[laughs]

251
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,900
So, actually,
I thought about you know Zoom.

252
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
I said, "Okay,
I'm going to do shows on Zoom,"

253
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
it's very different because
I don't have the crowd,

254
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,900
the interaction,
and bringing people on stage,

255
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,900
and hearing the laughs.
And then I said to myself,

256
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,900
"Myself, it's not the same thing.

257
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,900
- So, don't think about it as --"
- Don't force it.

258
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, you can't wait for the crowd
to applaud and say,

259
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,900
"Okay, you can't just do your show

260
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,900
and expect it to be
the same in Zoom."

261
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,900
No, it's not the same
and it will not be the same.

262
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,000
You need to adapt yourself
and adapt the show for Zoom,

263
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
like the last time we did a show,
and I want to do some jokes.

264
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,900
Okay, so I did my bits
and I put everyone on silent

265
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,900
because I need them to hear me,

266
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,900
instead of them hearing people
in the house, and whatever.

267
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,900
Right, right.

268
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
So I can't hear the laughs.
I can see them laughing

269
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900
but it's silent.

270
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,900
It's like a bad comedy club
―it's silence.

271
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,900
You hear only the crickets
from outside.

272
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,900
I'd do a gag,
and that was my mother.

273
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,900
And then I'd hear...
[imitating cricket sound]

274
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,900
Wow.

275
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,900
And I can see them laughing.
So they're having fun

276
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
and they enjoyed it,
but it's difficult.

277
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,900
It's different.
That's what it is.

278
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,900
Can you get it --?

279
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,900
Can you get the magic across?
That astonishment?

280
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,900
You know, sometimes people,
when you flip a bottle

281
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,900
and you showed that it's empty now,
people want to go and see it

282
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,900
and they want to put their hand
under it to see that

283
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
it's really in the air.

284
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,900
Now, they can't do that, right?
Because now, it's all virtual.

285
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,900
Yes, they can't physically wise,
but I think --

286
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
Actually,
Actually it's a philosophical discussion,

287
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,900
because I think the magician --
the people, the skeptic, they say,

288
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,900
"Yeah, you know, I hate magic.
I want to figure out the tricks.

289
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
The only thing I want
is to figure out the tricks."

290
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,900
I think this person
isn't problematic.

291
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,900
I think the problem is
with the magician performing.

292
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,900
I think that if the magician --
like magic,

293
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,900
when you think about it,
it's very, very condescending.

294
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,900
I think Seinfeld said
it the best.

295
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,900
Seinfeld said,
"A magic show goes like this.

296
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,900
Here's the coin,
now it's gone.

297
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,900
You're stupid."

298
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,900
[laughs]

299
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:40,900
This is exactly like what
most magicians do.

300
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,900
They make you feel stupid.

301
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,900
And I think it's a problem.

302
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,900
I think when you're condescending,
and you're being, you know --

303
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,900
How do you say it? Patronizing?

304
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,900
- You know,
- Yeah.

305
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,900
on your audience's expense,

306
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,900
- it's a problem.
- Yeah.

307
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,000
They feel stupid.

308
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,900
When they feel stupid, they want
to figure out the tricks.

309
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,900
I can see --
All the time,  I see my colleagues

310
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,000
going on TV,
and their first phrase is,

311
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
"Okay. Today,
I brought something

312
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
that will blow your mind.

313
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,900
I'm going to fool you today."

314
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,900
Why?

315
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,000
I think magic isn't a  competition
like me against you.

316
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
If you figure out the trick,
you won.

317
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,900
If I fooled you, I win.

318
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,900
- This is not a game.
- Right.

319
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,900
This is not like basketball,
a winner and a loser.

320
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,900
I think we're both
on the same side.

321
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,900
We're having fun.

322
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,900
I'm here to entertain you,

323
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,900
-  and you're here to have fun.
-  I love it.

324
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,900
Let's do it together.

325
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,000
- I love it.
- And I think the crowd feels it.

326
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,900
When they get this feel,
this vibe, they don't want

327
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,900
to figure out the tricks,

328
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
like in the beginning of my show,
I'd do a comedy bit

329
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,900
just about this,
about, you know,

330
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,900
the people trying to figure out
the tricks and whatever.

331
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,900
And the subtext is "Don't."

332
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,900
Not because I want to fool you.
I will fool you.

333
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,900
This is not the idea.
This is not my mission.

334
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,900
I love it. No, I mean,
you're so approachable on stage

335
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,900
and your show is
mainly for adults, right?

336
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,000
From what I remember correctly
with some of the jokes,

337
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,900
but really,
I mean I've seen

338
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,900
quite a few magic shows,
because I'm a huge

339
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,900
magic fan myself.

340
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,900
And your show
is one of the most one of the most

341
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,900
that I enjoyed the most
because you're so approachable

342
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,900
and because you just make it
such a unique experience

343
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,900
as a friend,
and it's not as "I'm up here.

344
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,900
You're down in the audience.
Now, just get ready to be fooled,

345
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,900
- then good luck figuring it out."
- Yeah.

346
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,900
Itai, I have to ask.

347
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,900
We're here over Zoom.

348
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,900
Can you show me something
and give me the experience

349
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,900
of what it's like
to be in a magic show

350
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,900
in COVID19 times?

351
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,900
I can try. I can try.

352
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,900
Let's do this.

353
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,900
Can you see the clip?

354
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,900
Yes, I can.

355
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,900
All right.

356
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,900
Let's put it here.

357
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm good.

358
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I want you to think of --

359
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
- I will --
- [laughs]

360
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
- [laughs]
- magically place it on the floor.

361
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,500
[laughs]

362
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,000
Nailed it. No? Not yet?

363
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Wait a second.
I have to do this.

364
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You know what?
I'll do this and this.

365
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Opa

366
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,900
- All right.
- Nailed it.

367
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,900
[laughs]
So I want you to think of any

368
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,900
three-digit number

369
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,900
Okay, got it.

370
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,900
No, don't go with 333
because that's very obvious.

371
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,900
Shoot. Okay, now --
Okay. I have a new one

372
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,900
You're good?

373
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,900
Yeah.

374
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,900
You can say it, what is it?

375
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,900
Six-eight-nine.

376
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,900
Four hundred and fifty-nine, yes?

377
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,900
I'll go with six in the beginning,
six-eight-nine.

378
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,900
I have hearing problems.
So let's go with my number, okay?

379
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,900
[laughs] Sound good, sound good.

380
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,000
I'll do it as clear as possible.

381
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You said 689.

382
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,940
I don't know --
wait, wait, what --

383
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:15,900
That's a note drop,
like a mic drop.

384
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,900
Itai, what the F?

385
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,900
- What the hell was that?
- Magic.

386
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,900
No way.

387
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,900
Okay, I did not --

388
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,900
Now, your viewers will think,
"Yeah, they planned this."

389
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,900
[crosstalk]

390
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,900
"He's playing along."

391
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,900
This is what --

392
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,900
Okay, you know,
this was maybe one of the simplest

393
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,900
but most impressive things
I've ever seen.

394
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,900
[laughs]

395
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,900
I don't think I can continue
to do this interview right now.

396
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,900
I'm a little bit shook.

397
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,900
[laughs]

398
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,900
And I was thinking
of 2-8-9 in the beginning,

399
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,900
and I was like, "You know,
no, I'll change it to 6-8-9."

400
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,900
Yeah, I know, I know.

401
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,900
Okay, that was just crazy.
Okay, let's just move on

402
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,900
and then I'll go.

403
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,900
I'm not going to sleep tonight.

404
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,900
This is just crazy.

405
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,900
Itai, humanity is changing.

406
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,500
Things are becoming
more technological.

407
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,400
People are becoming impatient.

408
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,900
People's standards are rising.

409
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,900
Because of technology,
all the immediate gratification --

410
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,900
What is happening
to the magic industry?

411
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,900
Ans you know because it seems that magic today

412
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,900
is still pretty similar
to what it was

413
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,900
when Houdini was alive.

414
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,900
But now, things are becoming
more technological.

415
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,900
I don't know anything.
So maybe you can correct me.

416
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,900
Where are we headed with this?

417
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,900
I don't know where are we heading,
but things do change.

418
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,900
Humanity change.
Technology change.

419
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,900
Yeah, things change
and magic correlates.

420
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,900
Magic changes also, you know?

421
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,900
It's not Houdini, actually.

422
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,900
One of the first magicians
that made magic as a theatrical,

423
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,900
like prestigious thing.

424
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,900
He wore a suit and everything,
was Robert-Houdin.

425
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,900
It's not Houdini.
Houdini did escapolgy.

426
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,900
Robert Houdin did
big boxes and doves,

427
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
and then the grand
illusions with that,

428
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,900
sawing a woman in half,
and then -- whatever.

429
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,900
- Yeah.
- This was in the 50s,

430
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,900
and 60s, and 70s.

431
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,900
In the 80s,
we had Uri Geller,

432
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,900
you know, reading minds.

433
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,900
Things change.
And nowadays, .

434
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,900
people aren't that naive
So they don't want you

435
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,900
to read their minds.
So, the story changed.

436
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,900
Nowadays, it's more like
a psychological mentalism.

437
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,900
Derren Brown in England,
he began all these --

438
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Yeah.

439
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,900
This thing is about --

440
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,900
you know, "I influenced you,
and I read your body language."

441
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,900
Right.

442
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,900
So things change.
You can't say magic is the same

443
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,900
because magic isn't,
nowadays, sawing a woman in half.

444
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,500
Right.

445
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,900
There are magicians
that still do it,

446
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,900
but they can't make a living,
I guess.

447
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,900
They're stuck in the 80s.

448
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,900
Yeah. And so,
how does technology fit into this?

449
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,900
Technology do fit into this.

450
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,000
With technology,
we have new magic tricks.

451
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,900
We have Marco Tempest
doing stuff with iPads,

452
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,900
and we have very visual stuff,
and things do change.

453
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,000
Things change.
Like fifteen years ago,

454
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,900
we had David Blaine
doing magic tricks in the street,

455
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,900
- you know, street magic?
- Yeah.

456
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,900
And he understood
people are more interested

457
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,900
about the reactions.
So David Blaine,

458
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,900
what he did, not only the tricks,
but instead of putting

459
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,900
the camera on the magician,
they pivot

460
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,900
and they showed the reaction.

461
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,900
He did a small trick,
and they had the crowd

462
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,000
yelling for one minute.

463
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,500
So that was Blaine.

464
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,500
And then we have Dynamo,
and whatever.

465
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
Nowadays,
we have Instagram magicians.

466
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,500
No presentations,
no nothing,

467
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,500
no patience for the viewer.
People just see a trick,

468
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,500
five seconds, bam, bam, bam,
and it's done.

469
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,500
So I think this is
the way things change.

470
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
I don't know whether
it's just the technology,

471
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,500
but it's the medium.

472
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Like nowadays,
with the Zoom.

473
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Yes.
So fast.

474
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
- Things change.
- Definitely.

475
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
Itai, I can't believe it,
I said that 20 minutes

476
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,500
are going to go away
so quickly, and they have.

477
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
- Unbelievable.
- Already?

478
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
I have to put you
on the spot once,

479
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,500
and I didn't prepare you for this.
So I'm sorry in advance. But --

480
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,500
- Okay.
- I want you to tell me three words

481
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
that you would best
describe yourself as,

482
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,500
or if I ask anybody
watching your show,

483
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,500
when I think of Itai Pinki,

484
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,900
what are three words
that I think of

485
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,900
when I picture Itai?

486
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,900
Wow! Okay.
Actually, three words

487
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,900
that I will describe myself
are very similar

488
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,000
to the three words
one seeing my show

489
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
will describe me.

490
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I think I'm bringing
myself to the stage.

491
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
- Yeah.
- So when people

492
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,900
see me after the show,
they feel like they know me.

493
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,900
This is good.
This is my idea.

494
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,900
So I would go with --
in this order.

495
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:46,900
Funny, intelligent, humble.

496
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,900
- Interesting.
- Or modest.

497
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,900
I love it.
[laughter]

498
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,900
Itai, I love it,
I can't wait to see another show.

499
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,900
I can't believe it's been 11 years
since we met

500
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,900
when I was just 13 years old.

501
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,900
- And then that --
- We'll put the pictures.

502
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,900
I'm going to do this,
and the picture

503
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,900
will appear from your bar mitzvah.

504
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,900
Boom. [laughs]

505
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,900
Put it here with your editing.

506
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,900
I love it.
Itai, thank you so much

507
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,000
Thanks, Michael. See you soon.

508
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,900
Bye-bye!

509
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,900
Ciao!
