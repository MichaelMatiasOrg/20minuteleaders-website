1
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,966
All right. Hadar Pode, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

2
00:06:57,967 --> 00:06:59,899
Hey, thank you for having me.

3
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,099
It's so great to have you here. You're calling from Tel Aviv right now?

4
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:11,699
No, I actually am calling from Kiryat Ono where I live now. But previously I lived for many years in Tel Aviv.

5
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,299
And prior to that in Jerusalem and prior to that in New York. I was actually born in New York.

6
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:23,166
Amazing. Hadar, you have a very unique job which I think most entrepreneurs and most people

7
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:27,999
around me aren't even aware that it exists, especially in the industry that you're in.

8
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,566
What is the title that you hold within Porsche?

9
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:38,066
So, I work at a subsidiary Porsche called Porsche Digital and I'm a director there

10
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:41,832
and leading the activities, the innovation activities and scouting in Israel.

11
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:48,366
So leading the innovation and scouting activities in Israel for one of the most successful automobiles companies

12
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:54,732
in the world, a subsidiary of it that is intended for ventures, for innovation and creation.

13
00:07:54,733 --> 00:08:05,899
Why does a car manufacturing company, luxury car company need an arm of innovation and ventures?

14
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,566
So, I am sure that all of your viewers are aware that Israel is not a startup nation but now is

15
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:14,866
becoming a scale up nation and a lot of the technologies that are super relevant

16
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:21,532
not only for an organization as an organization but also as a mobility player or a tech giant

17
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:25,166
are coming from Israel. So, a lot of of machine learning --

18
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:28,299
What is difference between a scale up nation and a startup nation by the way?

19
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,332
So, you're not familiar?

20
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,932
I need to know.

21
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:38,632
Okay so, there's a shift in the mindset of now leaders, and investors, and entrepreneurs in Israel

22
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:45,299
trying to not just promote Israeli founders to start companies and sell them relatively quickly

23
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,032
but rather to expand them and not just sell them as fast as they can

24
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:51,932
but to build big big successful companies.

25
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:58,832
So I am personally very in favor of this shift. A paradigm shift.

26
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:05,166
And I hope that we'll see more and more companies scaling in Israel and not selling too fast our companies.

27
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:08,999
So, just for context, for every one who doesn’t understand, so we had this startup nation,

28
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,032
this wonderful, miraculous idea of Israel. This tiny hub of creativity and innovation by force.

29
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:19,432
People are forced to be innovative and creative from a very young age

30
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,966
generally attributed to the army.

31
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:25,532
And then we received some critics, some criticism as the exit nation

32
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:30,332
because we developed the amazing technologies and sell them short instead of trying to grow them

33
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:39,132
But recently we've seen some incredible innovators like Fiverr, Lemonade, Wix, Mobily, and so many more.

34
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:45,499
A ... that are now unicorns, ways of course, and so scale up nation.

35
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,666
Okay. Now, back to Porsche.

36
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:52,466
Yup, so we opened our facility officially in 2018.

37
00:09:52,467 --> 00:10:00,332
Prior to that, our leadership basically it came and was started to develop a very big interest

38
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,832
toward the Israeli market and the innovation coming from here.

39
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:09,566
And one thing led to another and they eventually decided that they need permanent people here.

40
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:16,166
An official office. And somebody that would pursue owning this activity.

41
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:21,332
I was lucky enough and privileged enough to be introduced to Porsche via Grove

42
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:26,666
which is a prominent VC in Israel.
Grove? Yeah, so

43
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:31,232
Porsche invested in Grove prior to me and my colleague--

44
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:32,966
Oh really. Okay, I didn’t know that.

45
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:36,199
Yeah. And they were looking for a person in Israel and we were connected.

46
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,399
I was quite hesitant while Porsche is reaching out to me.

47
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,932
I had actually an interview at my former office at Deloitte.

48
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:49,466
Basically met with them. Didn't know what they want but was truly excited about their idea of

49
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:53,266
developing something in Israel and seeking Israeli innovation

50
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:56,632
And with the hopes of deploying it.

51
00:10:56,633 --> 00:11:00,666
So yeah, something led to another. I joined in late 2018.

52
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,966
Basically, our office has two core activities.

53
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:10,499
One is Tech Scouting, not just for the sake of doing project or POCs but for the sake of deployment.

54
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,032
So, the range of--

55
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:16,266
What does that mean, deployment? When you think of deployment, what does that mean?

56
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:20,199
Does it actually mean integrating technology within the cars themselves?

57
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,099
Definitely. So, this is one. But also, on the enterprise level or production.

58
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,499
We seek to see technologies being integrated into our facilities.

59
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,966
Into our computers. Into everything.

60
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:40,099
So we worked together with our colleagues at Porsche AG, the parent company.

61
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,299
In ... where the R&D Center in Stuttgart

62
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,966
And we basically try to analyze potential companies.

63
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:54,366
We have basically a dual methodology of scouting, both a pull and a push.

64
00:11:54,367 --> 00:12:00,732
So, the most preferred way is to get companies to get a specific request from a business unit

65
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:03,099
To really understand the specific need.

66
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,932
And then to go and analyze the most relevant companies and to bring them to the table

67
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:11,566
and potentially do a POC, and once the POC is--

68
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:15,066
So this is like a top-down approach where you have a business unit within Porsche

69
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,466
that says, "Hey, we have this problem. Can we do some scouting?"

70
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:23,299
And see if there's any interesting early, middle, or late stage startups, perhaps in Israel

71
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,766
that are working in the space and then we can approach them proactively

72
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:31,799
and try to get some sort of collaboration. That's the way that you are referring to?

73
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,799
Yeah. So, this is the primary way where we see a very high conversion rate.

74
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,866
Because inherently we will have a business unit. We will have a project lead, a budget and everything.

75
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:47,099
But definitely we are extremely proactive in trying to advocate new companies,

76
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,999
or a new business models that are particularly interesting for a specific unit.

77
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,666
And sometimes the unit cannot really articulate themselves.

78
00:12:56,667 --> 00:13:00,166
Okay, we acknowledge this technology. Sometimes are not.

79
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:03,699
They will not be aware of what is exactly is in the market.

80
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:09,466
And this is why we also focus on meeting constantly with companies, and with VCs,

81
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:14,766
and with major stakeholders and trying to be ahead of the game, basically.

82
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:19,866
So, this is one arm we have conducted in 2019 over 10 POCs

83
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:24,332
We deployed several technologies. 2020 had a rough start with covid

84
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:31,099
But we were thankful enough to - just a little - to conduct various POCs and deployment

85
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:36,532
Yeah, so we're working hard. It's a small team but we're trying to do a lot.

86
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:40,832
And that is the whole investment side, right? Where you're actually a venture arm

87
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:44,099
that is making active investments in companies.

88
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:53,199
So, basically Porsche ventures is the CVC, the strategic investor arm of Porsche.

89
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:59,299
We invest in four different locations around the globe, in the US, Germany, China, and Israel.

90
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:05,099
My colleague Talia is more focusing on the investment side, I'm on the tech scouting.

91
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,132
But obviously we do everything together.

92
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:11,932
On to what? Sorry. You're focus on what?

93
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:13,899
I'm doing the tech scouting. Tech scouting. Okay

94
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,232
Yeah, yeah. Innovation and doing all of the project.

95
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:20,499
But it goes hand in hand. Because every investment,

96
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,366
we can't do an investment prior to validation of the technology. So, we will start with the POC

97
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:31,966
and then see that we're fascinated about the technology and we see a very disruptive approach

98
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:38,099
and then we will potentially proceed to analyzing a potential investment.

99
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,599
And you will only invest then in companies that are specifically relevant to your domain,

100
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,766
your expertise, and technologies that you can validate as Porsche, right?

101
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:51,699
So, definitely we are always looking how to push the boundaries

102
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:59,332
and do new types of mobility, and do things that are not just within the car

103
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:06,366
but definitely we have our core activity, but there are new topics and new things that we're looking at.

104
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:12,332
So constantly looking and trying to innovate also within the topics that are relevant for us.

105
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:16,599
Okay. So, talk to me a little bit about how you got into this.

106
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,866
It's not that ordinary to meet somebody who is working on the venture

107
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:27,266
and innovation arm of a car manufacturing company, a leading one especially at that, Porsche.

108
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:32,432
So, it's a very very cool job. But I loved to know who holds that job.

109
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:41,332
So, Deloitte ITT, a Lawyer for many years, who are you?

110
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,899
It's a tough question. I don't know. I'm not only my job roles, but I think I'm a person

111
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:50,832
who has a lot of other passions and interests. But I don't know.

112
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,766
Where do you wanted me to start from?

113
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:55,299
I wanna start from the passions. What are you actually passionate about?

114
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:01,032
You have a lot of background in the tech space now.

115
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:03,732
From a lot of different point, angles coming in to it.

116
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:05,199
What are you really really excited about?

117
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:15,432
Basically pushing innovation and trying to help big companies succeed through

118
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:23,999
collaboration with startups. So, obviously I'm a big passionate ambassador of the Israeli startup nation

119
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,399
And trying to support Israeli companies and founders.

120
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,899
But also want to try to help big corporations understand and acknowledge

121
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,699
that they can't solve everything internally. They need to utilize external technologies

122
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,366
to solve big problem and to make a big impact

123
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:45,532
So, yup. Passionate about impact and helping others.

124
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:49,699
That one ... the ITT, was the ITT sort of being an ambassador

125
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,266
and representative of the startup nation?

126
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:58,532
So, it's a good question. So, it's my time it was called Deloitte Innovation Tech Terminal

127
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:03,032
And now it is rebranded as Deloitte Catalyst.

128
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:08,532
So, me and my former colleague Amit Harel basically joined forces

129
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:13,899
to establish this new startup activity of Deloitte US and Israel

130
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,432
With the main aspiration of helping Deloitte's largest clients to tap in

131
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:23,499
to the Israeli ecosystem and try to find not only the best companies

132
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,732
but the right way to solve business issues through investments, acquisitions, and deployments.

133
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:32,232
And we've done quite similarly to what I do now

134
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:35,332
activities with Deloitte's largest clients

135
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:39,232
And we hosted C suite of fortune 100.

136
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:44,299
And we were divided, our team was divided into sectors.

137
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:51,499
So people, one guy was the domain manager in terms of mobility, and fintech, and retail, and healthcare

138
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,266
And we have a lot of very talented team members that were focusing on each domain

139
00:17:56,267 --> 00:18:04,566
And we basically helped really big clients understand how they can utilize exactly

140
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:09,632
the Israeli tech to solve their biggest issues

141
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:13,832
And through I think the two and a half years of my tenure there,

142
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:19,132
we were privileged to execute more than 80 global projects

143
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:25,466
We I think helped multinationals realize that they’re not only interested in deploying a certain technology

144
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:30,199
or potentially investing in a company but rather opening an R&D Center,

145
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,032
or an innovation hub in Israel.

146
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:39,999
So companies like TD Bank and others were good examples. And yeah, it was a great great time.

147
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,466
And it helped me to realize how fascinating this job could be

148
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:51,299
At the time I was a service provider essentially, so I was not making calling the shots, right?

149
00:18:51,300 --> 00:19:00,232
But I was helping. I was trying, our team was trying to support these decision makers in taking big changes.

150
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:06,632
In shifting mindsets and helping them solve their biggest issues through Israeli technologies.

151
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:10,199
I love it. I love it. And Hadar, so talk to me a little bit about this.

152
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:18,099
Some of the struggles of a large corporation to go and integrate you know POCs and software

153
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,466
from early or middle stage start ups. So, one of things you mentioned

154
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:26,599
that you're very excited about is helping large enterprises realize the potential

155
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:33,332
of the outside ecosystem and sort of amending some of the things that the company wants or need. Right?

156
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:37,999
So, instead of developing internally, going to say, "Okay, is there maybe a startup that can help us do that

157
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,999
and make that connection?" What are some of the difficulties, or some of the opportunities

158
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,466
that you're seeing within that realm?

159
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:52,632
So, the difficulties I think are quite obvious. So, organizations work much much much slower.

160
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:59,332
In comparison to startups that everyday it's a rollercoaster.

161
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:04,299
So, in one month you can pivot twice, you can raise a lot of funds.

162
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:10,399
you can expand the team or decrease the amount of the team, the FTEs by by I don’t know what.

163
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:17,932
And basically startups can’t really afford to have two months of execution of an NDA

164
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:21,932
prior to even seriously discussing a potential collaboration, right?

165
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:26,099
So, I think one of the big issue is to-- or not issue

166
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:31,132
but one of our rules is to try to expedite processes.

167
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:37,666
To try to help an organization understand that they need to be a bit more agile in their mindset.

168
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:42,266
How does that happen actually though? Do you actually go, so do you go to the senior vice president and say,

169
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:46,066
"Listen, you're now dealing with the startup. It's not another business,

170
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:50,899
Like get moving". How do you actually expedite the process for this?

171
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,932
Yeah. So, it’s quite delicate ‘cause we can’t be super super duper Israeli.

172
00:20:54,933 --> 00:21:00,999
We can’t push in after a meeting maybe 10 emails because they would not be very appreciative of that.

173
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:09,066
But we definitely try to do it to get things done as fast as we can.

174
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:16,266
To be very I don't know supportive and respective of the time of a company

175
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:22,032
that startup cannot afford too much time. And this is one major issue.

176
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:24,266
A lot of other things are cultural differences.

177
00:21:24,267 --> 00:21:31,166
You know sometimes, Israelis are very upfront and there are other things that

178
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:37,266
not every organization are, type of people as confrontational as Israelis.

179
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:42,466
And there are a lot of other differences that we try to mitigate or try to bridge.

180
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:47,099
There are bunch of other topics. I don't know.

181
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,632
I'm sure. You know I think is is fascinating just you know, considering this.

182
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:54,532
And I think what’s really fascinating is that where we're headed, and I'm saying this constantly here,

183
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:59,366
this idea that the world is changing so so fast.

184
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:02,932
A lot of these businesses, you know, you can look at covid coming in

185
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:07,532
And a great example is, one of my best friends has a startup in Tel Aviv

186
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:12,666
Covid hit and he's in the travel space. Covid hit, basically crushed his business

187
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:16,299
had to forego a third to a half of his employees,

188
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,266
and he was able to pivit within 24 hours and go to a whole new route.

189
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:25,666
And he actually built something that over a quarter of million of people use right now to help decide where to travel.

190
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:28,366
On the same note, you have larger companies,

191
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:31,066
Is it Miki, your friend? Yeah, Miki. Okay. There you go.

192
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:34,366
Yeah, he's in Israel. We know everybody.

193
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:41,232
Hi Miki. So, on the other hand you have large corporations which are getting covid

194
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:44,499
And now they have to decide. How long do we wait until we make that pivot?

195
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,066
How much are we considering this, how much pivoting can we do once we've already settled down

196
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:52,766
And we have this core business opportunity. And if we wanna pivot,

197
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:57,499
can we do it fast enough internally or do we wanna utilize a startup outside to do that?

198
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,032
So I think it's all really fascinating questions because I think covid was just an example

199
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:06,832
of circumstances that are gonna cause huge consumer shifts and market shifts

200
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,532
and we're just getting the knock on the head of,

201
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:13,699
"Okay, maybe we have to be a little bit more agile as a world than we were before."

202
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,266
But alright, I can't believe 20 minutes are almost up. It always saddens me.

203
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:20,632
Seriously. Okay, here we go.

204
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:21,866
I have to ask you the most important question.

205
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:26,066
I need three words that you would best describe yourself

206
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:30,066
or that any of your colleagues, or any of the startups that you have invested in

207
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:33,599
they would describe Hadar.

208
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,599
So it’s hard because I don’t like talking too much about myself

209
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,799
and I like to give, I don't know.

210
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,032
And just for the record, I'm forcing you to say this. This is not your choice.

211
00:23:43,033 --> 00:23:44,899
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay, I'll do it.

212
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,999
I think the first word would be doer

213
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,899
so I try to get it done. I'm very pragmatic and trying to push stuff forward

214
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,599
Second thing I think it correlates to what I said before.

215
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,732
So I'm very passionate whether it's with respect to my work, to Israel, to innovation, to helping people.

216
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:09,299
Stuff like that. Maybe Hillel could say some words about that.

217
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,599
And the third word would be connector

218
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:20,566
So through my job and also just my time of, I'd like to not only connect internally with people

219
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:26,799
but connect with other people and just connection and then people.

220
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,132
Something that I do on a daily basis.

221
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:32,732
I love it. Hadar, toda raba. Thank very very much.

222
00:24:32,733 --> 00:24:34,699
... You're awesome.

223
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,832
And I look forward to meeting you in Israel after this whole corona thing is over.

224
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:40,832
Yeah. Definitely yeah. Wonderful.

225
00:24:40,833 --> 00:25:55,800
Okay, bye. Thank you so much.
