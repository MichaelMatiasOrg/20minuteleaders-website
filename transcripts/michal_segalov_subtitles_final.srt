50
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:38,400
Michal Segalov, thank you so much

51
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,720
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

52
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,680
Thanks for having me.

53
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,000
So great to have you.

54
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,760
Software Engineering Director

55
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,280
at Google.

56
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,200
Co-founder of the amazing program

57
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Mind The Gap.

58
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,920
But I don't wanna talk about Google.

59
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,720
I don't wanna talk about

60
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,400
what's happening today.

61
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,320
I wanna go back.

62
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,840
I wanna hear your story

63
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,800
because it's such an incredible inspiration

64
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,920
for me when I first heard it

65
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,560
a few months ago

66
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,120
when we had coffee back

67
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,520
when you were allowed to have coffee

68
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,120
with another person in the same room

69
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,760
and not over Zoom.

70
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,080
Michal, take me away to your childhood.

71
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,440
How do you enter the engineering world?

72
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,960
So I think the story of how I got

73
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,520
into engineering and computer science

74
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,880
is kind of a story of

75
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,800
lucky or unlucky coincidences

76
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,120
depending on how you look at it.

77
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,280
And it's all been

78
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,840
kind of happening by chance.

79
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,480
So, growing up,

80
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,640
I was always exposed to computers

81
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,760
in the sense that I had two older brothers

82
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,680
and they were very much

83
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,240
into computer science.

84
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,200
But my exposure was,

85
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,520
I would say, almost negative.

86
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,720
I was very adamant and very convinced

87
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,480
on one thing:

88
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,880
that there is absolutely no way

89
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,200
that I would go into computer science.

90
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,800
I looked at it as this geeky,

91
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,960
and programming in general

92
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,200
right,

93
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,560
I looked at it as this geeky thing

94
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,920
that my older brothers are doing

95
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,200
and there was no way that someone

96
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,600
as cool as me at the time

97
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,035
would ever be interested in.

98
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,960
And I think that it was something that

99
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,680
I was very,

100
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,880
it was very much a part of

101
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,160
how I thought about it.

102
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,800
In fact, there is even stories

103
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,640
that run in my family about that time

104
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,920
where everyone tried

105
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,640
to teach me how to program.

106
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,400
And there was really a family effort

107
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,240
where my brothers

108
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,160
and my parents all kind

109
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,280
of gave it their own shot and

110
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,320
at different times reached

111
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,400
pretty much the same conclusion

112
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,720
that computer science and programming

113
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,680
is just not for me.

114
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,240
And is that just

115
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,040
because you're not enjoying it?

116
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,600
You're not willing to try it out?

117
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,480
Why did you reach that conclusion?

118
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,480
Or why did everybody else

119
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,280
reach that conclusion?

120
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,080
So, I actually interviewed them

121
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,080
not too long ago and asked them about it.

122
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,240
And I think that they,

123
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,640
of course, retroactively, they all gave

124
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,720
slightly different things than

125
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,200
I think what they thought

126
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,440
at the time.

127
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,880
But it was a mix of what they perceived

128
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,880
as lack of interest

129
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,480
and, at best, and maybe lack of skill

130
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,360
if you look at some of how they perceived

131
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,120
our interactions around computer science

132
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,360
and programming at the time.

133
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,240
So, I think that from my perspective,

134
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,600
and I think I kind of suppressed

135
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,400
that whole experience

136
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,640
because I didn't remember it as well

137
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,520
as they all did.

138
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,800
But I think kind of reflecting back,

139
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,600
I just didn't think of it as something

140
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,440
that would make sense for me to do

141
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,720
and I didn't really understand

142
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,240
what programming is

143
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,840
and what programming

144
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,720
essentially enables in my life

145
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,160
and in general.

146
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,040
So, I kind of took it for what it was,

147
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,720
which was okay

148
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,840
you type things in the computer

149
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,960
and then it spits out numbers

150
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,000
at you or does something at you.

151
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,680
And I didn't quite make that connection.

152
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,640
And I think the other component

153
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,880
is that I didn't even perceive myself

154
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,640
as the type of person

155
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,720
that could potentially do this, right.

156
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
The only people who I knew

157
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,560
that were programming at the time

158
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,280
were basically my two older brothers

159
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,360
or my two geeky older brothers. Right?

160
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,000
Right.

161
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,560
It wasn't something that I felt

162
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,570
very connected to.

163
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,20
And what ultimately did

164
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,400
clearly change things for me,

165
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,840
because obviously things have changed,

166
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,680
was actually the military.

167
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,360
So, I was born and raised in Israel

168
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,120
and of course, when you're 18 there's

169
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,080
a mandatory military service.

170
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,600
And one thing that the militarism

171
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,560
does very well

172
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,200
is utilize all of its possible resources.

173
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,280
And basically, they ran me through

174
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,080
a series of tests

175
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,880
at the end of which they decided that

176
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,400
computer programming is something

177
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,600
that I can potentially be quite good at.

178
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,040
So, different from your brothers

179
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,600
and your parents,

180
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,780
they don't ask you

181
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,720
and come up with a conclusion.

182
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,880
... they tell you,

183
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,920
"Michal, for the next three years,

184
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,680
you're gonna be a computer programmer."

185
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,840
Exactly. I even remember

186
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,640
that they asked me.

187
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,400
There was an in-person interview.

188
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,760
They asked me, "Would you be interested in that?"

189
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,520
And I said, "No."

190
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,000
For me, the military takes

191
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,280
your input into consideration

192
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,320
but ultimately that's what's

193
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,480
best for the military.

194
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,760
Right.

195
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,320
And that's kind of how I,

196
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,000
I guess, discovered this.

197
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,400
So, you become a software engineer.

198
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,400
Fast forward a few years

199
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,480
and you're already

200
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,960
you're a very, very successful

201
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,560
software engineer within Google.

202
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
A director within Google.

203
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,000
But looking back in retrospective,

204
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,320
So obviously you love

205
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,040
what you're doing.

206
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,920
I mean, you're a geek.

207
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,680
We can say now, proudly.

208
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,800
I am. I'm proud of it.

209
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,000
But Michal, going back to your childhood,

210
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,400
that was something that

211
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,760
you weren't really willing to accept.

212
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,120
And I think that I actually

213
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,560
can relate very very well

214
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,520
to what you're saying.

215
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,720
The first lines of code that

216
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,960
I really wrote were in the military.

217
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,640
And even though I come from a very techie,

218
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,400
and geeky household

219
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,880
I was never really into

220
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,120
computer programming.

221
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,800
Now, I love programming

222
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,240
both at Stanford and at Hippo

223
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,880
where I work and also in the IDF.

224
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,680
Why do you think that you weren't

225
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,120
interested in computer science?

226
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,160
Or why weren't you open to exploring

227
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,720
it back when you were a kid?

228
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,800
So I think the thing that my story,

229
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,360
when I reflect back,

230
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,000
when I think of it,

231
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,640
is that success and being successful

232
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,520
at something is very situational.

233
00:06:59,520 --> 00:06:59,960
Right.

234
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,080
And it's something that as a leader

235
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,840
is important for me to remember.

236
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
It's not that someone is

237
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,440
not good at something. Right?

238
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,240
Oftentimes, if that someone hasn't been

239
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,880
exposed to something in the right way,

240
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,880
that just makes things click.

241
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,920
Or sometimes it's that someone, that people

242
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,040
don't perceive themselves

243
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,440
as being able to excel at something.

244
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,520
And I think that in my case,

245
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,640
it was probably a combination where

246
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,440
I both didn't perceived myself

247
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,080
as someone who could do

248
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,640
this line of work.

249
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,920
But also I think it just

250
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,520
it might not have been the right time

251
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,440
or the right way to introduce me

252
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,280
into computer science.

253
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,800
And I was actually quite shocked

254
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,520
because when I talked to my brother,

255
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,480
who probably was the one

256
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,000
who was able to persevere along with

257
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,040
his attempts to try

258
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,200
and teach me very basic

259
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,760
computer science concepts,

260
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,600
the things that he said

261
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,040
that I didn't grasp at the time

262
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,080
are things that are quite trivial, right.

263
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,000
So I think it was more of a matter of

264
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,520
me being open to it

265
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,560
and also, how it was taught.

266
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,960
And somehow when I was

267
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,320
18 and in the military,

268
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,080
something just clicked.

269
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,720
And from there on it just kind of flowed.

270
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,200
I mean it resonates a lot with

271
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,680
a very interesting conversation I had

272
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,240
with another leader the other day

273
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,760
where they were talking about how,

274
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,400
when you're managing somebody

275
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,120
and they're not living up to their potential

276
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,040
by keeping them on the team

277
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,040
and by not giving them concrete feedback

278
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,480
or sometimes firing them when you need to,

279
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,400
you're actually doing a disservice to them

280
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,200
because you're not allowing them

281
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,240
to live up to the potential.

282
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,720
And maybe it's situational

283
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,280
that in the current place where they're at,

284
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
they're not able to do that.

285
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,560
Maybe they do have the skills,

286
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,520
but they're just not able to explore them

287
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,400
and to bring them to fruition.

288
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:42,560
But Michal,

289
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,760
you're taking your own experience

290
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,520
and then you did something

291
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,520
really amazing with it.

292
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,400
And you helped create an organization

293
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,880
called Mind the Gap.

294
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,640
So, tell me a little bit about what that is

295
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,000
and how that helped inspire other girls

296
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,840
to go into tech?

297
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,080
So, Mind The Gap is a program

298
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,760
that I started with Daniela Reichman,

299
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,240
who's also an engineering manager at Google

300
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,040
and is a close friend of mine.

301
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,400
We started it, I think it was in 2009

302
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:09,960
so quote some time ago,

303
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,320
with a goal of exposing young girls

304
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,040
to computer science and ...

305
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:20,120
And I think we took a pretty, I would say,

306
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,880
self centered point of view on things.

307
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,360
And we both had quite similar stories

308
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
of how we got into programming

309
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,880
and of being resistant to it

310
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,560
at that critical age.

311
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,640
And we basically wanted

312
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,440
to create something

313
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,800
that would cater to our younger selves

314
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,600
and try to expose our younger selves

315
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,800
to computer science programming

316
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,760
and show us what we see in it today.

317
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,560
Right. What is the younger self?

318
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,040
So, what age are we talking about

319
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,800
which is really the critical age

320
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,640
that you've understood is where

321
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,080
you should inject yourself in?

322
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,520
So, it's around junior high school.

323
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,560
The reason we chose that age is because

324
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,160
if you look at the funnel of when

325
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,840
girls and minorities drop out of I would say

326
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,080
the path towards computer science,

327
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,520
that's around the time that it happens.

328
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,400
In Israel it seems particularly pronounced

329
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,560
because all the AP classes,

330
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,440
the selection of what you do your APs

331
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,280
in basically happens at that time.

332
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,360
Right. Because so in Israel,

333
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,760
differently than in a lot of other

334
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,640
places, especially the US,

335
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,360
you actually choose a profession

336
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,480
back already in high school

337
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,880
or you choose what is your specialization.

338
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,520
And Israel is very well known with that. Right?

339
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,400
That very early on, you have to sort

340
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,040
of choose what is your path.

341
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,680
And oftentimes after the army

342
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,280
and after you usually go to India

343
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,840
or South America,

344
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,200
you rediscover your roots

345
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,840
and what you wanna do.

346
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,520
Okay. So interesting.

347
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,240
So, you go in and what do you actually do

348
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,720
with these young women

349
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,840
and what impact does this have?

350
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,440
So, we basically try to think of

351
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,640
what are the main causes that

352
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,800
create this drop.

353
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,480
And I think much like

354
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,680
the story that I told about myself,

355
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,080
it's a mix of things.

356
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,720
So, one is many of them

357
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,560
just don't understand

358
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,960
what computer science is.

359
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,000
It seems as, there's like code thing

360
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,720
where you do something at the computer

361
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,440
all by yourself and something happens

362
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,040
and it doesn't really relate

363
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,800
to our day to day lives.

364
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,560
It's perceived as a profession

365
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,800
that is very solitary

366
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,960
where you don't actually work

367
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,840
with ... people

368
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,080
and you don't have to leverage

369
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,040
any people skills that you might have.

370
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,680
And finally, there aren't enough,

371
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,480
unfortunately, role models.

372
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:39,160
So, even if you know

373
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,240
what computer science is,

374
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,600
you don't not necessarily think of yourself

375
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,960
as someone who could go in that path

376
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,560
just because you don't see yourself

377
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,960
in the people who are successful.

378
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,160
So, it's almost like a chicken

379
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,080
and the egg problem

380
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,760
because, yeah. Self-explanatory.

381
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,600
Yeah. So, we basically started

382
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,680
office visits at the Google office

383
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,720
where initially,

384
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,760
they were on a monthly basis,

385
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,800
later on a weekly basis,

386
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,680
where we would bring in

387
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,520
a group of girls.

388
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,160
And we would give them a lecture, a

389
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,160
technical talk about computer science.

390
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,880
And the way that we tailored it

391
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,800
is very much explaining how

392
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,520
computer science

393
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,800
touches our day to day lives. Right?

394
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,080
Computer science is everywhere.

395
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,640
It's in our phones.

396
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,400
It's in our cars.

397
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,280
It's all around us.

398
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,520
So, creating that connection

399
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,720
and making them see the impact

400
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,480
that they could have

401
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,440
on people's lives

402
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,600
via computer science

403
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,880
is one very important thing.

404
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,160
Then we also had a panel

405
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,840
where we brought in different types

406
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,720
of disciplines under computer science.

407
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,560
The computer science or

408
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,800
engineering umbrella.

409
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,400
There's product management,

410
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,200
software engineering.

411
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,040
There is UX, user experience, research,

412
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,200
and many many other things

413
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,720
just to show the diversity

414
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,720
of skills that one might need

415
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,440
or might be able to leverage

416
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,960
when going down that path.

417
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,280
Now Michal, I have to say that

418
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,960
I relate so much to what you're saying

419
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,840
because just like this,

420
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,360
I was under the same impression

421
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,480
going through high school and

422
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,040
I took AP Computer Science.

423
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,800
I knew Java

424
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,240
I knew whatever,

425
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,280
but I still thought that, yes,

426
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,240
it's just about writing code.

427
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,000
There is no relationship to the real life.

428
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,640
And honestly,

429
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,120
it's also because the curriculum

430
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,560
in school it's in a cube.

431
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,000
You don't really understand

432
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,440
the connection to computers outside.

433
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,600
You learn the algorithms

434
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,400
and you learn the math,

435
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,080
but you don't learn

436
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,160
how it impacts you.

437
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,480
Now, you mean in 2020, literally,

438
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,200
almost everything in the room here

439
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,040
has an operating system.

440
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,440
Everything has a brain.

441
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,280
And I consider myself a product guy.

442
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,240
I consider myself as

443
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,400
someone who loves people.

444
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,080
I love user experience.

445
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,480
But because I have this knowledge

446
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,320
of computer science,

447
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,720
I'm able to actually think

448
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,080
about what products

449
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,960
I could potentially build.

450
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,080
And I'm so thankful that I got,

451
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,440
that the Army pushed me to learning this.

452
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,760
And that's why I can relate so well

453
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,320
to what you're saying

454
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,520
because as a high schooler

455
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,600
and in middle school,

456
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,760
it's so hard to understand this.

457
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,040
It's, so basically the way I think

458
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,400
of programming, it's a tool

459
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,320
that gives you this magical ability

460
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,560
to build the things

461
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,600
that could change people's lives.

462
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,440
And this is what Mind the Gap is about.

463
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,240
Showing that to younger girls.

464
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,560
And the program has been going on

465
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,720
for 10 years,

466
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,040
just over 10 years now.

467
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,160
There's about five thousand girls a year

468
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,720
that go through it.

469
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,200
Five thousand girls a year?

470
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,680
Oh, my.

471
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,040
Yeah.

472
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,680
Wow.

473
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,520
That's incredible.

474
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:25,840
Yeah.

475
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,080
So, it's basically,

476
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,000
I hope, the next generations

477
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,840
of women computer scientists

478
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,040
will go through it.

479
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,960
And it keeps evolving it keeps changing

480
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,040
based on feedback that we get

481
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,720
and things that we see are working

482
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,400
and are not working.

483
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,680
And I should say that Daniela and I

484
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,600
are no longer actively running the program.

485
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,560
There's basically a new generation

486
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,520
of amazing leaders that are

487
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,000
doing this wonderful, wonderful work.

488
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,880
And I think that's a part

489
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,560
of what I quite like about it.

490
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,720
The fact that it's not built

491
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,640
around Daniela or around me.

492
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,120
It's built around the actual content.

493
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,800
And I think that's a huge vote of confidence

494
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,480
that you have this inspiration for others

495
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,760
to continue with it.

496
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,280
And five thousand girls a year,

497
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,480
that's just incredible.

498
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,920
Okay. And, you know,

499
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,920
before we started this

500
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,520
we were talking a little bit about

501
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,960
a personal board of directors.

502
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,840
I think that's a fascinating term.

503
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,160
I can't wait to hear what it means.

504
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,280
So, when I reflect on my career

505
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,040
and things that have helped me most.

506
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,240
The thing that I think

507
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,680
is most pronounced in my career

508
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,760
is what I call this

509
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,600
"personal board of directors" Right

510
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,640
So, it's a set of people who are my mentors.

511
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,960
And much like a board of directors

512
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,320
we meet regularly.

513
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,760
I take their advice, or I listen to their advice

514
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,480
right ultimately, it's up to me.

515
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,440
We're all vested together in this thing called

516
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,640
each other's success, right

517
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,800
It's very much a mutual relationship.

518
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,560
And I think that it helps me a lot

519
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,840
because oftentimes just hearing

520
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,200
someone else's perspective on things

521
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,640
is quite valuable.

522
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,240
And these people, a lot of them

523
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,120
have been with me for a decade now

524
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,800
now or even more, right.

525
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,880
So, they know me, sometimes,

526
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,600
even maybe better than I know myself.

527
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,680
Right.

528
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,600
So, having them say certain things

529
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:19,920
is something that

530
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,760
more often than you'd expect,

531
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,800
actually, makes me change my mind

532
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,600
or see things differently.

533
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,200
Amazing.

534
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,200
And I think it started

535
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,640
actually when the group of women

536
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,280
that were doing Mind the Gap,

537
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,970
initially where we would meet for

538
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,840
Mind The Gap reasons or whatnot

539
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,800
and overtime basically

540
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,360
we built this community

541
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:52,520
...

542
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,920
I'm a mother of two very cute kids.

543
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,720
Yeah, we can cut that out if we need to.

544
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,720
You know, it's very cute.

545
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,960
So maybe I'll start with the board of directors question again?

546
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,560
So, most people when they

547
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,720
think of board of directors,

548
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,440
they think of people who come in

549
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,520
and they have power over your organization

550
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,550
or over your work.

551
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,590
They have, your voting a lot.

552
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,070
You have to please them.

553
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,320
What it sounds to me is that

554
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,560
you formed these group of mentors

555
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,320
that you deeply respect

556
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,680
and they respect you

557
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,520
and they're not voting on anything

558
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,920
and you're not trying to please them,

559
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,280
but they are people

560
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,320
who are following your journey.

561
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,830
And when you say that they're invested

562
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,040
in this, it means that they've

563
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,590
invested in the relationship. Right?

564
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,790
They believe you.

565
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,110
And they love working with you

566
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,360
or they love helping you

567
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,440
achieve your potential.

568
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,830
Yeah. It's basically that.

569
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,400
And oftentimes the people who I've worked with

570
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,800
in the past -

571
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,680
No problem.

572
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,560
So, yeah, it is very much that

573
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,200
it's people who oftentimes

574
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,240
have either worked with

575
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,800
or have met professionally otherwise.

576
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,400
And there's always something

577
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,560
that I deeply respect

578
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,000
and want to learn from them.

579
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,510
Right.

580
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,880
And we tried to,

581
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,080
I would hope that it's also mutual

582
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,240
and there's something that some of them

583
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,200
would want to learn from me.

584
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,160
But it's definitely focused about the thing

585
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,640
that I admire about this person,

586
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,070
the thing I wanna get their opinion on.

587
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,720
I love it.

588
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,920
Michael, I wanna go up 30,000 feet in the air

589
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,480
and I wanna look as an overview

590
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,590
of what's happening today in the space.

591
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,400
We can go on things like Mind the Gap

592
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
or we can talk about

593
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,750
different experiences you have.

594
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,680
But what are some of the biggest challenges

595
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,040
you think that we're facing now

596
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,480
in the industry with computer science,

597
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,280
whether that's on the education perspective

598
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,480
or the personal fulfillment perspective.

599
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,640
Because now you're a leader,

600
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,440
you're managing quite a few people

601
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,720
within a large organization like Google.

602
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,680
You've gone through this whole experience

603
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,350
yourself with mentors.

604
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,640
And I'd love to pick your brain

605
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,880
over the next few minutes.

606
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,920
What are the biggest challenges

607
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,480
and what can I take with me

608
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
as a young engineer,

609
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,840
as a young entrepreneur,

610
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,760
and keeping in mind for the future?

611
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,440
So, first I think that focus

612
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,520
is one of the things that pretty much

613
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,160
reshape and got a lot of leaders,

614
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
myself included,

615
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,960
to rethink things that

616
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,240
...

617
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,040
The ability to talk to your peers

618
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,920
face to face or to meet people

619
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,880
and how to create this.

620
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,920
It's effectively a new leadership style

621
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,400
where you find yourselves

622
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,800
talking to a computer, to a camera

623
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,800
and you might not even see all the people

624
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,790
that you're talking to.

625
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,180
So, it's very different

626
00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:34,560
than what we're used to

627
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:38,200
and how to adjust running an organization

628
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,460
where people have lives

629
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,440
people have kids.

630
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,070
And where do you create that boundary?

631
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,480
Where we work and live

632
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,030
in the same place right now.

633
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,000
So, when is work? When is life?

634
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,350
How do you mix the two?

635
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,800
So I think that is definitely something that

636
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,680
I don't have a good answer on just yet,

637
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,560
but it's definitely something

638
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,840
that I'm thinking of.

639
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,310
And how should I adapt

640
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,200
my leadership style.

641
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,280
I mean it sounds like something

642
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,680
almost every manager in the world now

643
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,400
has to adapt to

644
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,880
because nobody really

645
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,350
experienced this before.

646
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,560
This magnitude of lack of work life balance,

647
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,880
when the sofa is both work and your sofa

648
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,270
And different people, of course,

649
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,510
are impacted differently.

650
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
If you think of parents,

651
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,510
they're probably a population

652
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,920
that has a much more difficult time

653
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,440
and their challenges are quite different

654
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,240
than maybe someone

655
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,200
who lives on their own

656
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,960
and maybe even social distancing is

657
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,160
more difficult than that person.

658
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,640
So, I think each person has

659
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,070
very different needs.

660
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,440
And it's important for leaders

661
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,680
and organizations to think of that,

662
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,880
take that into consideration

663
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,480
and not necessarily expect,

664
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,560
it's not a mold that you can apply,

665
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,640
or that every person can apply.

666
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,800
Michal, what are you most excited about

667
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,800
in computer science?

668
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,640
In the industry?

669
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,880
The field that I work on,

670
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,320
which is natural language understanding

671
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,920
and I view as something

672
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,560
that I am personally very excited about.

673
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,790
I think that it's an area that's

674
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,400
been evolving very rapidly.

675
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,000
If you think like ...

676
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,840
and basically you see these abilities

677
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,640
that maybe years ago

678
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,760
seemed like science fiction

679
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,640
or something that,

680
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,160
think of the Turing test as an example, right?

681
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,360
I think you are supposed to recognize

682
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,270
whether or not a person is speaking to you

683
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,510
or a computer

684
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,440
Right.

685
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,840
And I think that the advancements

686
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,960
that were made are quite impressive

687
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,000
state-of-the-art advancements,

688
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,680
and I think that now

689
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,200
we're starting to see those

690
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,720
basically being built at scale

691
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,240
by a lot of the larger companies,

692
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,400
like Google being one of them.

693
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,760
So that's an area

694
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
that I think will keep evolving.

695
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,200
And I think that we will see

696
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,760
more applications on products

697
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,920
of the technology that we know is there.

698
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,120
And I think that the challenge

699
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,030
there is two-fold.

700
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,040
So, one is finding the right set of products

701
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,440
and how to leverage that in a way

702
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,360
that's engaging on the one hand

703
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,760
and doesn't have the creepy element

704
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,600
let's say on the other hand. Right?

705
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,200
And on the other hand,

706
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,640
I think a very big technical challenge

707
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,160
of how to apply these algorithms at scale.

708
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,920
When you think of the scale that

709
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,480
a product like Google and some of the others
ones need it.

710
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,160
So for me, I think that applies

711
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,640
for a very wide set of challenges.

712
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,080
I think it's fascinating that you get

713
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,360
to build products and work on technologies

714
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,790
that at the end they impact immediately.

715
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,110
Hundreds of millions of customers.

716
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,800
It's something that I think

717
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,080
any engineer can only dream of

718
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,840
getting to really having

719
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,120
a production code run and

720
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,400
impact the lives of so many people.

721
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,400
And I think that's probably the most

722
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,110
incredible motivation you can have

723
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,400
for building great products

724
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,520
because I know that a lot of people

725
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,120
are passionate for algorithms

726
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,720
for the sake of algorithms.

727
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,680
You know, I know about myself.

728
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,720
I'm passionate about impact

729
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,200
and how to use technologies

730
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,680
and deep technologies to impact

731
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,880
the lives of people.

732
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,800
I think what you're doing

733
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,280
there is just incredible.

734
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,440
Michal, before we leave,

735
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,320
I have to put you on the spot

736
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:00,960
one last time.

737
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,880
And I need three words that you

738
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,600
would use to describe yourself.

739
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,790
Three words. Wow. Engineer.

740
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,520
The hardest question.

741
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,440
but already know the answer.

742
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,360
Okay, engineer.

743
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,360
Persistent.

744
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,040
Mother.

745
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,920
Engineer, persistent, mother.

746
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,508
It sounds like -

747
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:21,760
Not necessarily in that order

748
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,590
I love it.

749
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,400
Michal, thank you very much.

750
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,480
Toda raba

751
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,760
and best of luck through

752
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,000
these difficult times.

753
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,800
Thank you.

754
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,350
It was great.

755
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,280
Thanks for having me.

756
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,160
Take care.

757
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,310
Bye bye.

758
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,110
Bye.
