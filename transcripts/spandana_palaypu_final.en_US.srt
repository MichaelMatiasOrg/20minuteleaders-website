1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,400
So, don't be deterred

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,600
by a no in any way.

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,080
Frankly, I got so many no's in 2017.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,200
But, and obviously there were

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,320
self-doubt moments as well.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,160
I was like, oh my God,

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,600
am I doing this the right way?

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,040
I don't know what's going on.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,920
Spandana Palaypu,

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,320
thank you so much for joining me

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:44,880
all the way from

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,200
the United Arab Emirates.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,920
How are you?

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
Good. Good. Thank you.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,840
Thank you for having me.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,240
Thank you very much for being here.

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,880
I just came back

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,720
from a wonderful trip to Dubai.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,040
It was remarkable,

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,040
eye-opening and getting to know

21
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,760
a whole new, very similar,

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,000
yet very different culture.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,760
I'm calling from Tel Aviv.

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,920
And I think that although

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,960
the locals in Dubai and Israelis

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,720
are very similar in a lot of ways,

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,400
there's a lot of cultural differences

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,200
in how business is done,

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,200
how relationships are formed.

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,080
So, I think it was very fascinating.

31
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,440
I'm glad to hear that.

32
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,440
I mean, considering

33
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,400
everything's opened up now,

34
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,480
I'm just glad to see that,

35
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,960
you know, things are progressing

36
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,560
in the right direction.

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,840
100%. And while

38
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,200
we're waiting for you here in Tel Aviv,

39
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,000
but in the meantime,

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,960
I'll have to gauge your brain here

41
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,760
in these next 20 minutes.

42
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,320
Spandana, you've had a remarkable

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
journey leading up to ZoEasy.

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,960
And I'd love to focus on that as well.

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,080
But first, I have to go back

46
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,000
and understand a little bit

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,080
about your passions

48
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,800
and the different things

49
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,680
that you've done

50
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,200
from the different speaking engagements

51
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
and being ambassadors

52
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,800
of different organizations.

53
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,880
I actually also participated

54
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,000
in the EPGY program at Stanford,

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,840
just like you did.

56
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,280
But tell me a little bit about

57
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,680
what's been happening

58
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,840
with you up until now.

59
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,320
So, honestly, like just a regular

60
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,920
25 year old if you ask me.

61
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,360
The whole drive around

62
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,640
education and employment,

63
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,560
that was always

64
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,160
instilled in me as a child.

65
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,360
To be honest, I've always been

66
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,400
the kind of person

67
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,960
that was into community service

68
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,200
and doing things

69
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,360
in relation to education.

70
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,160
I used to teach in high school

71
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,960
and I used to teach kids

72
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,280
from underprivileged backgrounds

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,320
and I used to teach children

74
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,040
with learning disabilities as well.

75
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,760
So, education and employment

76
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,680
have always been very close to my heart.

77
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,520
And I also come from a very strong

78
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,760
entrepreneurial family.

79
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,200
So, like my dad's an entrepreneur,

80
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,360
my uncle's an entrepreneur.

81
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,680
So, you know, that I think also

82
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,000
kind of instilled a little bit

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,640
of that business part within me

84
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,120
when I was younger.

85
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,400
And I knew that I wanted to do something

86
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,560
that was in relation to education,

87
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,200
employment or health care.

88
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,920
But I didn't really know

89
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,960
what was the right path

90
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,120
to kind of pursue for that.

91
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,720
Do I go into medicine,

92
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,000
because medicine was something

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,880
that I had considered at one point.

94
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,640
Or do I go into business.

95
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,840
And being from a traditional

96
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,520
South Indian family,

97
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,320
you know, business is usually like

98
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,160
a wary subjected to you.

99
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,600
Either go into engineering

100
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,400
or you go into medicine.

101
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,680
Those are your two key career choices.

102
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,320
But I remember sitting my parents down

103
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,160
and like taking them

104
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,920
through this entire decision matrix

105
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,800
of who I thought like business

106
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,680
was the right options.

107
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,680
And post university, honestly,

108
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,240
it reached a point where

109
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,960
I wanted to actually go into consulting

110
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,200
before starting my own social enterprise,

111
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,720
because ultimately that was the end goal.

112
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,320
But as I was applying for jobs

113
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,560
and I even got an offer

114
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,200
from a big four.

115
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,000
At the same time,

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,200
I was also working on ZoEasy as an idea

117
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:01,720
because, I mean, growing up in the UAE

118
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,560
you do get to interact with people

119
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,440
from diverse backgrounds,

120
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,880
different walks of life.

121
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,720
And a big part of that

122
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,520
is the blue collar community.

123
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,200
And so, hearing their stories is truly

124
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,000
it's a remarkable experience

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,640
because you meet engineers

126
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,000
who are working as cleaners.

127
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,400
You'll meet waiters who actually

128
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,080
have teaching backgrounds.

129
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,160
So, you know, these are people

130
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,360
that are actually skilled

131
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,280
but end up in different circumstances,

132
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,240
mainly because of middlemen

133
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,000
and brokers in their home countries

134
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,960
who sell them a dream,

135
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,240
which is very different to reality.

136
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,520
And in the process,

137
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,920
they even pay almost $3,000

138
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,387
to find employment abroad, you know.

139
00:04:44,388 --> 00:04:46,120
So, that was when

140
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,400
that spark kind of instilled within me,

141
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,840
and I knew that this was like,

142
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,880
this was my purpose and my passion.

143
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,240
And so, when somebody had come forward

144
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,200
and shown an interest

145
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,440
in investing in ZoEasy

146
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,360
and so that was when I decided, okay,

147
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,200
let's give this path a try

148
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,040
and see how that goes.

149
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,840
Let's talk a little bit more about this,

150
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
about, you know, the circumstances

151
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,800
when you see blue color,

152
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,640
what do you mean by that?

153
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,840
So, anybody that,

154
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,120
so, in the UAE, a blue collar worker

155
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,280
is essentially defined

156
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,040
as somebody that earns about

157
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,600
5,000 dirhams or less.

158
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,400
And you have a variation

159
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,280
of these professions.

160
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,840
So, it ranges from unskilled

161
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,040
to skilled to semi-skilled.

162
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,120
And what I mean by unskilled is

163
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,840
so, for example, if you ask somebody

164
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,760
to pick up a box

165
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,360
and put it somewhere like,

166
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,480
something like that,

167
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,320
that would be considered

168
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,920
an unskilled person.

169
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,600
But you can also go up

170
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,560
to a skill level where,

171
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,560
you know, sometimes some nurses

172
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,720
and some nurses

173
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,480
are also considered as a part

174
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,960
of the blue/gray collar industry.

175
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,360
So, it's a very wide variation.

176
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,880
So, it ranges from waiters

177
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,280
to the construction industry,

178
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,040
hospitality facilities management,

179
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,480
a lot of people that work

180
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,880
in these industries fall into

181
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,320
the blue collar community.

182
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,680
And there are almost

183
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,040
four million blue collar workers

184
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,640
in the UAE.

185
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,080
So, that's 43% of the population.

186
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,520
It's a massive, yes,

187
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,440
it's a massive number.

188
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,200
It's a huge part of the community.

189
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,720
So, you get to interact

190
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,480
with them on a regular basis.

191
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,880
And that's how I grew up.

192
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,120
You know, like I was always exposed

193
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,760
to different nationalities,

194
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,600
different communities,

195
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,080
different backgrounds.

196
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,040
And so, that's where you hear

197
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,640
about these stories.

198
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,840
So, tell me a little bit about ZoEasy.

199
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,600
What were some of the insights

200
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,280
that you've gained

201
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,000
on how to potentially tackle

202
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,160
these circumstances

203
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,320
that obviously are not ideal?

204
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,920
Of course.

205
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,880
So, like I mentioned of

206
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,240
as I was doing my research

207
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,320
and speaking to more people, you know,

208
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,280
I realized that it's not actually

209
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,000
a problem that starts in the UAE.

210
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's a problem that starts

211
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,160
at the very source,

212
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,240
from the country that

213
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,560
these job seekers are coming from.

214
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,640
They're coming to the UAE

215
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,800
to find better employment opportunities.

216
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,160
And honestly, I have come across

217
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,360
many people who, yes,

218
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,960
have come here under a certain pretext.

219
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,720
But after joining the firm

220
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,760
and understanding that

221
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,680
there are ethical employers out here,

222
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,200
they have been able to save up

223
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,080
and create a better standard of living

224
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,600
for their families back home

225
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
at the end of it.

226
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:25,920
But what we aim to do

227
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,520
and what we want to bring as a change

228
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,800
to the whole system

229
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,400
is essentially removing

230
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,480
this network of middlemen.

231
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,280
Because both employers and job seekers

232
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,080
have to go through

233
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,040
about six layers of middlemen

234
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,600
before an employee is actually hired.

235
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,880
So, employers aren't exactly benefiting

236
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,000
because there is no other alternatives

237
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,200
in the market, you know.

238
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,680
You have a lot

239
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,560
of white-collar talent platforms

240
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:50,960
out there,

241
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,960
but you don't have anything

242
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,600
that is catering

243
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,240
to the blue collar community.

244
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
And so, in the process,

245
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,280
you have to rely

246
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,880
on this paper based archaic system.

247
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,360
And a lot of employers do pay for,

248
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,520
they pay these middlemen

249
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,680
recruitment fees,

250
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,120
but they end up with job seekers

251
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,600
that aren't exactly the right fit

252
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,760
for what they're looking for.

253
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,680
Similarly, job seekers

254
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,120
don't exactly have the right guidance

255
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,280
or skills to be able

256
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,000
to find employment opportunities

257
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,880
that are in line

258
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,960
with their career aspirations.

259
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,280
And so, in the process,

260
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,960
this is the only method that's out there.

261
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,760
This has been happening

262
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,440
for the last 40 to 50 years.

263
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,280
There's no other alternatives

264
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,920
in the industry.

265
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,000
And so you rely on a middleman

266
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
who sells you this wonderful dream.

267
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,240
Oh, you're going to be right next

268
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,160
to the Burj Khalifa.

269
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,280
It's going to be a great, great job,

270
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,160
great experience for you.

271
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,680
And that message

272
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,640
that the employer puts forward

273
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,040
gets completely diluted

274
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,880
by the time it reaches the job seeker.

275
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,120
So, in the process,

276
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,640
employers aren't happy,

277
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,280
jobseekers aren't happy.

278
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,560
Both have shed money

279
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,160
because it goes to the middlemen.

280
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,080
So, it's not a win win

281
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,280
for either party, to be honest.

282
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,720
And that's what we're trying to tackle.

283
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,760
Ensure that good employers

284
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,600
get access to good people

285
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,000
and good people get access

286
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,600
to the right employment opportunities

287
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,440
so that they can create

288
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,600
a better standard of living

289
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,680
for their families back home.

290
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,400
And you mentioned that a part of it,

291
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,880
part of the dissonance

292
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,720
that we have here is that,

293
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
people that have certain skill sets,

294
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,120
they don't actually come to fruition

295
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,680
in locally in the UAE,

296
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,160
where you're specifically looking at.

297
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,880
How is ZoEasy actually

298
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,760
compromising on that?

299
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,160
Right.

300
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,040
So, we actually,

301
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,440
so one, we did a pilot

302
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,480
placement, actually.

303
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,560
We wanted to understand

304
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,240
how the system worked

305
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,560
and what the issues were around

306
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,760
this whole sector.

307
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,360
And you don't really have

308
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,640
a lot of data out there

309
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,280
in relation to this industry

310
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,000
unless you go and you tackle

311
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,040
this first hand yourself.

312
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,840
So, we did a pilot placement

313
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,200
of 150 people.

314
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,240
We also generated a massive database,

315
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,120
but from within that database,

316
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,800
we chose one 150 people,

317
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,760
150 job seekers that we could place

318
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,360
within different industries.

319
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,640
So, we looked at industries

320
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,960
like construction, hospitality

321
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,280
and so on.

322
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,840
And we understood

323
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,800
what the hindrances were offline

324
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,280
and what were the processes

325
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,960
that we could move online

326
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,760
to make the system more ethical

327
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,160
and more transparent.

328
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,200
And that could also help jobseekers

329
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,120
showcase their skills in better ways.

330
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,240
So, that's where we came up

331
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,520
with the concept of implementing things

332
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,920
like video CVs and live interviewing.

333
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,240
Because many of these job seekers

334
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,200
don't know how to write good CVs,

335
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,600
but they know

336
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,640
how to express themselves really well.

337
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,480
So, that's where these tools

338
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,760
will come in to provide

339
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,320
a more holistic perspective

340
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,680
of the job seeker.

341
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,480
And that also reduces a lot of

342
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,720
like the travel costs that are involved

343
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,960
for employers who would otherwise

344
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,320
have to travel to India

345
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,200
or travel to parts of Southeast Asia

346
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,600
in order to be able to recruit people

347
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,000
from the ground.

348
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,440
You know what I mean?

349
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,000
Right.

350
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,880
So, just for context,

351
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,520
out of the 40% blue collar workers

352
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,440
in the UAE,

353
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,120
what is the estimated percentage of them

354
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,680
that could be transformed

355
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,480
into skilled workers

356
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,400
but they're just out of circumstance,

357
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,680
positioned as blue collar workers

358
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,720
in unskilled positions?

359
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,600
Honestly, a big chunk.

360
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,040
I would say easily about

361
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,520
28 to 30% can be converted.

362
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,640
It's a big chunk.

363
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
There are people, there are first timers

364
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,480
that come out here

365
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,920
and then move up the ladder.

366
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,160
There are people like that.

367
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,920
But a big majority that you meet

368
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,920
are actually skilled people

369
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,120
who have ended up

370
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,560
in the wrong employment opportunities

371
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,960
because of some middlemen

372
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,800
in their home country.

373
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,400
So, it's about the way

374
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,040
you showcase your skills

375
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,240
and how you can put that forward.

376
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,960
And what we do is we explicitly

377
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,480
work with ethical employers.

378
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,840
So, we look for employers

379
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,560
who have strong HR, CSR policies in place.

380
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,840
We work with employers

381
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,560
who have a focus on diversity

382
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,960
and inclusion because,

383
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,640
you know, industries like manufacturing,

384
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,160
for example, they don't employ

385
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,200
a lot of women,

386
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,360
even though a lot of women

387
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,280
can actually be skilled for that job.

388
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,360
And in fact, we tied up

389
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,080
with one such employer recently,

390
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,000
like Deltron Paints is very focused

391
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,880
on diversity and inclusion,

392
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,280
and they want to include more women

393
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
in the workforce.

394
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,640
So, finding employers like that

395
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,440
to work with is also very important

396
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,320
because they create

397
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
a great environment

398
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,120
for the candidate to thrive in.

399
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,440
And so, we identify employers

400
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,320
like that to work with.

401
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
But simultaneously,

402
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,200
you also need to look

403
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,600
at the job seeker themselves.

404
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,720
And it's not just about

405
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,640
the skill that they have,

406
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,000
but their personality

407
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,360
also plays a big role

408
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,320
in who they are.

409
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,960
I mean, we placed somebody

410
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,880
that was actually

411
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,040
from the logistics industry.

412
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,960
And he was earning about

413
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,600
1500 dirhams a month. Right?

414
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:06,720
Wow.

415
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,680
And yeah, he was earning

416
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,760
1500 dirhams a month to start with.

417
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,120
And something happened at his workplace.

418
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,920
One of his coworkers

419
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,520
had said, it was,

420
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,880
there was a racial comment made

421
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,760
towards him.

422
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,560
So, he decided to leave.

423
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,800
And he had a 30 day grace period

424
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,920
within which he had to find

425
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,840
another employment opportunity.

426
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,800
And so, that's when

427
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,960
we got connected.

428
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,880
And when we met him, honestly, he is

429
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,360
one of the most wonderful people

430
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,040
you will meet.

431
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,520
He's so great to talk to

432
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,800
and he has so much wisdom to give.

433
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,880
I mean, there were things that

434
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,840
I learned as a person from him.

435
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,880
Some of his quotes were unbelievable.

436
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,440
And that's when

437
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,760
I realized that this guy

438
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,160
could actually be a great fit

439
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,960
in the hospitality industry

440
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,560
and he'd be able to earn

441
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,320
even more than

442
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
what he was earning

443
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,960
in the logistics space.

444
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,800
And so, we placed him

445
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,200
with the hospitality employer.

446
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,600
And he I mean, there was

447
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,280
he almost had like

448
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,800
a 50% boost in his salary

449
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,400
because you're not only getting a base,

450
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,160
but you're also getting tips

451
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,960
from customers

452
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,080
and you know how to interact with people.

453
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,160
That's your strength

454
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
so, why not use it.

455
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,440
Well, I think that's just remarkable.

456
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,680
So, if you look at the vision

457
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,800
a few years forward,

458
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,880
what's going to happen with ZoEasy

459
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,960
as far as you're seeing it?

460
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:24,440
Honestly, for me,

461
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,880
like five years down the line,

462
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,320
I want to make sure that

463
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,120
we help educate

464
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,760
and find ethical employment opportunities

465
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,640
for one million job seekers, at least.

466
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,000
And honestly, the aim is to become

467
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,480
the go to platform

468
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,760
for the migrant workforce.

469
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,360
We want to be that platform

470
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,320
that the migrant workforce can turn to,

471
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,360
especially in relation

472
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,400
to these specific fields.

473
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,200
And essentially,

474
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,680
what that contributes towards

475
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,520
more than anything

476
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,160
is helping people find

477
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,720
like attain economic empowerment.

478
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,200
Right?

479
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:58,880
When you attain economic empowerment,

480
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,560
you're reducing inequalities

481
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,640
in the community.

482
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,040
You're creating greater diversity

483
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,240
in the community,

484
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,280
and you're also having a ripple effect.

485
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,880
So, it's not just that one person

486
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,320
that you're impacting,

487
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,920
but you are actually impacting

488
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,040
five other people in their families

489
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,200
and creating a better

490
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,720
standard of living for them

491
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,880
and a better standard of living

492
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,920
for generations to come.

493
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,480
So, it's not just that one person

494
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,280
you're impacting, but it has

495
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,480
a ripple effect

496
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,440
across multiple generations.

497
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,680
I think that's wonderful.

498
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,840
And I want to spend more

499
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
time talking about ZoEasy,

500
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,520
but I also really want to gauge

501
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,000
your brain on the different

502
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,880
activities that you've done.

503
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,760
For example, the World Economic Forum

504
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,480
and the work that you're doing there.

505
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:38,760
Tell me,

506
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,040
how did you get involved with that

507
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,280
and what is the work that you're doing?

508
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,800
Honestly, it all comes down

509
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,880
to networking.

510
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,640
So, I've come to realize

511
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,160
that's a good trait to have.

512
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,560
If you know how to reach out

513
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,600
to the right people

514
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,640
and just basically

515
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,120
know how to get people engaged with you

516
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,600
and invest in you as a person

517
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,280
and also invest in your ideas.

518
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,520
Right?

519
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,880
So, I actually came across

520
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,360
the Global Shapers community

521
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,640
at One Young World,

522
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,360
which is another youth,

523
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,360
large youth network and organization.

524
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,760
So, I was a delegate speaker

525
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,800
at One Young World 2018 in The Hague.

526
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,680
And somebody

527
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,960
from the Global Shapers community

528
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,280
had seen me speak.

529
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,360
And so, we connected afterwards

530
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,000
and she told me

531
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,360
about this wonderful community.

532
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,920
And what I really like

533
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,800
about the Global Shapers community,

534
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,360
honestly, is the fact that

535
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,640
you have people,

536
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,320
you have young leaders,

537
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,480
but who come from

538
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,480
so many different backgrounds

539
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:37,920
and who have

540
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,480
so many different skill sets.

541
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,680
But you're all working towards

542
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,400
the same vision.

543
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,680
You all want to create

544
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,560
some form of social impact

545
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,760
in the community.

546
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,800
And the WEFs key pillars are focused

547
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,480
on education and employment,

548
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,560
equity and inclusion

549
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,520
and the environment.

550
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,120
So, these are the three main areas

551
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,480
that they look at, and these are all

552
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,400
three passion areas for me.

553
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,040
So, I joined the Global Shapers community

554
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,040
in early 2019, and I was actually

555
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,760
a part of helping one of their,

556
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,600
now biggest projects.

557
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,880
So, Global Shapers Dubai's

558
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,360
current biggest project

559
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,520
is with a foundation called

560
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,960
the Al Ghurair's Foundation for Education,

561
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,120
and they provide scholarships

562
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,240
to underprivileged youth

563
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,560
for universities.

564
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,240
And the person that was leading

565
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,440
this initiative at the beginning,

566
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,840
I had helped him assist

567
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,720
with putting out the first workshop

568
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,960
and taking them

569
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,480
through project management courses,

570
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,240
how to raise funding,

571
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,960
how to basically put your idea out there

572
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,200
and make sure that it grows.

573
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,560
Because practically, experience,

574
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,320
at the end of the day

575
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,720
is very different to

576
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,400
what you learn at university

577
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,240
or in a classroom. Right?

578
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,240
So, that was one

579
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,280
of the first education initiatives

580
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,280
that we've launched.

581
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,840
Now I'm the vice curator of the hub,

582
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,400
so, I'm also part of the leadership team

583
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,000
and helping manage it,

584
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,120
but also ensuring that more projects

585
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,240
are coming out in relation

586
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,680
to the other pillars as well.

587
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,200
And we actually did

588
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,960
a really cool initiative recently,

589
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,320
like we launched

590
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,040
something called the elevate series.

591
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,920
So, me and a fellow global shaper,

592
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,800
we're co-leading that together.

593
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,680
And we did a pilot

594
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,640
with an NGO in India.

595
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,240
And the idea was to basically provide

596
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,280
skills training around

597
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,640
building better resumes, presentations,

598
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,000
social media skills using CANVA.

599
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,520
And it was so interesting to see

600
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,080
over the span of two days,

601
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,360
we were able to reach 160 girls

602
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,760
in 23 countries.

603
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
And we never expected that.

604
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,040
So, I'm glad to see

605
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,880
that it is an initiative

606
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,240
that has the potential to grow

607
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,520
and create more sustainable impact.

608
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,440
And that's what I love about

609
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,400
the community as well.

610
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,160
Fantastic.

611
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,480
What are some nuggets of wisdom

612
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,320
that you can provide

613
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,440
for young entrepreneurs

614
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,720
that are just young people in general

615
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,784
that are looking to affect

616
00:18:53,785 --> 00:18:55,240
so called change, that are looking

617
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,400
to make an impact either

618
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
in their local community

619
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,240
or broader than that?

620
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,840
You know,

621
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,280
we humbly forgot to mention

622
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,200
that you were chosen

623
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,560
for Forbes 30 under 30

624
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,360
for the amazing work

625
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,040
that you're doing.

626
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,400
But I'd love to hear a little bit

627
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,920
about your insights as to

628
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,960
how other young people

629
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,720
can get involved

630
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,840
with similar initiatives.

631
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,960
Honestly, I feel like

632
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:17,920
if you are passionate about something

633
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,800
and you believe in your idea,

634
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,320
then first things first

635
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,200
is actually lay out a budget.

636
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,840
That's the first thing to do.

637
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,200
Put a budget down,

638
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,920
see if this is something

639
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,760
that can be viable.

640
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,240
Especially because, you know,

641
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,520
you do want to create impact

642
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,000
in the world,

643
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,920
but you also need to know

644
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,800
how to survive.

645
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,360
Without being able to survive,

646
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,280
you won't be able to affect that change

647
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,520
at a larger scale.

648
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,920
So, yes, start at the grassroots level,

649
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,240
but first things first,

650
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,640
lay down a budget.

651
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,040
See if this is a viable project,

652
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,800
see if there is a way to put it out,

653
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,200
and then create a good story around it.

654
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,080
Because, yes, you can talk numbers

655
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,800
and numbers are very important,

656
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,880
but in order to get people

657
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,040
to invest in you

658
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,240
and believe in your idea,

659
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,040
you also need to know

660
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,640
how to communicate your vision properly

661
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,600
to others.

662
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,080
So, I think it's very important

663
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,120
to kind of combine

664
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,560
those two skills together.

665
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,760
So, balancing storytelling

666
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,120
with the numbers that you have

667
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,360
in place that show that

668
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,000
this is a big problem out there

669
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,440
and there is a viable solution

670
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,800
which you want to provide.

671
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,880
And finally, I would say one in

672
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,600
first things first invest in yourself,

673
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,280
learn as much as possible.

674
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,040
I went in completely blind.

675
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,400
I was a first line entrepreneur.

676
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,200
I had no idea

677
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,640
how to do any of this stuff,

678
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,440
but I had a great set of mentors.

679
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,320
And honestly, because of them,

680
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,040
I've been able to come this far.

681
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,800
So, network, find yourself good mentors

682
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,960
who can guide you in the right direction

683
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,280
and do a lot of research

684
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,240
and start reaching out

685
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,240
to the right networks as well.

686
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,320
Because especially if you're

687
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,240
a young entrepreneur,

688
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,480
you want to meet people

689
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,080
that are also young entrepreneurs

690
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,120
that have gone along

691
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,800
a similar journey

692
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,240
and who understand the process

693
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,160
and who can guide you.

694
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,800
So, do your research,

695
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,600
get access to networks

696
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
like One Young World.

697
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,400
One Young World is a brilliant platform

698
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,680
for you to connect with young innovators

699
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,280
who are facilitating change

700
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,560
around the world.

701
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,000
So, reach out to networks

702
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,920
like One Young World,

703
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,800
reach out to networks

704
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,720
like the Global Shapers community.

705
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:18,280
Try to identify more networks

706
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,320
that you can be a part of

707
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,920
where you can connect with people.

708
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,360
Randomly cold call.

709
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,960
What's the worst that can happen?

710
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,000
I mean, somebody will say no, that's it.

711
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,160
It's okay if someone says no,

712
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,920
no problem.

713
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,400
Just move on to the next thing.

714
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,320
But keep them posted on what's happening,

715
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,160
obviously, because, one,

716
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,440
when you're company starts to grow,

717
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,240
it will be likely

718
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,080
that they will come back

719
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,440
and reach out themselves.

720
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,720
So, it may be a closed door now,

721
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,960
but it'll open up at a later stage.

722
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,240
So, don't be deterred

723
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,480
by a no in any way.

724
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,920
Frankly, I got so many no's in 2017,

725
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,040
but, and obviously there were

726
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,160
self-doubt moments as well.

727
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,040
I was like, oh my God,

728
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,480
am I doing this the right way?

729
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,360
I don't know what's going on.

730
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
But you know one yes

731
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,800
can really change the entire game.

732
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,000
I love that.

733
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,600
Spandana, thank you so much for being

734
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,880
so kind with your time.

735
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,400
This was really wonderful.

736
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,040
Before we leave,

737
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,280
I have to ask you the most difficult

738
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,800
and most important question,

739
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,040
which is three words

740
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,520
that we'd use to describe yourself.

741
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,960
That's a very interesting one.

742
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,120
It is a tough one.

743
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,480
That's like the most difficult one,

744
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,240
I would say.

745
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,760
Right.

746
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,680
I'm a people person.

747
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,920
So, very friendly, empathetic.

748
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,880
I am also very diverse as a person.

749
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,680
I know diverse

750
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,640
is not exactly like a proper adjective,

751
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,040
but I would say diversity is

752
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,840
a big part of me based on

753
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,960
so many different factors.

754
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,880
So, diversity.

755
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:55,680
And curious. I would say I'm curious.

756
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,320
Yeah, curious.

757
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,960
Thank you so much

758
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,840
for joining me here,

759
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,400
this was wonderful.

760
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,040
I can't wait to share this

761
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,880
with the world.

762
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,680
And I can't wait

763
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,240
to have more interaction

764
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,240
both between the nations,

765
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,840
but also maintaining this connection

766
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,400
and keeping open doors

767
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,080
and then potentially

768
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,040
working together sometimes.

769
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,440
So, thank you very much.

770
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:10,880
Thank you.

771
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,840
Thank you so much for having me.

772
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,920
Take care.

773
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,400
Bye.
