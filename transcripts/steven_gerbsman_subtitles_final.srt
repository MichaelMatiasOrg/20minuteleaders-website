114
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,960
All right. Wonderful.

115
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,200
Steven Gerbsman, thank you so much

116
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,240
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

117
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,200
My pleasure.

118
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,280
Really, really great to have you.

119
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,280
With 51 years of experience in crisis management,

120
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,840
as an investor, angel investor as well,

121
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,800
and really understanding how

122
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,160
to maximize the value of enterprises.

123
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,370
I'm so excited to learn with you

124
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,320
exactly what is crisis management.

125
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,680
And I'd love to spend the next

126
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,200
20 minutes getting to know you better

127
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,840
and gaining some insight that hopefully

128
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,840
one day as a seasoned entrepreneur,

129
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,680
I will have to confront a lot

130
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,120
of the lessons that you've already learned.

131
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,960
So, let's dig in. Who are you, Steven?

132
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,640
So, let me give you a little brief background.

133
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,880
My career started with the IBM Corporation.

134
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,880
I was president of four operating divisions

135
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,600
of a company called ITEL Corporation

136
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,320
in San Francisco,

137
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,920
which is in the computer ... business.

138
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,080
In the 80s and 90s,

139
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,200
I was a hands-on crisis turnaround CEO

140
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,800
being dropped in by equity or senior lenders.

141
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:15,960
Around 2000 when the internet -

142
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,410
What does that mean? Wait.

143
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,680
Steven, what does that mean

144
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,560
an interim CEO crisis turnaround?

145
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,720
Companies, let me turn it around.

146
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,880
Companies fail

147
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,480
and companies succeed

148
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,000
for different reasons.

149
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,680
Companies fail for three reasons:

150
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,440
lack of control,

151
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,240
preservation, and forecasting of cash.

152
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,120
Lack of control,

153
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,720
preservation, and forecasting of cash.

154
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,120
And lack of control,

155
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,440
preservation, and forecasting of cash.

156
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,760
It's all about cash.

157
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,200
It's all about cash.

158
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,440
You have management issues.

159
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,520
You can have market issues.

160
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,880
You can have gross margin issues.

161
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,320
You can have competition.

162
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,960
You can have FDA issues.

163
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:55,760
Doesn't matter.

164
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,760
If you have enough cash,

165
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,520
you can get through the process.

166
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,640
And boards of directors or senior lenders

167
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,720
focus on what happens in companies.

168
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,760
But let me take it to 19, around the 2000s

169
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,000
and I'll talk about,

170
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,480
because I think this is a thread here.

171
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,080
When the internet blew up,

172
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,760
we observed

173
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,480
that there were no hard assets.

174
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,240
It was intellectual property.

175
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,200
You had software,

176
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,280
you had medical device,

177
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,320
you had life science,

178
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,360
you had mobile, you had fuel cell

179
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,520
later on, you had solar.

180
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,240
So, there was a whole new industry

181
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,760
that grew up where your normal M&A process

182
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,800
really wasn't viable.

183
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,680
So, we got involved around 2000

184
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,280
with companies that had anywhere between

185
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,160
10 to 200 million dollars invested.

186
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,080
Okay.

187
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,320
And these companies,

188
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,240
again, something happened,

189
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,040
but it all revolved

190
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,320
around amount out of cash.

191
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,360
They were either senior lender companies or

192
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,360
they were venture private equity companies.

193
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,200
To the extent that what they needed to do

194
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,240
was find a way to go forward.

195
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,320
So, if the board or the bank

196
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,400
decided not to continue to invest,

197
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,000
which is all about cash,

198
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,160
what happens then?

199
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,680
So, you gotta maximize value

200
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,680
and relationship to the market.

201
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,120
So, we created a process called

202
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,840
the Date-Certain M&A Process

203
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,000
where we go to market in six weeks,

204
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,120
we maximize the value

205
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,400
of the intellectual property and assets.

206
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,948
We've done 109 deals.

207
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,423
109?

208
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:20,840
109 deals.

209
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,080
And to the extent that

210
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,840
we were able to save jobs,

211
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,000
save intellectual property that -

212
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,400
Steven I wanna just summarize

213
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,840
to make sure that I understood this correctly.

214
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,400
What you're saying is

215
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,440
if you have a company,

216
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,520
it has investments of historically

217
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,000
of 10 to 200 million.

218
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,840
Now, they've reached a point where

219
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,680
the investors, current or new,

220
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,600
are not interested in continuing along.

221
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,440
The company is now in a problem

222
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,680
because it's running out of cash.

223
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,680
It has assets.

224
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,960
It has intellectual property.

225
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,160
It has value.

226
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,040
It has value.

227
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,000
But now you're coming in

228
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,480
and you're saying,

229
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,520
"I want to help you maximize this value.

230
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,080
I'm gonna come in for six weeks

231
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,600
in and out

232
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
and I'm gonna maximize

233
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,200
the value of the assets you have

234
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,240
and I'm gonna try to save

235
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,690
as much as I can

236
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:01,200
of the value of your company"

237
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,000
Right?

238
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,560
I'm gonna try to save as much as I can

239
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,200
for the value for the stakeholders.

240
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,035
For the stakeholders.

241
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,600
Stakeholders are equity

242
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:12,040
creditors, senior lenders,

243
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,560
investors, all of the above. So basically -

244
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,560
Are employees’ stakeholders?

245
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,280
I would call employees stakeholders.

246
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,360
And when you go forward,

247
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,000
part of the objective

248
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,000
is it's hard for investment banks

249
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,360
to do these type of deals

250
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
because they get into

251
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,480
what I call M&A nirvana.

252
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,240
They get in reps of warranty issues.

253
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,280
You can go on forever.

254
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,800
You get letters of intent.

255
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,680
And that isn't the real world.

256
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,360
So, we go to customers, competitors,

257
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,040
strategics, VCs for their portfolio companies,

258
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,760
senior lenders.

259
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,240
We're branded worldwide.

260
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,800
We just did a deal in Israel.

261
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,080
We've done a couple deals in China,

262
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,720
Australia, obviously the US.

263
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,640
And the message is

264
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,960
the board has made a strategic decision.

265
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,120
They wanna go forward

266
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,880
and try to monetize and maximize value.

267
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,680
And why did the board do this?

268
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,880
Basically, they have a fiduciary responsibility

269
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,880
to all those stakeholders and creditors.

270
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,760
Right.

271
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,440
And to the extent, part of the challenge is,

272
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
there has to be enough money

273
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,120
in the company to run a process.

274
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,200
To pay us, to pay the employees,

275
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,440
to keep things going, etc.

276
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,440
What's happened over the years

277
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,480
after the debacle in '07 to '09 if you will,

278
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,600
is that senior lenders who represent

279
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,680
probably about 30% of our deals

280
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,640
that they're involved in,

281
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,640
made sure that they put covenants in

282
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,360
that there was enough cash to maintain

283
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,320
the operation to go forward.

284
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,120
But basically, the board has said,

285
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,640
"I wanna decide what we do to go forward.

286
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,600
We're not gonna put any more cash in.

287
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,680
We don't wanna do a hard shutdown.

288
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,120
We want to meet our fiduciary responsibilities."

289
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,680
So, we're an independent third party

290
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,360
that's able to go to the market,

291
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,600
find out what's going on,

292
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,680
and we basically send out a sales letter.

293
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,960
All due diligence is done

294
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,680
prior to the bid date.

295
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,560
We send out an asset purchase agreement.

296
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,280
We require a deposit.

297
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,640
Highest bid that conforms

298
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,440
to the asset purchase agreement wins.

299
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,520
Bids come in to me

300
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,400
so it's a closed process.

301
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,000
We've changed the dynamics

302
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,400
of power and control

303
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,040
where the bank is sitting their, investment bank,

304
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,600
and holding the company off to an LOI

305
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,040
or whatever one on one.

306
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,920
It's anybody can bid.

307
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,040
Highest bid wins,

308
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,240
and we go back and hondle on price

309
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,160
and all that stuff at the end.

310
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,240
And the company can either

311
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,240
accept or reject the deal.

312
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,520
Now the perception of value is always

313
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,850
in the eyes of the beholder.

314
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,960
And value is the market.

315
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,200
The market will determine value

316
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,040
because it isn't what people pay for it,

317
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,000
it's what people,

318
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,760
what it costs to get to the next step.

319
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,880
So, as I said, we've done 109 deals

320
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,000
very credible in that market, et cetera.

321
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,560
But let me give you some observations that -

322
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,360
By the way,

323
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,370
just to make sure I understand,

324
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,120
when you come into the picture,

325
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,760
it is understood by all parties

326
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,720
that this company is going to be

327
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,360
either merged or acquired.

328
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,800
Is that correct?

329
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,160
Well, it is understood

330
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,840
that we're gonna do

331
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,320
an asset sale

332
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,160
meaning the company

333
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,680
without its liabilities.

334
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,040
Meaning that the acquirer

335
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,640
can decide which people they want.

336
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,400
In all cases, the value of the IP and assets

337
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,640
or the company without its liabilities

338
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,240
is really related to the quality

339
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,480
and availability of the key intellectual capital,

340
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,920
which are the people.

341
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,560
And it really isn't the CEO,

342
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,040
really isn't the CFO,

343
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,480
it's the IP technology people.

344
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,240
The people who really work in these areas

345
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,360
that make sense.

346
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,760
The VP R&D, those roles are

347
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,360
When you invest in a $200 million,

348
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,800
half of our deals have been

349
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,560
in the medical device life science area.

350
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,240
All right.

351
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,040
Basically because

352
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,920
they bring the most return

353
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,800
and they can have a CE mark,

354
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,360
which is approval of Europe.

355
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,600
They can be in some form of FDA, etc.

356
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,000
But I want to take you to one area

357
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,120
that you sort of alluded to.

358
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,640
When we talk about

359
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,000
why companies fail

360
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,320
and why companies succeed

361
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,240
and young entrepreneurs,

362
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,280
the biggest frustration and challenge

363
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,680
for myself and my partners,

364
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,640
we're all like CEOs,

365
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,280
is that the board of directors

366
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,920
doesn't hold the CEO responsible

367
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,200
and accountable enough.

368
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,080
All right. I'm ready for this now. Yeah.

369
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,640
All right.

370
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,360
So you have venture capital,

371
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,560
you have senior lenders,

372
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,960
you have private equity.

373
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,760
A lot going on. When things are going well,

374
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,520
you're the CEO

375
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,080
you're king of the hill.

376
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,520
If you haven't been through a down cycle,

377
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,400
you don't know what to do.

378
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,480
CEOs will shut down.

379
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,160
They won't communicate.

380
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,480
We've been in situations where

381
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,400
everybody in the company

382
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,200
knows what's going on,

383
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,600
but the CEO is concerned

384
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,800
about communicating that,

385
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,360
which is the worst thing you can do.

386
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,680
Of course.

387
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,160
It's all about leadership,

388
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,920
motivation, morale,

389
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,640
communicate, communicate, communicate.

390
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,200
You tell people the truth

391
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,640
and it will free your soul,

392
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,760
but make it a lot easier

393
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,880
so you don't bulls**t anybody.

394
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:55,240
How often do CEOs are not

395
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,360
completely open with their board?

396
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,960
How many of the cases would you think?

397
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,120
Well, it isn't a matter of not

398
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,600
being open with the board.

399
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,840
It's a matter of either the board

400
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,080
not forcing issues sooner than later

401
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,760
because they see something's happening

402
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,160
and they're working on a leap of faith.

403
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,600
Or the CEO doesn't communicate sometimes -

404
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,840
But is this a common thing?

405
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,120
Is this a common phenomenon?

406
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,600
I would say, here's what's common.

407
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,120
What's common is at least 30 to 40%

408
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,240
of companies that we get into,

409
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,120
the CEOs have not been experienced enough

410
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,800
to know what to do. In other situations

411
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,640
they've been through it a couple of times.

412
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,480
You know, in cases it's a badge of honor

413
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,040
if you have a company doesn't make it

414
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,520
because you know what's going on and

415
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,320
you do the best you can.

416
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,960
But the real issue comes down to

417
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,160
when you get in crisis mode.

418
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,240
You need to communicate

419
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,400
to your employees,

420
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,360
to the creditors,

421
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,400
to your stakeholders,

422
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,560
to the senior lender,

423
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,080
to your vendors, to the market.

424
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,000
Okay.

425
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,720
And one of the issues that you find

426
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,720
if you are important to these people

427
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,080
and you're actually delivering product

428
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,200
with your intellectual property,

429
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,800
it's hard for them to go away.

430
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,800
So, you get creditors to support you

431
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,600
and they want to see something happen.

432
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:02,880
Right.

433
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,680
So, when we use the term,

434
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,880
"maximize the value of the intellectual

435
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,360
property and assets"

436
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,880
we're trying to find a home

437
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,880
that will take it to the next level.

438
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,000
Now, here's the waterfall.

439
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,720
The waterfall is when we do a deal,

440
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,600
then we get paid,

441
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,400
the lawyers get paid,

442
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,880
and management gets paid.

443
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,480
But the real people that come after that

444
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,000
are the secured creditors,

445
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,560
which is the lender.

446
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,400
And then you've got the unsecured creditors,

447
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,080
which are the creditors, the payables.

448
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,560
Equity rarely gets paid off in these deals.

449
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,400
But the real, the issue that you're doing is

450
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,920
you're meeting your fiduciary,

451
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,960
I used that word a number of times,

452
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,680
and if you're gonna ask me about

453
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,640
three words, I'm gonna give

454
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,840
you the three words right now:

455
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,880
Ethics, Integrity and Leadership.

456
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,640
Okay.

457
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
You go through life,

458
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,680
you don't sell your soul,

459
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,760
you tell people the truth,

460
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,640
and you get through it.

461
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,000
The hardest thing to do,

462
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,520
when we get involved,

463
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,720
my partners and I can go into

464
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,440
any company and in three days,

465
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,120
tell you what's going on.

466
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,720
And here's the profile.

467
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,720
If we sit down and a CEO doesn't let us talk

468
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,240
or we have a meeting with the CFO,

469
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,960
the CTO, the CMO, all the key executives,

470
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,520
and all that the CEO does

471
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,440
is tell us what's going on.

472
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,000
I know we got a problem

473
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,360
because the strong CEO is gonna say,

474
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,200
"CFO, tell me what's happened.

475
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,080
CTO, tell me what's happened.

476
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,280
CMO, tell me what's happening."

477
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,760
And you try to work the problem

478
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,520
in an open environment.

479
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,400
But again, it's not necessarily,

480
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,640
it's experience.

481
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,200
I mean, how old are you right now?

482
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,480
24.

483
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,240
God bless you.

484
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,160
You're the future and you give us hope.

485
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,800
Thank you very much.

486
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,920
Now, run your company at 27

487
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,680
but unless you've never been through it. So -

488
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,000
That's what I wanna know, Steven.

489
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,480
So, now it's time for some selfish request

490
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,640
because I want some advice from you.

491
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
I'm gonna run a company.

492
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,160
I'm very excited for that.

493
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,120
I hope I get to a point where my company

494
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,840
is big enough and strong enough.

495
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,680
And you know what,

496
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,200
I hope that we're gonna have to fight

497
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,520
some hurdles because I wanna learn

498
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,960
and I wanna experience.

499
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,120
What do I need

500
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,800
to keep in mind from day zero?

501
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't wanna reach a crisis

502
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and then ask you -

503
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,720
So, what you need to do from day zero

504
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,000
is the following, okay

505
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:13,280
One, you cannot lead if you haven't done.

506
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,440
Go make a sales call.

507
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,880
Call a vendor.

508
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,040
Go down to the manufacturing plant.

509
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,320
Meet the people.

510
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,000
Understand how to communicate to employees.

511
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,320
Close an order.

512
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,240
Talk to the senior lender.

513
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,920
Force people into a discipline

514
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,440
because it's all about respect,

515
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,400
but you don't get respect

516
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,600
until you really know what's going on.

517
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,520
The other thing is,

518
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,240
I told you the three

519
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,760
reasons why companies fail.

520
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,880
Start with putting in a discipline,

521
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,720
a bottoms up, go forward cash flow.

522
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,600
Not top down.

523
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,200
You see all these great spreadsheets

524
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,040
and I look at them when I come in.

525
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,440
Too late.

526
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,080
I say "This doesn't mean anything to me"

527
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,600
I need to understand what we have

528
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,840
is cash in the bank

529
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,640
and on a weekly basis,

530
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,640
what I'm spending,

531
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,360
why and how,

532
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,080
and what creditors I can push off or not

533
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,080
because I need to preserve control

534
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,880
and forecast cash.

535
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,480
Now, you're a healthy company.

536
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,840
You just got 10 million bucks.

537
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,040
Okay. You're feeling good.

538
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,280
Your best business partner

539
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,280
is your chief financial officer.

540
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,440
He or she.

541
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,040
You hold them responsible

542
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,200
and accountable

543
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,880
and you need to understand

544
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,280
the numbers.

545
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,560
Many, many years ago,

546
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,040
when I became a division president

547
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,160
of one of the groups at ITEL corporation,

548
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,920
the CEO came in and said,

549
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,840
this is before we had real spreadsheets,

550
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,120
"I want you to run

551
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,320
your business model with your hand

552
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,920
so you know everything that's going on"

553
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,920
Calling employees cost,

554
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
production cost,

555
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,880
cost of goods sold,

556
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,480
market,

557
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,600
you need to know the numbers.

558
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,680
So, it goes back to the fact

559
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,360
if you want to lead, you have to do.

560
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,360
And if you don't do, you can't lead.

561
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,560
So, understand your business.

562
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,360
The other thing is, it's all about

563
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,520
leadership, motivation and morale

564
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,840
and how you communicate to people.

565
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,440
You're in the business of,

566
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,790
you may wanna be liked,

567
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,200
but you need to be respected.

568
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,000
And people will respect you

569
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,680
if you tell them the truth,

570
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,480
if you tell them what's going on,

571
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,550
if you set reasonable goals.

572
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,640
Okay.

573
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,240
The other thing is,

574
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,400
is you need to learn how to sell up

575
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,400
meaning if I'm the VP

576
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,720
of finance or marketing,

577
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,720
I'm gonna sell up to you

578
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,590
about what's going on.

579
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,080
I wanna anticipate

580
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,030
what's happening.

581
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,310
Right.

582
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,440
You need to manage your board

583
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,520
because your board may not be managing you

584
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,320
because they got

585
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,480
10 other deals going on.

586
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,030
Right.

587
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,070
So, the first time you get a glitch,

588
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,030
I need help.

589
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,000
It takes a strong person

590
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,920
to say, "I need help."

591
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,600
What do I do?

592
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,590
What do you think?

593
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,110
Nobody's gonna question your ability.

594
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,070
I mean, after the third time you do it,

595
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,000
I may fire you.

596
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,400
But the first and second time,

597
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,720
I'm gonna give you enough rope.

598
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,270
Sure. Sure.

599
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,440
So, I mean, it sounds to me that

600
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,240
it all comes back then

601
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,480
to integrity and honesty

602
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,960
and being open and allowing myself

603
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,310
to hold myself accountable,

604
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,360
but also allowing others

605
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,720
to hold me accountable.

606
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,120
But it sounds like

607
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,320
unless you've gone through

608
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,480
these crises yourself,

609
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,280
it's really, really hard

610
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,080
to empathize with them

611
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,310
and to really understand.

612
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,880
Because I can see in the future,

613
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,720
three years down the line,

614
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,920
I go to my board meeting

615
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,810
and something doesn't work

616
00:18:17,814 --> 00:18:19,385
exactly like I think.

617
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,590
A board meeting is an hour long.

618
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,030
We do it once a month.

619
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,600
I'm gonna come in and I have nine other

620
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,800
incredible things I wanna say

621
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,680
that are just gonna help me

622
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,200
get my next round of investments

623
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,350
and gonna get me the next high five.

624
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,760
It's gonna take a lot of social,

625
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,160
a lot of personal responsibility

626
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,920
to get to say that one thing

627
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,160
that's not so nice. Right?

628
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,520
Look, I said it's about ethics,

629
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,160
integrity and leadership.

630
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,040
Those are the three words

631
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,880
you want me to end with.

632
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,680
I'm beginning with it.

633
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,560
I'm in the middle, I'm gonna end

634
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,320
with those same words.

635
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,030
I love it.

636
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,350
It's your responsibility to understand

637
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,550
how to sell and communicate. Okay

638
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,560
Now, because you're

639
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,270
the young entrepreneur,

640
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:57,760
you're gonna screw up

641
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,590
a couple times.

642
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,720
You have to.

643
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,270
But let me go back to the fact,

644
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,200
if you haven't done, you can't lead.

645
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,880
So, you can't, if you don't know

646
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,000
the financial numbers

647
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,520
or you don't know your gross margin

648
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,000
or you don't know the architecture,

649
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,800
resale, or the lead time to sell,

650
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,920
lead time to install,

651
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,680
lead time to close the sale,

652
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,400
lead time to get cash.

653
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,640
What your AR is

654
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,510
30 days, 45 days.

655
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,030
What's going on in payables.

656
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,640
What's going down

657
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,110
on the manufacturing floor.

658
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,400
You're in trouble. All right.

659
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,510
So, in good times,

660
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,200
everybody's having a ball.

661
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,000
Okay

662
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,640
And I've lived through now,

663
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,640
'87 to '89, '94 to '95,

664
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,510
'01 to '03, '07 to '10.

665
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,350
'12 to '14.

666
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,550
You know, this is different.

667
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,510
2020.

668
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,160
Why is this different? Why is this different?

669
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,000
Because it's the magnitude

670
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,520
where people are frozen

671
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,720
and they don't know what to do

672
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,720
meaning I have five proposals

673
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,560
out there right now.

674
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,720
I get calls from banks and equity.

675
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,400
And everybody has a leap of faith.

676
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,640
Hope that they shouldn't.

677
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,270
You have to,

678
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,280
I've always learned

679
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,920
that we're the last ones in

680
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,440
and everybody has that hope,

681
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,880
and you just play it out

682
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,440
and you bleed some more.

683
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,510
This cycle is very emotional.

684
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,000
And you sit here,

685
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,640
three months ago,

686
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,400
my partners and I discussed

687
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,360
the travel business,

688
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,680
the entertainment business,

689
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,310
the market coming back.

690
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
There's no way,

691
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,640
and we're now two and a half months later,

692
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,960
everybody thought it'd be great.

693
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,110
No way it's gonna happen.

694
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,680
It's gonna take a lot longer.

695
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,440
So, I encourage people to make

696
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,200
all the hard decisions now.

697
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,350
And I'll give you a different example.

698
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,510
Example is,

699
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,590
you have a prohibitive real estate lease.

700
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,960
You're a company that's doing revenue.

701
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,040
And you have, and this is an actual company,

702
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,880
it has 50 million bucks in the bank.

703
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,750
They're burning 10 million bucks a month.

704
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,400
They are gonna downsize,

705
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,000
but they have a contingent liability

706
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,830
of a real estate lease.

707
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,160
We've terminated and restructured about

708
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,120
$800 million of these problem

709
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,160
real estate leases.

710
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,590
$800 million. Wow.

711
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,880
What we tell people to do

712
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,480
is don't pay the rent.

713
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,000
Okay.

714
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,440
Go to the landlord and say,

715
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,920
"Hey, we need some help here."

716
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,760
And to the extent

717
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,000
that when we do this stuff

718
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,680
we gotta work something out.

719
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,720
And the landlord's gonna say,

720
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,720
"No. Pay the rent.

721
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,880
I'm gonna have my lawyer call you

722
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,680
and give you default"

723
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,560
And you're gonna say,

724
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,400
"I'm not gonna pay."

725
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,160
And that's going to cause

726
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,480
the landlord to do something.

727
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,720
Start spending money on lawyers,

728
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,830
creating havoc, etc.

729
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,800
And you're gonna sit there and say,

730
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,350
"We gotta negotiate."

731
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,160
Now where we were in '04 to '06,

732
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,320
this is the same timeline.

733
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,600
And I'll tell you the ultimate reason

734
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,960
why you do this, is that it took 18 months

735
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,350
to get before the courts then.

736
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,310
And basically, the worse you are,

737
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,030
the more leverage you have.

738
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,760
So, you do a contingent liability

739
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,040
liquidation analysis.

740
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,720
You show how bad it is.

741
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,560
And the worse you are,

742
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,110
you have more leverage.

743
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,830
You're playing poker.

744
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,760
You play the insolvency card.

745
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,360
All a landlord would get in an insolvency

746
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,880
is 12 months or 15% of the lease.

747
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,310
They may have two to four months

748
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,880
of letter accredited deposit.

749
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,590
You negotiate.

750
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,520
Because the problem is

751
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,880
they don't wanna wait that long

752
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,550
and you got time on your side here

753
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:10,920
Right.

754
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,480
Now the reason why you gotta do this

755
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
and I've had a number of companies

756
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,880
who should be doing it now

757
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,160
is five months from now

758
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,440
when you had that leap of faith

759
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,840
and you gotta go and raise

760
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,240
another 20 million,

761
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,480
you have this overhang

762
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,680
on your balance sheet.

763
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,480
And I'm gonna say,

764
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,240
"I'm not gonna give you 10 million bucks

765
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,840
when you got to 10 to $20 million

766
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,310
contingent liability out there"

767
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,070
Exactly.

768
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,320
So, a little different twist,

769
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,760
but it's all in the mental set

770
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,400
of how you run your business,

771
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,720
how you expect things to happen

772
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,310
and what happens going forward.

773
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,560
It sounds like more than anything,

774
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,440
you're coming in and you've seen

775
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,600
109 of these deals.

776
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,640
You have to come in with such resilience

777
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,400
and confidence that

778
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,640
because I mean, I'm assuming also that

779
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,680
the clients that are coming to you,

780
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,200
they're not in their happy state.

781
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,800
This is not a fun thing to do

782
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,720
that they're coming to you

783
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,480
to help when they're losing. Right?

784
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,920
So, you're sort of coming in

785
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,240
as their savior as sort

786
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,440
of like their -

787
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,600
Well, I woouldn't say their savior.

788
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,120
I'm coming in to maximize value.

789
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,400
We didn't create the problem,

790
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,720
we fix it, okay.

791
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,200
And you're not gonna call me,

792
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,720
if you call me as a CEO,

793
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,480
I'd take your call, I'd listen, etc.

794
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,800
But the only way you're gonna get to me

795
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,240
is the board told you to call me,

796
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,920
or the bank told you to call me.

797
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,790
All right.

798
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,280
And I'm gonna have credibility and say,

799
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,590
"Okay. Here's what the plan is.

800
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,550
And we're hired guns. We'll go in.

801
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,110
You gotta write a check to us like everybody else.

802
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,550
But we're the doctor on call"

803
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,040
So, interesting analogy.

804
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:37,600
I had, one of the proposals out is to a,

805
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,440
it's about $80 million invested

806
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,400
in a cancer development drug,

807
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,640
which is looking real good.

808
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,960
And they're out of money.

809
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,920
So, one of the board members

810
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,680
is a very high-profile surgeon.

811
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,480
So, he says to me,

812
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,600
"Well Steve, ... gotta do this

813
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,440
on a contingency. We'll help you out.

814
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,160
You'll make more in the back end."

815
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,640
I said, "No"

816
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,240
Look, I didn't create it.

817
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,350
We're here to fix it.

818
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,790
I'm the doctor on call.

819
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,600
If I go to you and say or you go to me and say,

820
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,040
"Okay, Steve, we're gonna

821
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,160
do some cancer surgery."

822
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,680
And I'm going to say,

823
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,920
"Okay, I only want to do something

824
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,720
and pay you if you do a good job"

825
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,280
You know whatever

826
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,000
So, we like the lawyers

827
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,840
and the other hired guns,

828
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,400
are cost of doing business.

829
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,880
So, our job is to make sure

830
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,520
we get the best value.

831
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,000
Move on.

832
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,640
And what happens in these cases

833
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:30,040
is that the creditors are able to at least

834
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,600
go through and hopefully work

835
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,200
with the new company.

836
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,480
The customers that are there

837
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,640
will be able to maintain

838
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,040
a flow that's in their system.

839
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,640
So, that's what we do.

840
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,040
Very very cool.

841
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,800
I mean, it's just a whole different world

842
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,160
that I had no idea   even existed.

843
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,880
And I mean, I'm sure that,

844
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,120
you have 109 different stories.

845
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,960
You shared a few here.

846
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,040
But I like you, the ones you shared, you have 109 more

847
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,160
than we didn't get to hear.

848
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,360
Steven, I need three words

849
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,280
that best describe you.

850
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,200
I already know what they are,

851
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,000
but I wanna hear it one more time.

852
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,640
Ethics, integrity, and leadership.

853
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,200
I love it.

854
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,640
Steven, thank you for the inspiration.

855
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,480
