1
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,840
Sharyn Abbott, thank you so much

2
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,720
for being on my show.

3
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,760
How are you today?

4
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,520
Wonderful. Thank you.

5
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,560
Sharyn, you had a dream

6
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,160
in the year about 2000, right?

7
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,400
To create something big,

8
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,160
to create something

9
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,320
really magical and impactful.

10
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,840
What was that dream?

11
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,960
I had been talking to my brother

12
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,400
at Christmas in December of 2000,

13
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,080
and we were talking about the fact that

14
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,800
he was adopted by my parents

15
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,200
and how many children in the US.

16
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,760
There's 200,000 children

17
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,960
who are living on the streets

18
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,000
without a parent or an adult

19
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,640
to help guide them or protect them.

20
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,840
200,000?

21
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,320
200,000 under 18 years old

22
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,200
with not a single adult

23
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,560
to take care of them.

24
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,360
And it broke my heart.

25
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,120
And so my brother Tony and I,

26
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,080
decided that we would do something

27
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,800
which is create a school for kids at risk,

28
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
to help get kids off the streets

29
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,120
from the United States.

30
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,200
And so, we were going to do

31
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,000
a little school, 350 kids.

32
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,080
350 boys.

33
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,480
Because at 15 years old,

34
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,760
there's no programs out there

35
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,120
for these kids.

36
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,840
There's programs for six year olds,

37
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,360
there's programs for 10 year olds.

38
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,200
People will take in a 10 year old,

39
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,280
but not a 15 year old.

40
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,360
So, we decided we would do something

41
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,920
to help get these kids.

42
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,560
They really need a break,

43
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,720
they really need somebody

44
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,200
to champion them.

45
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,240
And so, I started the process of,

46
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,360
let's create something.

47
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,640
And so, that became

48
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,040
Ultimate Business University, UBU.

49
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,280
And it's just a great acronym for

50
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,520
I want kids to learn

51
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,000
how to be themselves.

52
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,280
And then my brother passed away in 2008.

53
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,280
And before he passed away, I promised him

54
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,320
that I would make this school happen.

55
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,920
And because I had so much time,

56
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,040
I sold my house, my car,

57
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,760
my jewelry, everything,

58
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,200
and I went all in on an investment.

59
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,480
I have no home, I have no car,

60
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,680
I have nothing.

61
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,960
And what I have

62
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,360
is in a five by ten storage unit

63
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,120
and I am 100% invested

64
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,400
in making the school happen for kids.

65
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,760
And I am days away.

66
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,040
It could be tomorrow,

67
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,720
it could be Friday,

68
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,880
but I am days away

69
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,800
from having the investment mature

70
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,760
so that I can not only start a school

71
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,000
for 6,000 boys and girls

72
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,720
from the United States.

73
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,040
They will be moved to Belize

74
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,000
so a judge will interview them

75
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,680
and the judge will say,

76
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,880
you can go to juvenile hall

77
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,960
because you stole food

78
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,040
because you're hungry;

79
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,360
or you broke into a building

80
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,320
because you need to get out of the cold,

81
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,240
or you need to get out of the heat;

82
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,880
or you can go to police

83
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,200
and have a three year high school program.

84
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,400
And in 15 years old,

85
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,160
kids can be emancipated

86
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,360
and they can choose

87
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,280
what they want to do with their life.

88
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,680
So, we now will have

89
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,760
in a three year time period,

90
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,800
taking 500 boys, 500 girls

91
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,760
every six months,

92
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,320
move them to Belize;

93
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,520
and we have five judges

94
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,920
across the country;

95
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,120
and they will be able to have

96
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,920
the most progressive education

97
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,160
that will have trade school,

98
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,280
will have the required curriculum,

99
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,960
we will have auto mechanics,

100
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,280
we will have agriculture, horticulture,

101
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,160
we will have animal husbandry,

102
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,960
we'll have every practical skill there is

103
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,440
so that these kids will always know

104
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,440
that they can fend for themselves.

105
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,680
And we will do things

106
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,800
to bring them out of,

107
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,920
imagine living on the street

108
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,240
and having to survive.

109
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,680
And the differences

110
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,120
the kids have to develop

111
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,680
to survive, right?

112
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,800
So, we will help break down those defenses

113
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,440
so they get a chance to live their life

114
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,240
without having anger, abandonment issues,

115
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,720
all the things that come from

116
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,040
having to live on the streets

117
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,800
and be completely responsible

118
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,280
for your own life.

119
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,760
One boy I met was 12 years old.

120
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,360
He comes home from school,

121
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,320
his mother moved

122
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,520
and didn't even tell him

123
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,120
where she was going.

124
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,400
So, he has been on his own on the street

125
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,200
since he was 12 years old.

126
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,280
He's now 28,

127
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,840
remarkable young man,

128
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,960
he goes around the world

129
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,240
and he teaches people how to make farm

130
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,280
so that they can be self-sustaining,

131
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,200
creating food for themselves.

132
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,000
Imagine a young man doing that

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,480
because he was homeless

134
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,000
and he feels so much for people

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,960
who can't take care of themselves.

136
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,280
So, that's the dream.

137
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,040
And we are within days,

138
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,040
I have 165 people on my team

139
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,880
from 38 countries.

140
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,120
We have everything

141
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,720
from the agriculture, horticulture.

142
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,760
We have people,

143
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,280
my farm director is from Dublin, Ireland.

144
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,760
I have, my landscape architect

145
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,920
is from Turkey.

146
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,200
I have a shipping director

147
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,160
who is from Mombasa.

148
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,880
I mean, it is so incredible.

149
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,600
I have people like my COO, Tom,

150
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,360
built the Civic Center in Las Vegas,

151
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,640
nine billion dollar project.

152
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,720
And he wants to walk away

153
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,480
from this corporate construction world

154
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,280
and come and help

155
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,960
bring this project to life.

156
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,040
I have spent four years

157
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,880
trying to connect with people

158
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,840
who are in Shanghai

159
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,280
who have a company called Winsome.

160
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,600
And four months ago, my guy from India,

161
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,880
who is also part of the farming,

162
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,720
he connected with the branch in Nigeria,

163
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,520
and two days ago,

164
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,960
I got the final agreement

165
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,400
that we're going to partner

166
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,640
that we will be able to use 3D printing

167
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,000
to build the school.

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,160
400,000 square feet,

169
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,520
six storey buildings in one week,

170
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,320
inhabitable in four weeks.

171
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,640
We can build 10, 15,

172
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,120
100 square foot homes a day,

173
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,400
inhabitable in four weeks.

174
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,320
So, we are taking

175
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,120
the idea of construction.

176
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,120
We will have the first 3D printed town

177
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,640
where there will be 27,000 residents

178
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,840
after we have the three year high school,

179
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,520
the four year university

180
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,760
and all the people

181
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,040
that it takes to survive.

182
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,760
Our own town

183
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,760
where we will create this,

184
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,840
I call it Neotopia, the new utopia,

185
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,480
the way people want to live.

186
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,120
So, you don't have to lock your door;

187
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,160
you trust the people

188
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,760
that you live next to;

189
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
that you can walk around.

190
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,600
It's a town so you can walk around

191
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,920
and feel perfectly safe,

192
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,040
your kids are safe.

193
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
You don't have to worry

194
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,360
about somebody taking advantage of you.

195
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,640
This is the way the world should be.

196
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,600
This is our own Neotopia,

197
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,440
the way we want the world to be.

198
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,080
And it starts in Belize

199
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,000
and then we will expand to 24 countries

200
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,440
within 12 to 15 years.

201
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,440
So, it's a big big project.

202
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,200
Sharyn, a lot of people

203
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,800
talk about their dreams

204
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,680
and about their aspirations and goals.

205
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,160
You're starting off with Christmas,

206
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,520
I guess, 20 years ago, with a dream.

207
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,880
I'm very sorry to hear

208
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,960
that your brother passed away.

209
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,200
But I can only imagine the impact

210
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,400
that you're having

211
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,920
and you're going to have

212
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,280
on so many thousands of lives.

213
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,600
Not just the impact, by the way,

214
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,760
that it will happen

215
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,240
when the project comes to fruition,

216
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,720
they're actually there.

217
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,720
But I was tearing up here,

218
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,120
listening to the story

219
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,200
of how you founded this

220
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,960
and how this is going to touch

221
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,520
so many thousands of youth.

222
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,200
And I think about

223
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,440
a lot of youth that I see.

224
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,600
We're talking here about kids

225
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,400
who really have very little,

226
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,280
very unfortunate upbringing

227
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,440
in their surroundings.

228
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,880
Yeah, they have nothing.

229
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,040
And what amazes me is,

230
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,720
we think about the United States,

231
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,280
you know the United States

232
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,360
has only three countries

233
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,760
that are worse than we are here in the US

234
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,520
for kids dying of malnutrition

235
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,800
before they're two years old?

236
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,480
I mean, this is inexcusable.

237
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,200
I mean, we have one in five adults

238
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,720
goes to bed hungry every single day

239
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,960
in this country.

240
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,640
And I just did the math

241
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,760
a couple of weeks ago

242
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,960
because somebody made this comment

243
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,080
that the United States is so big,

244
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,840
that the whole world population

245
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,760
could fit into the United States.

246
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,520
If every person in the world,

247
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,960
eight and a half billion people

248
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,480
lived in the United States,

249
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,800
every single person

250
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,600
would have a quarter of an acre.

251
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,840
And yet, what?

252
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,600
People are homeless,

253
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,440
people have no food,

254
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,320
people have no education,

255
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,800
they have no power,

256
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,080
they have no running water,

257
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,960
what is the excuse for that?

258
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,000
So, we will have 28 divisions

259
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,760
that address those issues

260
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,360
all over the world.

261
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,520
So, one of our first projects

262
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,560
as we're building the school

263
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,160
is called Little Syria.

264
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,920
And we will take a million people

265
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,400
who are in Syrian refugee camps

266
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,960
and move them to a brand new land,

267
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,400
3D print their entire country.

268
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,920
So, four buildings

269
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,240
that are 400,000 square feet,

270
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,440
that's the infrastructure.

271
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,480
We can house a million people

272
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,720
in just two months.

273
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,400
Then we end up building their homes,

274
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,720
with 10 printers

275
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,160
we can build a hundred homes a day.

276
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,600
We will teach them to be self-sustaining,

277
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,080
they will never have to worry

278
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,480
about another country or other people

279
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,520
coming in to try to take over.

280
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,040
They will be completely taken care of,

281
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,320
but taught to take care of themselves.

282
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,120
And why hasn't this happened before?

283
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,280
The oldest refugee camp is in India, 1983.

284
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,480
The oldest refugee camp.

285
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,560
The UN has the resources.

286
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,480
Why does that still exist?

287
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,800
And I'm not even going to tell you

288
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,320
the travesties that go on there.

289
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,280
Because it is heartbreaking,

290
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,800
it is disgusting,

291
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,840
it is not human to treat people this way.

292
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,280
So, when we look at

293
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,440
how the world has changed

294
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,840
and thank goodness at your age,

295
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,640
you're not aware of some of the things

296
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,280
that have happened in the world.

297
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,920
But we're in an age

298
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,360
where there are a lot of us

299
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,920
who are now going to step up and make sure

300
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,680
that these things never happen again.

301
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,000
So, within five years, no hunger.

302
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,240
Did you know that 100,000,000 a year

303
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,880
eliminates hunger around the world?

304
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,360
Not one person would ever go to bed hungry

305
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,840
with $100,000,000 a year.

306
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,760
Did you know that the Nobel Peace Prizes,

307
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,080
the awards are paid for

308
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,680
through the platform

309
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,720
that was started after World War Two?

310
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,840
If somebody put 100,000,000

311
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,320
on a platform

312
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,200
and dedicated that to world hunger,

313
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,760
there could be no hunger anywhere.

314
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,040
So, we will do that.

315
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,920
Since nobody else is bothered,

316
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,320
we will do that.

317
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,160
So, how many things can be addressed

318
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,240
by somebody just being aware of it?

319
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,200
Why are people homeless?

320
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,440
Why is it in California

321
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,760
where you are, where I am?

322
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,040
There are no institutions

323
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,240
since Reagan was governor

324
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,320
to take care of people

325
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,800
who have mental disorders.

326
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,560
That's where a lot of our homeless

327
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,040
come from, because there's no places

328
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,440
for them to live.

329
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,400
So, what if we create

330
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,360
an environment, a camp

331
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,560
for these people to go

332
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,120
to feel like they're outside,

333
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,880
to feel like they have the freedom.

334
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,120
But they have to do things

335
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,040
to be self-sustaining.

336
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,600
But to create an environment

337
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,120
where they don't feel threatened,

338
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,400
and if you go north, to Oakland,

339
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,000
now, I made myself do this

340
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,080
because I see a problem

341
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,000
and I put myself

342
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,440
in the center of the problem

343
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,040
because were I'm in the middle of it,

344
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
I get really creative.

345
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,840
So, I'm walking around Oakland

346
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,520
a year ago, November,

347
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,000
and I have to walk around

348
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
three feet of trash everywhere,

349
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,080
all along Broadway

350
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,720
which is a beautiful area.

351
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,040
When Jerry Brown was governor

352
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,040
and when he was mayor of San Francisco,

353
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,840
he made these areas really beautiful.

354
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,400
He took them out of this impoverished area

355
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,680
and he made them absolutely gorgeous.

356
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,560
Well, they're just trash now.

357
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,760
Weeds up to your waist, trash everywhere,

358
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
homeless people.

359
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,360
I walked up Broadway

360
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,440
and had a homeless guy bump into me

361
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,720
and he yelled at me

362
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,480
because he hit me from his right side

363
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,400
and he's blind in his right eye.

364
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,720
Like I'm supposed to know this?

365
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,560
And it's like, why isn't somebody

366
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,720
taking care of this man.

367
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,600
Why is he living homeless on the streets?

368
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,280
And why does he feel

369
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,840
like he has to be so defenseless?

370
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,960
It's inhumane how we treat people.

371
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,320
We treat animals better

372
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,040
than we treat a lot of human beings.

373
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,400
We look at veterans.

374
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,200
The idea of somebody going off,

375
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,400
you've been there,

376
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
you go serve the military

377
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,400
and you come home and you have nothing.

378
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,440
But maybe you have shell shock,

379
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,320
maybe you have PTSD.

380
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,280
And there is a young man

381
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,120
who played for the Oakland Raiders

382
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,720
and I worked with him 15 years ago,

383
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,720
and he has PTSD and he can't hold the job.

384
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,640
But he also played

385
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,400
for the Oakland Raiders.

386
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,560
So, there's a dichotomy there

387
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,320
that doesn't make sense.

388
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,520
Like why hasn't somebody said,

389
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,640
"Okay, you don't have to be on the edge

390
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,040
all the time and scratching every day

391
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,320
for your survival."

392
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,400
"What else could you do?"

393
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,280
So, I came up with a program

394
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
where I'd said,

395
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,400
"Why don't you go out

396
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,640
and interview all the people

397
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,040
you played football with,

398
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,240
create an audio program,

399
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,960
and then go out and speak

400
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,880
in front of high school students

401
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,640
and then be able to sell this."

402
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,840
These are the famous

403
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,360
famous football players.

404
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,080
He didn't have the wherewithal to do that.

405
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,720
So, I said,

406
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,480
"I'll do the interviews."

407
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,240
He didn't have the wherewithal

408
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,480
to be able to give me their names.

409
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,800
And he is a well known ex football player.

410
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,480
People are left at the wayside.

411
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,440
There's one person who played

412
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,800
from the Oakland A's,

413
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,920
at the same time,

414
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,720
another person did Vida Blue,

415
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,600
and makes $10,000

416
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,760
every time he speaks publicly.

417
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,040
The other person he worked with, Mike,

418
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,520
who was on the Oakland A's

419
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,600
at the same time, he's on disability.

420
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,200
He had eight back surgeries

421
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,480
because of baseball.

422
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
He has nothing.

423
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,160
Why is there such a disparity

424
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,680
in the way they live their lives?

425
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,640
Sharyn, I have to say that

426
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,880
from what we're talking about here,

427
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,680
first of all, I completely agree,

428
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,000
these are awful issues.

429
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,480
And I'm very inspired by the way

430
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,640
that you're approaching them.

431
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,720
And you're not just saying

432
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,240
there are issues,

433
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,120
but you're also putting yourself

434
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,920
in the center of them

435
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,200
and thinking creatively

436
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,360
how to address them.

437
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:55,960
One of the things

438
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,800
that I'm taking for myself

439
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,520
as an entrepreneur and on my journey,

440
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,880
talking about back to the school

441
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,080
that you're creating

442
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,120
and talking about the Syrian refugees,

443
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,320
a million refugees

444
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,440
and building a sustainable community

445
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,320
for them to live

446
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,440
in a matter of weeks or months,

447
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,560
it's unbelievable.

448
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,840
And a lot of it is because of technology

449
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
and because of innovation,

450
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,880
this idea that you can 3D print

451
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,360
a community or a school.

452
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,920
I mean, that's exactly why I came

453
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,280
to the Bay Area after my service.

454
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,040
And that is exactly

455
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,280
why I started this show,

456
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,760
it's to gain perspective

457
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,360
on what are the different ways

458
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,800
that us technologists

459
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,560
can leverage deep technology

460
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,840
and interesting technology

461
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,480
to impact the lives of people

462
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,040
for the better.

463
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,560
And a lot of people can say

464
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,000
one way to do that is through

465
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,560
better digital transformations

466
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,760
on our own computers screens.

467
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,400
Another way could be

468
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,920
to actually go and build cities

469
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,720
and build schools and share.

470
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,440
What you're talking about here

471
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,360
is literally saving lives.

472
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,640
And I'm getting so much

473
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,000
inspiration from these stories.

474
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,360
Sharyn, obviously the things

475
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,560
that you're doing now are incredible,

476
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,480
they're completely inspiring.

477
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,440
You have an incredible background

478
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,400
of working with tech companies and tech.

479
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:05,960
You've mentioned that

480
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,840
you've also lectured at Stanford

481
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,720
quite a few times.

482
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,440
You were on Oprah Winfrey

483
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,960
talking about your projects.

484
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,160
So, talk to me a little bit about

485
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,360
where you came from,

486
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,400
what excited you throughout your career.

487
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,320
We don't have much time left,

488
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,640
but I'd love to hear a little bit about

489
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,240
who Sharyn Abbot is.

490
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,360
So, I grew up in a very small town.

491
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,720
There were 10,000 people

492
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,360
in 10 square miles.

493
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,560
And we grew the food that we ate

494
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,960
and we traded for what we didn't grow.

495
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,560
And you never locked the door.

496
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Everybody knew who you were.

497
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
Everybody watched out for each other.

498
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,720
And to me, that's the way

499
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,080
the world should be.

500
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,600
It was hard for me to adjust

501
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,760
to being in a world that wasn't like that.

502
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,720
And so I'm looking to bring my world,

503
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,520
my sphere of influence back to that.

504
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,000
Where people are happy every day

505
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,360
doing what they love to do

506
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,440
and not doing the job

507
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,760
just because they have to survive.

508
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,560
Where I grew up,

509
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,480
one person in the family worked

510
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,640
and everybody was able to survive

511
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,800
and do well.

512
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,680
Today, two people in the family

513
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,480
have to work

514
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,240
and the children never see their parents.

515
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,120
So, in the United States,

516
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,040
children under 12 years old,

517
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,200
65% never see their parents

518
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,560
other than on the weekends.

519
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,920
To me, that's wrong.

520
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,040
We should not put people in that position.

521
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,320
So, how do I take

522
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,840
the things that I loved about growing up

523
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,720
in the middle of Mendocino,

524
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,600
in the town of Mendocino,

525
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,040
three and a half miles inland

526
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,400
with 80 acres of state forests

527
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,120
surrounding me, to the point where

528
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,560
we were free, we had fun,

529
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,800
we knew what fun was, basic fun.

530
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,960
And today, kids don't know so much

531
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,320
about that because they're glued

532
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,720
to a computer screen.

533
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,000
They're playing games all the time.

534
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,120
I look around and I think,

535
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,000
what are people missing out on.

536
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,240
What inspired me, I was very fortunate,

537
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,920
I had dyslexia, I stuttered,

538
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,120
I had teachers

539
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,080
that pulled me aside and said,

540
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,360
"If you do this,

541
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,200
then this will be the result."

542
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,240
My sophomore year in high school, I said,

543
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,560
"I need to go to college."

544
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,400
And each one of my teachers said,

545
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,840
"Here's your assignment."

546
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,960
And I graduated with a 3.8,

547
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,720
when my sophomore year

548
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,840
I started out with a 2.0.

549
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,840
The teachers made the difference.

550
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,520
And because I have always seemed

551
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,360
to attract people to come into my life,

552
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,160
to inspire me, to help me, to guide me,

553
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,760
I've had amazing mentors in my life,

554
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,360
I have people that have opened up doors,

555
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,920
I have managed to be on a sales team

556
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,840
for a Fortune 500 company,

557
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,400
I've had my own companies,

558
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,440
I taught entrepreneurial skills

559
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,200
for 20 years only because

560
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,880
the Chamber of Commerce in Walnut Creek

561
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
asked me to run a group

562
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,600
and because people didn't like

563
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,360
what was happening in the chamber,

564
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,520
they asked me to run a group outside.

565
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,200
And then for 20 years,

566
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,680
that became a passion of mine,

567
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,120
to help people find out

568
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,760
what is the right path

569
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,960
for anybody who has a passion

570
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,600
in their business.

571
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,680
How do you do it more effectively,

572
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,720
more profitably, more easily,

573
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,520
so you can spend time with your family

574
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,080
and not spend all your time working,

575
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,920
to me, that's what's important.

576
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,760
I used to tell people

577
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,600
and I don't even know

578
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,560
where this came from,

579
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,160
but I didn't create it,

580
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,760
"You're born and then you die,

581
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,560
and your life is the dash

582
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,920
between those years."

583
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,000
What is the dash stands for?

584
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,560
So, I was born in 1950,

585
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,160
I'm 70 years old.

586
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,080
I have lived an amazing life,

587
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,760
I have accomplished amazing things,

588
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,560
I have 10 books published,

589
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,400
I have my pilot's license,

590
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,760
I used to autocross race cars,

591
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,360
I had downhill ski race won,

592
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,800
first place medals, downhill skiing.

593
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,360
I have conquered all the things

594
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,640
that to me, they were important.

595
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,360
I, today, I can still press

596
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,560
175 pounds with my legs

597
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,160
at 70 years old in November.

598
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,720
I mean, I am such trained

599
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,040
because I never saw obstacles.

600
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,160
I saw a challenge that I could overcome.

601
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:44,760
So, to me, every challenge has a solution.

602
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,200
And when people acknowledge

603
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,840
that, yes, there's challenges in life,

604
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,600
but that's saying about

605
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,000
it's not how many times you fall down,

606
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,280
it's how many times you get up.

607
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,920
That's been my life.

608
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,000
I have managed to overcome things

609
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,520
that most people can't even imagine.

610
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,480
I had five times in 12 years

611
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,000
medical doctors told me

612
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,040
I would not live six months.

613
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,120
The last time was in 2012

614
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,800
when I went through breast cancer,

615
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,680
kidney failure, liver failure,

616
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,800
all because of a doctors mistake.

617
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,040
I'm here.

618
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,640
I'm here to inspire other people,

619
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,800
I'm here to make sure that people realize

620
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,080
the world they live in

621
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,400
is the world they create.

622
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,040
So, we are not subject

623
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,120
to anyone else's beliefs

624
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,640
unless we choose to be.

625
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,120
So, whatever you want

626
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,320
to conquer in your life, it is possible.

627
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,880
Think about the first person

628
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,680
who ran a four minute mile.

629
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,520
Prior to that, it wasn't possible.

630
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,840
Now, how many people

631
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,600
have run the four minute mile?

632
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,920
So, how many things

633
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,320
could people accomplish

634
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,640
if they only realize,

635
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,120
if somebody else has done it

636
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,440
you can to.

637
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,080
Maybe if nobody's done it, you can.

638
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,160
How many times did it take

639
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,560
for the first space shuttle

640
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,680
to reach the moon?

641
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,480
They had to alter the course

642
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,640
a 1,025 times with the brilliance

643
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,360
of all those scientists at NASA

644
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,080
guiding that spaceship.

645
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,160
So, who are we to argue

646
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,000
with whatever you want to do

647
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,040
you can accomplish.

648
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,840
No matter what it is in the world,

649
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,440
there are no impossibilities.

650
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
There's limitations

651
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,920
that we put on ourselves.

652
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,480
And that's what I want the school to be,

653
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,600
is a shining example that these kids

654
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,360
who have been discarded, thrown away,

655
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,400
living on the streets by themselves,

656
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,040
have a chance to live their life

657
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,280
in such a way that they could accomplish

658
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,400
anything they choose.

659
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,160
And people like you,

660
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,880
you're able to go to Stanford,

661
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,480
how fortunate you are.

662
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,600
There's no limit

663
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,360
to what you can accomplish.

664
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,880
You think about Tesla's technology.

665
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,800
They're going to be so many releases

666
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,880
of Tesla's technology.

667
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,820
We're going to see so many things

668
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,760
become available that most of us think

669
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,160
it's just Star Trek technology, right?

670
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,320
No.

671
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,440
Things are real.

672
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,960
Things that we're going to see

673
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,040
coming out in the next few years,

674
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,720
we are going to be amazed

675
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,160
at what's happening.

676
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,360
So, stay in touch, do your own research.

677
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,120
Don't believe

678
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,280
what somebody else tells you.

679
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,600
Don't believe what I say

680
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,200
just because I say it.

681
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,120
But go out

682
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,000
and take that responsibility for yourself.

683
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,040
Don't listen to mainstream media

684
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,780
and think that

685
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,560
hat's the only opinion there is.

686
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,960
You don't read a book and think that

687
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,480
that is the last word,

688
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,000
because you have to make up your mind.

689
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,240
The beauty of living this life

690
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,240
is that we all get to choose

691
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,720
how we live it,

692
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,360
where we live it, what we do.

693
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,120
And you cannot go back at 70 years old

694
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,560
and redo what you did at 25.

695
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,360
So, every year counts.

696
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,120
And I am a living example

697
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,480
of embracing every single challenge

698
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,880
I've ever had and hitting it head on

699
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,040
and realizing that no matter how difficult

700
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,600
the challenge is,

701
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,760
there is a way to get through that

702
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,680
and be able to make a difference

703
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,960
in this world.

704
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,600
And I think

705
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,120
that's what all of us strive for.

706
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,440
Michael, it isn't what we do

707
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,720
behind closed doors,

708
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,680
it's what we do to influence people.

709
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:52,120
Like a good word, a helping hand.

710
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,880
I try still every single day

711
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,360
to have one thing

712
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,520
as a good work that I do,

713
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,960
whether it's opening the door

714
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,760
for an old man

715
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,520
that would never expect a woman

716
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,880
to open the door,

717
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,040
or helping somebody with their packages,

718
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,400
or it doesn't matter how little it is.

719
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,960
But to inspire somebody

720
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,240
by complimenting them

721
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,200
or making them laugh,

722
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,440
we can make the world a better place,

723
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,800
one person at a time, one day at a time.

724
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,000
And that's what this is all about.

725
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,880
Sharyn, that is just inspiring.

726
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,560
And I am so thankful

727
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,480
for the fact that

728
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,560
you're so generous with your time,

729
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,760
so thank you very very much.

730
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,840
Before we end,

731
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,920
and I'm very very sad that we have to end,

732
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,760
but before we have to end,

733
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,360
I need three words that you would use

734
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,240
to describe yourself.

735
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,280
Innovative, determined, and creative.

736
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,360
Sharyn, thank you very very much.

737
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,360
This was just wonderful.

738
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,520
Stay safe and stay healthy.

739
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,320
And I cannot wait

740
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,560
to share this with the world.

741
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,280
I can't wait to

742
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,040
come visit the school myself

743
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,320
and all the different communities

744
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,640
that you are talking about.

745
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,000
And I can't wait

746
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,080
to continue following your journey.

747
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,120
