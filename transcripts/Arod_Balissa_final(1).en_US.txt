1 The one thing I can say about my journey that I didn't plan for any of this. In fact, I was quite resistant at the beginning. Arod Balissa, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Thank you for having me. It's wonderful to have you. And it's going to be wonderful to talk about your different entrepreneurial endeavors. A lot of them are social, a lot of them are community. I think that if I look at the different things that you've done along your career, perhaps besides the legal stuff, we're looking at a pretty comprehensive list of activities that are very much involving the community, particularly that of the ecosystem in Israel. So Arod, tell me a little bit about your journey, leading all the way up to being to managing Deloitte Catalyst in Israel for startups? Well, you know, I guess the one thing I can say about my journey that I didn't plan for any of this. in fact, I was quite resistant at the beginning. It started, I'd say Wize started about 10 years ago. I think it was 2011. And I was just out of the army after three years at 8200. And there was this thing, the Facebook was just starting to share, to let you tag people in things. And I remember that I was very bent on sharing things with people like TED talks and stuff like that. And the thing wouldn't let me tag more than six people. So, I created the group and hope that if we have about 30, 40 people that I know and would, you know, would not block me or unfriend me. And it kind of took a life of its own. I'd say, it quickly grew to like a 500, 700 people group that was pretty active at the time. And, you know, I'm not going to walk you through the entire group history because it doesn't really matter. But it was on that venue that a bunch of us have decided to create an event for that community. I think the idea was originally by the shows friend, Guy Katsovich. He came to us, he came to me and few of the people and said, "Hey, why don't we have a community event?" I thought it was a good idea. You know, we did it. It was quite successful. And then I remember one time, Guy paid me a visit and said, "Hey, I've got this offer to you to do this at the bar let's say every once in two weeks." And my immediate reaction was, it was never going to work. You know, I'm thankful that he has beg to differ. But you know, the thing was that I wasn't really sure that would work and that we should do it. And 10 years later, I can tell you that I am very happy that I was wrong. And I think, one of the things that since then and actually even before that I have characterize my approach is that, I try to listen and let myself be wrong. It's a hard thing to do. And I know a lot of people, you know, talk about failures and being wrong. Here, it wasn't a failure. I think, generally speaking, it was a success. But I was wrong. I thought that there's no way it would work and it kind of it did. Not kind of. I mean, Wize, over the years has had hundreds of events impacting thousands of people. I mean, it's been a huge success, to say the least. Yeah. You know, I completely agree. And it has transformed into something that is a critical part of my identity. And I'd say that, but I always whenever I'm asked about it, I always start with the fact that I was at the beginning, I never thought it would work. And I mean, to this day, I'm really not sure why it still does But I think I am, we are fortunate that it still does and that people in Israel are very excited about the things we do and about the events and the content we bring. But, you know, I guess the first few years of Wize kind of gave me the confidence that I needed in order to do more things or more endeavors. And I think one of the things that changed about me the most is that I kind of realized that if it won't work, it'll be fine. I mean, you know, the term we like to use in Israel is fail fast, fail often. And I think part of my, one of my strategies was or one of my strategies till this very day is, okay, I mean, fine, if it won't work, it won't work. We'll just, you know, pick up the debris and move forward. And I think it has been the kind of like a cornerstone of the way that I approach new things. And it's not easy. Emotionally, it's not easy for me. And I think I'm a relatively conservative person at nature. And I keep trying to push myself into new things because, you know, because it has proved that to be a generally good strategy. Right. So, once we move past Wize. You've implemented the same mindset into all the different endeavors that you've done. So, talk to me a little bit about them. And how did you bring that mindset to develop these? Again, I think, so, we did learn a lot at Wize. All of us. All the people who were involved and all the people who are still involved, we learned so much. So much about, anything from operations and making sure that things run on time, and all the way up to leadership. We incorporated a nonprofit, I'd say in 2012 or something as a [--], an association. And, you know, we when you form an association, you have to have a board of directors. But really, when you are a five to 10 people operation, it really doesn't matter. And especially when you are 22 or 23. I didn't realize what it meant to be a board member and it didn't really mean anything at the time. But I think as we grew and as I've spent more time doing, you know, doing the work in the first few years and then kind of transitioning to leading to managing individuals and what is now teams, you know, I think I've learned a lot in terms of what does it mean to manage, what does it mean to lead. And in a way I think that we kind of grew or at least the people who are now on the board, we kind of grew into the role. And I think that today, if I think about it, the thing that was most impactful is to know how to take a step back and also bring other people in. Trust the delegate effectively. Work with them, in some cases even mentor them and really letting other people share that thing that we've created about 10 years ago. Right. So, it's not just the community that's the customer base or the people that are using the product or leveraging the association and the non-profits work, but it's also internally the people that are running it. And, of course, I'm assuming that when you were discussing non-profits and these sorts of associations, you need the people there to, first of all, be very in, right? You need to really lube them in, you need to really make it a community primarily because this is a non-profitable work. And the motivations for volunteering their time at a non-profit work are very, very different than being a board member of a for profit startup, perhaps. \Right? 100%. I think that in a nonprofit, you know, the internal motivations are almost all you have. I mean, in a for profit organization or in a startup, it's always a mix between the money and the compensation and the internal motivation, which is very important. If you want to have an A-team, then you definitely need that. It's just that in a nonprofit, that's pretty much all you got. And when you're already dealing with volunteers, especially. And I think that the key idea is to help people find meaning in their work. And that's really not easy. It's not easy for, you know, it's not easy because people have different agendas and they have different personality structures. And people need, different people need different levels of guidance and different levels of support. Some people are more independent and they just want to go for it. And some people need the guidance. And I think that that commitment is something that can manifest itself in different ways. And it never stops. Let me give you an example from this day and age. Corona hits and, you know, we had to transition from the bars environment and the offline environment to the online environment. And, you know, as technical as it sounds, it was also a profound change. And one of the reasons it's such a profound change is not because well, it is because people consume content online in that in the bar, but it really impacted our volunteers. Because the DNA of our organization was the physical interaction with one another in bars. And it was for our volunteers and for our staff as much as it was for our audience. Now, it took us a while to understand how you know, how dramatic the change is and we are still undergoing a process. We are trying to redefine what it means to volunteer at Wize. Now, to be very honest, and I think it is you know, it is crucial to say that while we as the organization's leadership kind of had to step back and think about what we can do differently and how we can redefine the meaning of being a volunteer at Wize, it is, it was and it will be a team effort. And we need all of our volunteers and all of our staff to be committed to this. And if they're not committed, then maybe we're doing something wrong And just to finish the thought, you know, the key issue in all of this is that, you know, you make mistakes you test something in the field, you make more mistakes, you try to implement it, and you basically try to be honest and transparent enough about it in order to be successful, in order to transition well from one environment to another. 100%. The impact that Wize has had is phenomenal. But you've also taken part in quite a few other activities as a board member. Particularly, both of the Israel Internet Association, but even more exciting for me, the Alumni Association for 8200. So, talk to me about your activity there and what lessons have you brought from Wize to this association in your learnings? Well, so, I didn't start off as a board member. I started as a newsletter editor. And I, you know, I volunteered there and I spent a lot of time doing that about, I'd say two or three years. And I think for this, it was a very busy time for me personally with school and work and a few other commitments in Wize. And same thing, I just decided to go for it and see if it'll work. And I just really enjoyed the journey. And then at some point where I entered the board of directors, I'd say that I did bring a lot of the things I didn't do well at Wize. All the things that didn't really work well for me or didn't really work well in general and all of my missteps, I just tried to learn back from them. And the alumni association is a much different organization. And I love it dearly. I'm still very much involved and I keep on wanting to be more and more involved. I love the organization. I think it's a phenomenal platform for, to make an impact both on our members and our alumni, but also on the Israeli society. And I think that the one of the things that I kind of brought with me is trying to learn how to be a good board member, which is a very tricky thing to do. Because as a board member, often times you have a kind of like an internal struggle between being you know, you want to be there, you want to get things done, you want to be active, but you have to remember it's not your job. Your job is, as a board member, of course, is to weigh in, is to be strategic, to be thoughtful, to help, to offer help if you can, and also be a part of the conversation. I think, one of the things that, you know, one of the things that I carry on to this very day is that, and this is something that a friend told me, I think originally came from Stef Wertheimer but I don't know him personally. So, I can't attest. But a board member does three things. They appoint a CEO, they fire a CEO, and they ask, "How can I help?" And I think the problem starts when board members, in general not necessarily in any organization, but the problem is, is where board members act as executives. That's where usually where the problem starts. Now, we didn't have a CEO for a while, for several years, but now we do. We have for about the last year and a half. And I think that for me personally, it kind of was an opportunity to test my ability to be an effective board member and to be there for the CEO and to support and not to, you know, want to take charge. Which is never a good thing. Wow. That's fascinating. So, what were some of your responsibilities or what was your experience being a board member that if you're looking across the board, for these three organizations, what key insight do you have to potentially other board members that of how they can really be helpful and non-clashing? Because this is a topic that has come time and time again on this show of what it means to be a supportive and helpful board member versus one that may be clashing or disruptive to the process. So, I'd love to hear one or two key insights from your experience. That's an excellent question. There's a couple of things. One is, the role of the board in my mind, is to provide strategic, strategic guidance to the executives. It is, and I think that, you know a board can be too involved and it could also be too detached and both things aren't great. It really takes, it takes a very, very you know, it takes being very minded and very thoughtful in order to create the balance between being too involved and too detached. Right. I think that there's a conception, there's a and just I don't know, a thought there's a conception that a board needs to do their work full time. And maybe in a Fortune 500 company, they have to be, you know, doing their job like as full time gig, maybe. I don't know. I've never been in the Fortune 500 board. But I think that from my experience, the key issue is to work with your executives to strike the right balance. There's no one answer. It really depends on what your executives need. So, that's one feat. Striking the right balance between being too much involved and not being involved at all. The second thing is, as a board member, not necessarily as a board, but as a board member, and this is going to sound very cliche, but I still think it's incredibly important. It's crafting a good and helpful relationship with the CEO and with his leadership team. And the key to crafting a good relationship is to show that you're there, you're active, you're interested, you're willing to put in the time, but you're not there to step on their toes. At a certain time, you have to be able to take a step back and say, "I've said my piece. I'm not going to get too involved." And you know, I've done this. I was wrong about this many times. I have over kind of stepped my boundaries as a board member. I have been too involved and sometimes I've been too detached. And to be very honest, I'm still trying to figure out what's the correct word, sorry, what's the correct balance for each board that I'm in. And the last thing the last insight, if you want to call it, is different boards have different dynamics. And to be an effective board member, you have to be able to read those dynamics and take and kind of choose what role you want to play. Now, a good friend once told me that a person needs to know when they are in charge and when they are followers. In the way he said it was just typical to Israel, A person needs to know when he's a commander or a soldier. Yeah. And I think it's incredibly important. Especially for, it's actually easier for people who sit on several boards. But the idea is that, you know, different boards have different dynamics and they tend to have different levels of conversation. And I think that you want to decide how active and in what ways you can be and what is your role on that board. I'll give one example. In my role in the group dynamic in the Internet Association is profoundly different than what it is in the alumni association, in the sense that there are things, for example, in the organization's activities that I, I don't have a lot of input. For example, there's a lot of technical issues that have to do with, how do we make sure that the nation's servers are kept afloat. Honestly, nothing. I have nothing to say about this. That makes a lot of sense. And Arod, I really want to thank you for shining light for me and for everybody else that's listening about the responsibilities of a board member. And more importantly, the positive ways to make a positive impact on a board. And I think that it's I'm excited to take part in these activities myself one day. And then I'm definitely going to take a lot of these lessons to heart. So, thank you for being generous with your time and sharing that with me. And before we go Arod, I'd love to ask you the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. Wow. I'd say optimistic, conservative, and thoughtful. I love that. And I think that it's going by, by what we discussed today about your different responsibilities, that's exactly what you're exerting. So, thank you for the inspiration for that. And stay safe and stay healthy. And best of luck with all these amazing, amazing communities. Thank you for having me. And as everybody says, it's all about the people. So, thanks everybody. Thank you for having me. And thanks everybody for being a part of the ride.
