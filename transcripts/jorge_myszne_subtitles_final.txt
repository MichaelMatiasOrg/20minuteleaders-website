All right, Jorge Myszne, thank you so much for joining us on 20 Minute Leaders. Thank you. Thank you for having me. So great to have you. We know each other from the J-Ventures Fund. And I just love how I get to meet all these incredible people through this capitalistic Kibbutz. Jorge, you have a fascinating story which I can't wait to hear on this show about your journey from Uruguay to Israel to the US. The startup that you sold to Qualcomm. Your amazing work at Intel and on WiFi and things that I have no idea about. And finally about your new startup which, as you mentioned, you grinding on which I love. Jorge, who are you? Give me the rundown. Okay. So, originally I was born in Uruguay in South America. And then got married and moved to Israel when I was 26. And started to work at Intel, at the WiFi team at Intel. When I got there, we were kind of a small startup inside Intel. So, I think we were about 30 people. And then fast forward 2007 I left Intel to start my first startup and we were about 1500 I think at Intel at that time on the WiFi team. And after the Centrino and after the whole revolution of WiFi and went with other three partners and we started Wilocity, It was 60 gigahertz WiFi chipset company. And together with that company, in 2010, so I moved to the Bay Area to start the operations here in the Bay Area. And then 2014, Qualcomm acquired us. Moved to Qualcomm Wait wait wait. Jorge, the transition from Uruguay to Israel, not that common. Going straight into Intel, what was that about? So, you get married and you decide to just move your whole life to Israel. Yeah, actually. So, I started in Uruguay. I did my undergrad and second degree a master's degree there. And I always wanted to go to Israel and move to Israel. So, I had the opportunity when I was 18 to go because Uruguay's in the south. So, the scholar year is the opposite. Right. So, when I was about to start in Israel, so, I already did half a year in college in Uruguay. So you know it's just a bunch of excuses. Why not? But then I said, "Okay, well I already started, so let's make it here, etc." So, bottom line, I just finished there. And that was the next stage and the next phase when I could say, "Okay, that's the time." So, with my current wife, so, we said, "Okay, let's go." So, actually we got married and a month later we were in Israel sleeping on, eating on the floor. Wonderful. And you joined Intel, you joined the WiFi team during the WiFi revolution. What was that like working on technologies that really shape how we interface with the world today, especially my generation? Yeah, it was great. And I think it was a great journey. And coming from a big company and seeing how that evolved. It was great. So, it started with kind of one megabit per second and it was kind of a big revolution just to get one megabit per second. And then it becomes that great thing with all the operation at some point. I was in charge of one of the generations and we were manufacturing 50 million chipsets a year. And it was really great and especially when Intel decided to go all in with the Centrino and made the WiFi part of the branding of the Centrino and getting, at that time was McDonald's, getting hot spots in McDonald's because, of course, you need both sides. That was great. And just going everywhere and just the pride of going somewhere and say "Ah, that is the chip that I designed." That was pretty fun. Amazing. Amazing. Okay. And then from there, you go with a few partners and you move on to Wilocity. And there you developed technology that you actually sell to Qualcomm. Right? Yeah. So what was that like? Moving from a huge corporation like Intel and going to create a startup which is you said, 60 gigahertz? Yeah. So, the way WiFi works it's bands there are free, ISM bands. So, 2.4 and 5 gigahertz are bands that everybody can use. And at some point the FCCs of the world just took 60, a band around 60 gigahertz, and said, "Okay, this band is now ISM." And the reason for that is because of the size of the molecules of oxygen. So, there is more absorption than even in higher frequencies. So, basically, nobody wants to use it. It's not a good frequency to use because of there is a lot of loss. So, that's why they said, "Okay, you know what? Whoever wants to use it, can use it." And that's when we said, "Okay. We need to use it for indoor so not very long range." But because of the real estate that you have there, the bandwidth that you have there. So, you can go very, very, wide. That means very, very fast. So, our first product was 4.6 gigabits per second. Wow. And today, the ... goes all the way to 100 gigabits per second. Wireless. Incredible. And then what were you doing at Qualcomm? So, when we were acquired by Qualcomm, so basically, a couple of years earlier, Qualcomm acquired another company called Atheros. That was the big WiFi and became a big communications company, not just WiFi at some point. So, when they acquired Atheros, actually, they became kind of the communications group inside Qualcomm. So when we were acquired, we merged into the Atheros group and basically took over the products of Wilocity inside Qualcomm and just merging to the communications team and build the whole combo of WiFi and WiGig, that is the name of 60 gigahertz technology, etc. Wow. That's very very interesting. And now fast forward to today. You're acting both as an angel investor as part of J-Ventures, but you're also running your own company. I'd love to hear about this tension between these two things. So on one hand, we meet on a monthly basis, before physically now virtually, to look at different startups and different opportunities. Yet you yourself are acting the same role as the entrepreneurs we're evaluating. So, how does that play out? It's actually kind of funny because sometimes you are on one side of the table and others you are on the other side of the table. So you learn to, actually you learn a lot from being on both sides of the table. Of course. So you know as an entrepreneur, when you act as the VC. So, you understand what they are looking for. So, you know how to sell your pitch better on one side. On the flip side you understand also the guy that is coming and pitching to you probably for the first, usually at J-Ventures for the first time or the first initial phases, so you try to actually, you try to help them. So I find myself a lot of times just whether we decide to invest as a fund or myself personally, just helping them. And it happened in several cases. For example, one of the companies that we have that could have a relationship in South America. So, I connected them with some companies that I know and tried to get them going. Right. So, you appreciate much more both sides. Right. And well, you use the intel that you get on both sides when you are on the other side. 100%. I'm getting so much insight and inspiration myself coming in as a student and an engineer and I'm going to be an entrepreneur hopefully soon. And hopefully pitching to funds and angel groups like J-Ventures. And I think that just understanding the questions that are being asked. It's so phenomenal. And it's really humbling to see how many different things you can think of and what are the common pitfalls and how much you can learn from every single person, like I'm learning from you through J-Ventures. So it's really, really great. Kameleon, talk to me a little bit about that. Kameleon is the latest one. So after I took some time off - The latest adventure. Yeah. So, I took some time off After a long time that I was grinding. I took some time off. Spent some time with the family. We had a great road trip across the US from coast to coast. So, at some point I said, "Okay, now it's time to go back to the trenches." So actually I partnered with two other guys. One of them is also a guy that I worked with at Wilocity. And we started Kameleon We are trying to solve the cyber-security problem but from the foundation. So there is a lot of companies working on the cyberspace. But we see that basically at the end of the day, all the software runs on top of hardware. And that hardware was never designed for security. So it's a patch on top of a patch on top of a patch. And what we see is that unless you build a strong base, doesn't matter what you build on top, at the end of the day you can always come underneath. Right. So, this is what we are doing. And basically, Kamaleon is building what we call the SPU. It's a security processing unit that is a companion device to any system but in particular, right now, we are working on PCs and servers and protect the system from time zero. So, all the boot of the system and then during runtime, and isolates completely the attackers from the defenders and gives a very secure environment for the defenders where they can trust. And trust here is a big, big word. They can trust what they see. They cannot be fooled. And they get full visibility on the system, how it's working and what's going on. Is that why it's called Kameleon because it can change its color based on what you want it to, so that it blends with the environment? Yeah. So, one of the applications that we are also doing is what it's called Moving Target Defense. And basically, what you do is you change the memory map of the of the software that it's running in runtime. So, that's where the Kameleon is coming. We move things around so when attacker wants to attack the system, they don't know where, basically where the entrance is So, you are moving the windows and the doors all the time. Right. So, when they try to get into the house, they don't know where to enter from. Right. That makes a lot of sense. And I have to ask, going from corporate to startup to corporate to now investor, what are some things that you're bringing with you into this newest venture because you must be approaching this with a little bit more insight, if not a lot more insight than you had before. So what are some of the key things that you and your partner set out and you knew off the bat that perhaps Jorge of Wilocity in its early days didn't know? I think that working on both sides, on small companies and on big companies, you understand the motivations behind what people do. At the end of the day, you deal with people. You do business with people. Right. Doesn't matter if it's Intel, Qualcomm, Wilocity. Small, big, medium. It's all the same. At the end of the day, you need to try and understand what is driving that person. What is the level of risk that he's willing to take and why? So having worked in big companies, small companies, usually Americans, but doesn't necessarily need to be. You get to, at least, understand or recognize what are the things that drive people. What is the all the, especially in the corporate, so, the internal politics at the corporate. And who are the right people to talk to. What is that you need to offer. Find the person that can help you - You know I think it's so cool that you're dealing with the very low level of technology, very hard core technology, yet when I ask you about the things that you're taking with you from your previous experiences, you're not saying I'm taking more knowledge and more expertise in that domain. But you're saying I'm taking the understanding that at the end it's all about people and it's all about relationships, right? Yeah. And at the end of the day if you want, even though it's still silicon and semiconductor, I was doing communications. Now it's security. It's systems. So it's the expertise you know You can always find good people and build a good team, but at the end of the day, you need to know how to build the whole system, especially when you are trying to change some conventions, right. When I talk about cyber-security, nobody thinks about hardware. Everybody thinks about software, antivirus or whatever. Right. So, just shifting, making that part of the timeshift it's not trivial. And at the end of the day, you need to find the right people that are willing to take that leap of faith with you. And the risk, of course. Right, and say "Okay, we need to fix this from the foundation. We need to build the right foundation." And it's not another feature, and if it's white or black or whatever. Right. Are there more, I'm trying to think of things that I would wanna take for myself as I approach my own ventures later on and my own experiences in the tech industry. What are some of the earned secrets that you've accumulated over the years in terms of the products that you're building and communicating with customers and with different people? I think at the end of the day, you need to be very careful not to get in love with the technology, but have a technology that solves a real problem. Okay. The technology is the consequence and not the compass, right. So you need to be very, very careful. As a technical people we always fall in love with the technology. But at the end of the day when you go to a potential customer, you need to understand their pain and see how the technology solves their pain and not just, "Well, this is cool. This technology is really cool." So, I think that this is probably the main thing in terms of what you do with your things when and being upfront. I think it's the other one. As a startup, you are always with less resources than you want and you are always probably promising a little bit more than what you really have. And it's kind of a ... So while I think it's okay, I mean, everybody understands that. You need to be very, very upfront. You don't want to put your potential customers and your champions inside a company in a bad position. So you need to be very, very open and develop that relationship with them so they know what they have and they can help you manage that and navigate the company. They know that better than you. I love it. I love it. Jorge, we almost have to end, but I have to ask you my favorite question. Three words that you would use to describe yourself or that your co-founders from either startup would use to describe you as. Three words. Three words. Adventurous. Okay. I've been going up and down, right and left and things that I didn't know exactly how they will end. Grit. Okay. Sometimes, people always ask me why I left a big corporate with a big salary and go back to the trenches. But that's what I like. And the third one I think it's citizen of the world. Having lived in three countries now, at least 10 years on each, you get a little bit of each one with you. And you are always missing a little bit of each one. I love it. I love it. Wonderful. Jorge, thank you so much for the inspiration and for the time. I really appreciate it. And best of luck with Kameleon. Great. Happy to be here. Thank you. Toda raba. Bye Bye.
