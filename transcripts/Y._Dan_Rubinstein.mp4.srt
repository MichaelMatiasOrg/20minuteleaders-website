1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,519
So, at a certain level,

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,839
if you have this kind of CEO mentality

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,559
and I tell everyone I work with,

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,559
don't wait for,

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,500
you have license to lead.

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,079
Dan Rubinstein,

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,559
thank you for being on 20 Minute Leaders.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,960
How are you?

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,879
I'm doing great.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,759
Thank you for having me here.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,759
Of course, I have to say that

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,080
I love the brightness of your space.

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,080
It's very important for me

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,080
to also be in a bright space as I work.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,920
And it looks like you have a great setup.

16
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:50,359
And I have to, before we dive into

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,039
all the incredible

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,159
stuff that you've done,

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,160
whether it's running a company

20
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:56,279
that had over 120 patents,

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,920
or being an executive at various

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,520
of the most well-known companies,

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,600
you're a songwriter.

24
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,720
Tell me about that.

25
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,040
Yes.

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,200
It's something I fell into, actually.

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,960
When my son was five years old

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,560
he got interested

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,760
in taking violin lessons.

30
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,600
The reason he got interested

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,000
in violin lessons is actually also

32
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:19,719
a funny story.

33
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,279
We took him to a symphony concert

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,599
and he saw that violinist

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,159
was the one that was setting the

36
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,359
tuning for the entire orchestra.

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:29,719
Right.

38
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,800
The first violinist.

39
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,279
Right.

40
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,759
And so he said,

41
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,540
"Oh, I want to study the violin."

42
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,199
I love that. He wants to lead.

43
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,199
So, we signed him up for violin lessons.

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,080
And normally it was during the workday.

45
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,680
So, my wife would take him

46
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,360
in the afternoon.

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,160
And one day she couldn't make it.

48
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,560
She was also working at the time.

49
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,640
And so I said,

50
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,800
"Sure, I'd be happy to take him."

51
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,960
And I went there with him

52
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,600
and I was so excited

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,440
to do something like that with him.

54
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,560
I came home and I told my wife,

55
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,920
"I'm going to study violin

56
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,640
together with him."

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,320
She looks at me, she goes,

58
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,720
"You're crazy.

59
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,760
You play the guitar already.

60
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,320
Why don't you do more with guitar?"

61
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,360
And so, I ended up looking for

62
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,120
how can I expand my horizons with guitar.

63
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,320
I ended up studying jazz guitar.

64
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,240
And then, as I was learning

65
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,960
all these chords and melodies,

66
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,040
I started setting poetry to the music.

67
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,760
And over time I just started

68
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,760
writing more and more songs.

69
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,240
And it's been fun.

70
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,520
I've actually, I'm about to publish

71
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,240
an album in a few weeks.

72
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,920
My first album,

73
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,640
it's called, Stolen Moments.

74
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,120
Stolen Moments.

75
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,000
I have to say I'm surprised

76
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,960
that I'm not surprised.

77
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,000
It keeps amazing me

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,440
how the busiest people

79
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,320
that I get to interview

80
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,360
are the ones that are doing

81
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,840
the most amazing things

82
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,680
and the ones that are

83
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
following their passions.

84
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,040
And I just love it.

85
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,160
I have to say that I'm also drawing

86
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,200
a very big pile to my own father.

87
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,680
He's a fantastic mathematician.

88
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,800
He's also in the high tech industry

89
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,360
for a long time.

90
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,920
But he's a jazz musician.

91
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,600
And he plays

92
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,480
with his friends

93
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,080
all the time.

94
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,360
And you make time for your passions.

95
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,040
I just love it.

96
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,520
But Dan, you know,

97
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,920
Princeton Masters

98
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,720
and Masters at Stanford,

99
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,040
PhD in Statistics in Stanford.

100
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,480
You go on to be the president

101
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,520
and the CEO of Reflectivity.

102
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,240
Right?

103
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,720
It's sold to Texas Instruments

104
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,880
with over 120 patents.

105
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,480
And so, your whole journey,

106
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,280
then moving on to Google

107
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,160
and Facebook and Palantir,

108
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,360
talk to me a little bit about,

109
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,400
did you plan ahead to do so many

110
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,760
incredible things on your journey?

111
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:30,679
Was there any strategy

112
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,920
in planning this ahead?

113
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,159
You know, I'll tell you,

114
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,799
it's a funny story.

115
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,440
Because I don't think you can predict

116
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,320
10, 20, 30 years out.

117
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,200
Everyone thinks they know

118
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,440
what they're going to be doing,

119
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,399
but it's very hard to know

120
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,120
where the world is going to go.

121
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,880
So, when I was growing up,

122
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,840
both my parents were engineers.

123
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:54,760
And I got very interested in engineering.

124
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,120
And at the end of high school, I started

125
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,600
we had an apple to clone, but my dad had

126
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,600
built from a kit and sold it himself.

127
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,760
And I started getting interested

128
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,720
in programming it.

129
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,400
And one of the first programs,

130
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,520
serious programs that I built

131
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,240
was actually a program

132
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,120
to conjugate Hebrew verbs.

133
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,040
Wow.

134
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,200
So, yeah.

135
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:15,479
It was a very nice program.

136
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,640
I created shape tables

137
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,920
for all the Hebrew alphabet.

138
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,480
And you know, the Hebrew grammar

139
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,680
is very mathematical and orderly,

140
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,000
so you can actually create

141
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,040
a very clear algorithm

142
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,200
for how to conjugate different words

143
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,040
based on their letters.

144
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,800
And when I was applying to universities,

145
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,560
the guy who interviewed me for Princeton

146
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:39,559
was actually an engineer and a linguist,

147
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,919
and he got very interested

148
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,759
in what I was doing.

149
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,519
And he said,

150
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,919
"Look, if you get into Princeton,

151
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,200
send me a letter.

152
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,560
And if you know how to code,

153
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,840
I can hire you."

154
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,355
He was working

155
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:54,680
at Bell Northern Research in Montreal

156
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,840
doing speech recognition.

157
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,919
And so from there,

158
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,680
I got very interested in,

159
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,120
this is automated speech recognition.

160
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,760
Today, everyone takes it for granted

161
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,720
that you can pick up your phone

162
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,880
and talk to Siri.

163
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,400
But back then,

164
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,440
this was new groundbreaking stuff.

165
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:10,999
And I got very interested

166
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,359
and very passionate in

167
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,559
how do you train computers to recognize

168
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,759
human speech, human handwriting,

169
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,999
all these kinds of questions.

170
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,399
And that's what led me to go to Stanford

171
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,800
and get my PhD in that field.

172
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,559
Driven by curiosity.

173
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,760
That's what I'm hearing here.

174
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:30,319
Very, very cool.

175
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,119
Before you continue,

176
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,839
because it has to go

177
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,039
side by side with this,

178
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,720
this curiosity also leads you to then

179
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,680
create a company

180
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,840
that is steered by curiosity,

181
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,160
where you don't just stumble upon

182
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,240
creating a 120 patents

183
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,040
selling to Texas Instruments?

184
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,240
So, that's actually funny,

185
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,280
because when I was at Stanford

186
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,000
finishing my PhD in statistics,

187
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
the thing that I thought

188
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:55,639
I was going to do,

189
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,239
and this is back in 1998,

190
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,560
which is constantly the same time

191
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,880
that Google was getting started,

192
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,200
I thought I was going to go

193
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,080
and start a data mining company.

194
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,000
I was taking

195
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,680
entrepreneurship classes at Stanford,

196
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,440
learning,

197
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,640
including at the business school,

198
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,200
thinking about,

199
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:15,279
okay, I want to start a company.

200
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,360
I'm very interested in data.

201
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,800
Internet was I mean,

202
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,040
the websites were coming up

203
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,080
on the Internet.

204
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,160
So, this is all very new

205
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
and very exciting.

206
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,320
And so, that's where I was headed.

207
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:30,679
And then my roommate,

208
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,439
my grad school roommate,

209
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,279
came up with a way of

210
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,839
making a micromirror display.

211
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,839
So, this is a tiny display on a chip.

212
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,079
I actually have one here

213
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,839
on my desk to share with you.

214
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,064
I don't know if you can see it.

215
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:44,959
Yes.

216
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,679
That silver thing in the middle there

217
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,159
is actually a 1024 x 768

218
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,159
high resolution display.

219
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,040
So, on this little chip,

220
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,120
there is almost a million little mirrors

221
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,800
that move

222
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,760
their electrostatic they're actuated.

223
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,520
Each pixel corresponds

224
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,960
to one of these mirrors.

225
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,520
You apply a voltage and electrode

226
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,960
under the mirror and the mirrors is

227
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,000
electrostatic attracted and bends.

228
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,120
And so, you can control

229
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,840
where the light goes.

230
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,680
You shine a bright light on it,

231
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,640
if the mirror is flat

232
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,160
the light bounces from that pixel

233
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,520
and you don't see it.

234
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,440
And if you apply voltage,

235
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,320
the pixel bends

236
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,720
and the light reaches the projector

237
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,520
and then reduce it.

238
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,200
And you get color

239
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,760
by spinning red, green, blue light.

240
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,760
And so, we started a company

241
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,640
called, Reflectivity

242
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,080
to develop these micro displays

243
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,800
for business projectors

244
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,760
and large screen TVs.

245
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,360
The classic dorm story.

246
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,680
Yeah. If anyone knew

247
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,160
what they were doing,

248
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,320
they would never start this company

249
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:40,679
because it was the most difficult,

250
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,039
technically challenging thing.

251
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,680
So, the patents, it's not like

252
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,920
we had 120 patents

253
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:46,279
that we knew going into it that,

254
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,040
oh, we're going to invent

255
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,920
all this thing. No.

256
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,480
Dan, you needed so much new technology

257
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,080
to make it work.

258
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,320
Yeah. We had a 120 problems

259
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,520
that resulted in 120 patents.

260
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,440
So, we had so many innovative things

261
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:01,879
that we did there.

262
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,119
We built our own H-System.

263
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,399
We actually were talking to companies

264
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,359
like Applied Materials

265
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,599
to license our H-System.

266
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,919
So, building this chip required so much

267
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,160
surrounding technology that it just,

268
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,800
you know, necessity,

269
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,240
is the mother of invention.

270
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,840
If you have a problem

271
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,040
you have to invent a solution.

272
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,320
That's where it came from.

273
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,320
I'm already upset that we only have

274
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,560
20 minutes for this interview.

275
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,920
And that's why I have to move forward.

276
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,520
Because you go from there,

277
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:27,679
you sell to Texas Instruments,

278
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,879
you become a product management director

279
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,680
at Google then Facebook,

280
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,880
and then you find yourself

281
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,280
as an entrepreneur in residence

282
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,040
at Khosla Ventures, one of the most

283
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,640
well known venture capital firms

284
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
in Silicon Valley,

285
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,640
primarily focused on health care, right?

286
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,200
I believe that's Khoslas.

287
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,880
And he came to speak to one of my classes

288
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,040
and he was talking about

289
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,440
the future of technology

290
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,600
with health care,

291
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,520
and it was mind blowing.

292
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,000
What was that about?

293
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,119
Why become an entrepreneur in residence

294
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,520
after being an executive

295
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,960
in three companies?

296
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,040
So, what happened was

297
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,080
while I was at Facebook,

298
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,360
my dad started getting,

299
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,560
complaining of lower back pain

300
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,880
and we thought he had sciatica.

301
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,960
He thought he had sciatica.

302
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,760
And this went on for months.

303
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,480
And it turned out he actually had

304
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:20,839
stage 4 lung cancer

305
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,399
that had metastasized to his bones.

306
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,280
And it didn't get diagnosed

307
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,360
for a long time properly.

308
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,120
And by the way, this is a PSA,

309
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,520
if you have any relatives over 65

310
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,400
that don't have a reason

311
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,480
for their lower back pain,

312
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,160
they didn't have a chronic back pain

313
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,800
for many years,

314
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,920
so they didn't have an acute trigger,

315
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,600
one of the things you should go look for

316
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,680
is could it be cancer.

317
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,040
Anyway, he wasn't a smoker,

318
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,320
so there's no indication that he had,

319
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,200
and he had no symptoms

320
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,120
of lung cancer per se.

321
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,480
And this kind of set me an idea,

322
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,400
why is it,

323
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,560
and this is 2012,

324
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,840
why are we in 2012

325
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
and something so basic

326
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,640
doesn't get diagnosed in time.

327
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,080
Just the idea that companies like Amazon,

328
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:01,759
and Google and Facebook,

329
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,720
you know, you go to Amazon,

330
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,560
they know what you want to buy

331
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,040
before you do, right?

332
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,480
You go to Google, you type a few letters

333
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,720
and Google tells you the whole sentence

334
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,880
of what you're searching for.

335
00:10:09,881 --> 00:10:11,039
Why aren't they focusing

336
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,480
on also diagnosing cancer.

337
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:13,800
Yeah.

338
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,160
Or, why isn't health care

339
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,880
better use technology and data

340
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,400
the way these companies do.

341
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,640
And at least in the US,

342
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,080
there's several reasons for this.

343
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,480
I think the major one is that

344
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,360
we have this

345
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,680
approach to data privacy

346
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,720
that causes siloed data.

347
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,920
Right.

348
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,720
Companies like Amazon

349
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,920
and Google and Facebook,

350
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:36,519
they aggregate the data across all users

351
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,040
and builds very sophisticated

352
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,280
predictive models from that.

353
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,120
Health care, for the most part,

354
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,800
especially in the US,

355
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
doesn't work that way, right?

356
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,480
Data is protected. It's siloed.

357
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,400
And the efforts,

358
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,320
I don't think there's enough

359
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,720
being done to really leverage

360
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,760
the data and technology.

361
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,880
Right.

362
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,720
So, I got interested in health care

363
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,360
and seeing if we can bring this approach,

364
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,640
this philosophical approach

365
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,200
from the high tech world

366
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,080
to the health care world.

367
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,200
And I didn't know anything,

368
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,080
other than being a patient

369
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,000
from time to time, you know,

370
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I didn't really know much

371
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,440
about health care.

372
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,560
So, I thought I would spend

373
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:11,799
a couple of years just trying

374
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,680
to immerse myself,

375
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,080
see where I could learn,

376
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,040
where I could help.

377
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,320
And so, the first opportunity

378
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,880
actually was,

379
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,160
I had known Vinod for many years,

380
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,360
because when we were fundraising

381
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,000
for Reflectivity,

382
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,120
we actually pitched him.

383
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,360
Really?

384
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,520
I think he was still at Kleiner Perkins

385
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,440
at the time, if I'm not mistaken.

386
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,680
Again Dan, I'm sorry to interrupt,

387
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:35,559
but I have to just draw a parallel.

388
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,559
Because when I ask you,

389
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,680
we're in April of 2014,

390
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,800
after you've had such

391
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,440
a fantastic career already that

392
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,520
the vast majority of people in high tech

393
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,720
can only dream of, right?

394
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,760
Selling your own company

395
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,160
that is doing deep technology,

396
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,920
then being a product management director

397
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,720
of two of some of the most

398
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,320
well sought out companies.

399
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:57,119
And then you're saying

400
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,199
that you wanted to spend a few year

401
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,680
s to immerse yourself in new technologies

402
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,560
and feed that inner curiosity.

403
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:04,399
And that's I think

404
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,080
that's the most inspirational

405
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,640
that I'm gaining from this whole journey.

406
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,960
It's this driven by curiosity

407
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,360
to the Stanford PhD to solving a problem

408
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,440
that turns into 120 problems,

409
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,880
to then immersing yourself in health care

410
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,200
because of a personal story.

411
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,640
I'm sorry, I just had to

412
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,400
put that in there.

413
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,960
Please continue.

414
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,040
Yeah.

415
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,760
So, what I really liked about Vinod,

416
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,000
he has a very strong vision perspective

417
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,199
around how health care should be done.

418
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,239
And it aligned very much

419
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,560
with the way I was thinking, you know.

420
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,599
Essentially, how can we superpower

421
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,079
clinicians and doctors using technology

422
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,200
in new and innovative ways.

423
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,000
And so, I was lucky.

424
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,320
He was very kind.

425
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,720
And I was able to get a position

426
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,600
as an entrepreneur and residence there.

427
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,960
And it really allowed me

428
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,960
to see new companies, help out

429
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,640
in due diligence.

430
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,160
And I was planning to spend

431
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,760
quite a while there.

432
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,160
And while I was there,

433
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
Palantir reached out

434
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,480
and recruited me to come in

435
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,520
for a senior product role

436
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,240
at their company.

437
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,800
And they had a health care practice

438
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,760
as well, which was aligned

439
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,680
with what I was interested in.

440
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,920
So, I thought, sure, let's go do this.

441
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,840
And then ultimately, after about a year,

442
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,120
I kind of decided if I was going to do,

443
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
the kind of vision I had

444
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,560
for my health care startup

445
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,560
was not going to be easily done there.

446
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,000
So, I set out on my own,

447
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,720
and joined forces with my colleague

448
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,200
Cameron Marlow, who was the former

449
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,400
head of data science at Facebook.

450
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,320
And we started Physera together.

451
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,160
First of all, it's a fantastic colleague

452
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,600
to bring on board.

453
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,960
Physera, it's the company

454
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,080
that you're currently running.

455
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,880
Tell me a little bit about it.

456
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,320
And what I particularly like

457
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,280
to also hear from you is

458
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,160
what is it like being

459
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,000
a second time entrepreneur

460
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,840
with your own company

461
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,080
that you're founding?

462
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,520
How is the process different

463
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,280
from the get go,

464
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,520
not just in terms of the experience

465
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,560
and the knowledge that you already have,

466
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,920
but also in terms of the perception

467
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,120
and getting people to buy into

468
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,600
what you're doing, which is often

469
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,800
one of the most difficult things

470
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:12,680
for a first time entrepreneur?

471
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,199
Yeah.

472
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,840
Look, I think

473
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,759
obviously any time you do

474
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,479
something twice,

475
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,799
you get better at it the second time.

476
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,160
I think,

477
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
one of the mistakes

478
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:23,759
a lot of entrepreneurs make,

479
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,839
and I certainly made this myself

480
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,479
the first time around,

481
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,679
you waste a lot of time on things

482
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,119
that don't actually matter, right?

483
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,119
So, and what I'm going to say

484
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,119
is going to sound obvious.

485
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,959
But when you do a company,

486
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,919
there's going to probably

487
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,719
one, two or small number of things

488
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,760
that you need to do exceptionally well,

489
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,800
that are different, that are new,

490
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,160
that no one else is doing.

491
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,800
And that's where you should be.

492
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,840
95% of your time

493
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,640
should be focused on that.

494
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,240
And then there's all these other things

495
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,800
that you need to do, like

496
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,360
the corporation who gets what shares,

497
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,240
hiring employees, the accounting,

498
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,040
the lease, the real estate.

499
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,600
And an entrepreneur, unfortunately,

500
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,920
especially when you're starting out,

501
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,480
you don't have money,

502
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,320
so you can't hire all these people.

503
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,960
So, you end up doing

504
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,800
a lot of that yourself.

505
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,880
But the quicker

506
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:10,839
you can get out of that game, the faster.

507
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,239
Now, the good news is

508
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,600
if I just look at the changes

509
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,440
that happened in the world between,

510
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,920
when I started my first company in 1998

511
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,040
and the second company in 2015,

512
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,000
it's not that much time.

513
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,920
But the world has changed dramatically,

514
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,240
and all the things,

515
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,400
now, you have WeWork,

516
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
you don't need to go and figure out

517
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,160
long term office.

518
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,040
Just go and get a desk at WeWork

519
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,200
and you can get started right away.

520
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,920
There's software

521
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,960
to start up your own company.

522
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,160
You don't need to hire accountants.

523
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,920
There's all these things that you can do.

524
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,760
So, if anything,

525
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:44,239
I think starting a company these days

526
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,320
has become much, much easier.

527
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,040
And you get to leverage

528
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,160
from all these services

529
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,960
and cloud computing

530
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,400
that you didn't have before.

531
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,640
100%. 100%.

532
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,000
So, I have to ask, you know,

533
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,080
we just have a couple of minutes left.

534
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,040
Dan, you do so many things.

535
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,120
You had so many experiences.

536
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,520
What was the most fun you've had?

537
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,160
Like, what do you enjoy being the CEO,

538
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,120
do you enjoy being the PM,

539
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,840
the entrepreneur in residence?

540
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,800
Which part of the puzzle?

541
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,240
Look.

542
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,880
I think every job I've had,

543
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,760
I think there's been something

544
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,080
amazing and fun on it.

545
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,400
And in some ways

546
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,160
they're very similar,

547
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,200
in some ways they're different.

548
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,040
So, when I went from being a CEO

549
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,040
of my own company to going to Google,

550
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,640
one of the things I realized very quickly

551
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:28,639
is actually,

552
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,360
a certain level of obstruction.

553
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,920
It's all the same.

554
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,320
When you're a CEO of a company,

555
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,440
you have employees,

556
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,920
you have to convince your board,

557
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,240
you have competitors.

558
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,560
You go to a company like Google,

559
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,400
the entities, they have different labels

560
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,920
and different names, but it's actually,

561
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,320
the same kinds of things.

562
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,320
Instead of having to convince investors,

563
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,400
you have to convince management

564
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,120
to fund a certain project.

565
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,480
You want to get an engineer on your team,

566
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,840
it's just it's almost the same

567
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,720
as recruiting an engineer

568
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,480
to come join your company.

569
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,840
So, at a certain level,

570
00:16:56,841 --> 00:17:00,159
if you have this kind of CEO mentality,

571
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,879
and I tell everyone I work with,

572
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,879
don't wait for

573
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,840
you have license to lead.

574
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,039
License to lead. I like that.

575
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,719
Whatever you do in your company,

576
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,879
whether you're marketing or sales,

577
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,719
whatever function you have,

578
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,640
you have license to lead.

579
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,239
Bring the CEO mindset to your work.

580
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,640
So, you're not just doing a narrow thing.

581
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,120
Think about how it impacts

582
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,560
the broader problem.

583
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,200
And I think, you get

584
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,240
a lot of satisfaction

585
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,120
when you feel like I have ownership

586
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,440
of not just what I'm doing,

587
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,640
but everything.

588
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,800
It just becomes very satisfying.

589
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,640
So, when you ask me

590
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,400
what's been the most fun?

591
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,320
It's all been fun.

592
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,240
Because I bring the same mindset

593
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,560
to everything I do.

594
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,040
I love it.

595
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,600
I just love it.

596
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,320
Before we end this,

597
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,080
I have to thank you

598
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,440
for being a source of inspiration

599
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,600
for myself and many others

600
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,720
within J-Ventures,

601
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,600
the early stage fund

602
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,800
we're both involved with.

603
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,480
Whether it's the screening meetings

604
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,840
that I just love hearing

605
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,480
both you and [--]

606
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,160
and everybody else's,

607
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,040
but also in the monthly meetings.

608
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,960
Tell me a little bit about,

609
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,040
about your experience with J-Ventures

610
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,000
and investing in general,

611
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,400
because you're wearing both hats, right?

612
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,000
You're both taking three hats.

613
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Tech executive,

614
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,200
entrepreneur and investor.

615
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,040
Is it just a big mishmash?

616
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,640
Or are you really differentiating

617
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,240
into different buckets of your life?

618
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,160
Again, I think it's all aligned

619
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,280
in the same pursuit of trying to, I mean,

620
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,840
you know the concept of Tikkun Olam,

621
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,560
which to repair the world,

622
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,480
to make the world better.

623
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,920
So, in my personal life,

624
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,800
this is what I enjoy.

625
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,280
This is how I want to spend my time

626
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:34,159
making and finding problems

627
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,920
and improving things

628
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,880
and making things better.

629
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,840
Now, I can achieve that leverage

630
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
through other people as well.

631
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,280
If I invest in someone and help them

632
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,080
and mentor them, it's just a way of,

633
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,320
in a sense, cloning myself.

634
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,000
And so, I actually enjoy

635
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,120
helping the next generation

636
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,800
of entrepreneurs.

637
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,520
It's something that's very meaningful

638
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:54,720
for me.

639
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,800
I love it. I love it.

640
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,240
So, Dan,

641
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,480
I'm warning you that in a few months

642
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,040
when I go on my own path

643
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,240
as an entrepreneur,

644
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,880
I will reach out

645
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:05,799
and seek for some advice

646
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,560
and for your help,

647
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,000
because I just can only imagine

648
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,440
the amount of knowledge

649
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,520
and experience you've accumulated.

650
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,600
And I personally

651
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,160
on a very similar journey

652
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,200
with all of my friends

653
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:17,519
that we're thinking of starting

654
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,160
some things together.

655
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,080
We're pretty much we have one big rule,

656
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,920
which is we want to make

657
00:19:21,921 --> 00:19:23,399
a really big positive impact

658
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,560
and we want to feel satisfied

659
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,080
that we're doing something both

660
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
with the deep technology,

661
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,760
but at the same time really meaningful

662
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,200
to a big market such as health care,

663
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,920
and what you've done

664
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,640
both at Physera and with Khosla Ventures.

665
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,560
Before we leave,

666
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,440
thank you again for being on the show,

667
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,040
what are three words that you would use

668
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,800
to describe yourself?

669
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,240
So, I know you gave me a heads up,

670
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,200
Not enough of a heads up,

671
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,040
but I'm sorry for that.

672
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,720
So, it's ironic, but I wrote this down

673
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:53,599
at the beginning of the interview,

674
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,959
so I'm not making this up.

675
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,440
Wonderful.

676
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,079
I'll show you the notes.

677
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,399
It's like, it's curiosity.

678
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,839
You can see it.

679
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,039
Curious, helpful and efficient.

680
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,399
Curious, helpful, efficient.

681
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,559
Dan, toda raba.

682
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,759
Thank you very, very much.

683
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,720
And I'll see you at the next

684
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,480
J-Ventures meeting.

685
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,560
Looking forward to it.

686
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,320
Bye bye.
