1 Eli Barak, thank you so much for joining me. How are you? Good, how are you? I'm great. It's so fantastic to have you. We know each other for quite some time now, for quite a few years. All the way back from the robotics team when you so generously came and helped mentor our team, a relatively rookie team. And you've built some really incredible incredible projects and mentorship in Emek Hefer. and [--]. So, tell me a little bit about your journey. Where do you come from and how do you do that transition from an entrepreneur and investor to education and mentorship? Yeah, so first of all, thank you for having me. I think that probably the best definition is to say that I'm a serial entrepreneur, started in the software market in the Israeli army. Found myself focusing on software. My first startup I'd wanted, I did the first exit. I was in the CRM [--] markets. Moved to the states, lived in the US for five years with my family. Came back to Israel just before 9/11. And decided that I need to find something interesting to do once retired. Because the exit was good enough. And after 18 months of doing nothing and going to coffee shops, you need to figure out that you do want to do something. And I found myself by coincidence I must say, working with the high school kids. And robotics is an interesting platform, not necessarily because the kids will eventually focus on robotics in their adult life, but rather, because it's a combination of different disciplines including; mechanical engineering, software, system engineering, working in the team, understanding and handling priorities. So, modern robotics, in a way, it's a great platform if you want to work with kids and start some excitement in them to be part of the technology, a market or technology world. And this is basically what it is. It's a trigger. But Eli, before we get deeper into the robotics, I have to understand. Because most people who end up devoting over 100% time towards education and mentorship, they often come from those types of backgrounds that they've done that for quite some time. You're coming in as an entrepreneur, investor, serial entrepreneur, and you're saying all of a sudden devoting 100% of your time, or 150% of your time to help mentor kids. So, how does that work? First of all, 100% or 120% is a relative definition. If you want to have 26 hours a day and you find the time to do things that you like, I kept doing. And I'm still doing a lot of work with entrepreneurs, adult entrepreneurs. What you find out and what attracted me to work also with high school kids is that if you think about it, this is the next generation. You talk about the millennials now. Even if they are now 15, 16 years old, in 10 years they are the next generation entrepreneurs. So, even if you are focused on entrepreneurs and startups and you are looking for the next generation, you find yourself talking to kids. They are very intuitive, very innovative. So, I think that what you find out when you work with kids around those areas of innovation and out of the box thinking is that you can get great results when you have the mixed teams of adults and kids. And this is where I started with. I can say that to now about what, 20 years later, I came back to Israel 20 years ago, back from the states, 20 years later, and now I'm working with a lot of startups that are combining and we talk about it later, combining kids and adults. It's a great combination because you have great ideas coming from them. Yeah, they are less mature, of course, they don't have all the professional skills you are looking for. In the same time, they are very very innovative and are still capable of thinking out of the box. Something that we are losing as we are aging and getting a profession. Right. And this is very interesting for the ecosystem in Israel. And we find, I can point out now five companies in the hub that we are running in Emek Hefer, where we have kids, 11 and 12 graders that are part of those startups just because they met each other and are now involved. Right. 100% And I'd love to understand a little bit better about this community that you're building there. So, what you're doing with Emek Hefer is not what an ordinary robotics team does in Israel or all over the world. And it's gone beyond simply the six week first robotics competition, right? It's gone much beyond that. So, Eli, talk to me a little bit about what is the community within this education sphere like FIRST and what you're doing there. And then talk to me about what you're doing outside of just the FIRST program. Sure. So, again, it's not a secret that the traditional formal education system, the school system is not working or not working very good. Now, the covid-19 days make it even more difficult for that system. But kids are looking for something interesting to do. Everybody is bored. The typical answer you get from a typical high school kid that is coming back from school and, "How was your day?" And the answer is "boring" or "okay" is the best you can get. Like a very shallow okay. And the idea was to try to build some kind of an ecosystem that we, first of all, before everything else, will reignite if you want, people, and make them excited about their daily operations. So, the whole idea was to create some kind of an ecosystem, some kind of an environment where people could be excited about they are doing. Put aside their age, whether those are kids or adults. And since I'm involved for 30 something years in technology and in the startup ecosystem, we said and we meet together with another partner, his name is Liran. And we are partners here in Israel. Both of us are coming separately, but coming from the high tech sector. And the idea was to create some kind of a local, if you want, domestic ecosystem, that will be part of the community at large, if you want. So, it's not only your neighborhood, but it's the area around you. I would say 20, 30, 40, 50 thousand people in that area. Emek Hefer is an example. The Hefer Valley here in Israel. And try to bring content or create an enabling platform around entrepreneurship, innovation, out of the box thinking, not necessarily technology. But technology is a great start for many of those. Put everything in place, which means content, lectures, you name it, put it there, and allow them to consume if you want, the content in the place and everything you put in for them when they need it and develop themselves. So, we are mentoring and we provide the space if you want a hybrid solution. Because it's a combination of an open space, like we work together with an accelerator, and a venture fund, and we do all of those together. But not in a predefined program that says, "Well, welcome to our accelerator." "You have two years and have million dollar." At the end, you need to be able to fly or you crash. Sometimes it work, most of the times, it doesn't work. And the idea here was to try and create the platform. So, platform is a place to be. Offices, maker space, C and C, and you name it. Everything that you need to really make things and not only think about them. If you want it good, bring a lot of content from leading ideas and CEOs of companies that are coming and talking to the future entrepreneurs in different areas. Do mentoring. And really bring mentors that could take them forward and have a venture fund to do small early stage pre-seed, if you want, investments. All of that is aiming now not only adults, the usual entrepreneurs, but also kids. Right. Try to mix them. I don't know how you call it in the US, but in Israel, we have this spot that you do like a [--]. Yeah. So, I don't know what's the terminology, probably the same way. A melting pot, yeah. So, this is the best description of what we're trying to do. You put in a lot of good materials: good people, mentoring, location, you do it very slowly. You need to be, not to try to expedite things, you rather need to do it slowly and you start to see the community really building in front of you. And I can say that now, in Emek Hefer here, three years later, we have really a full place, we have a waiting list of 10, 15 people that are trying to join and we don't have any offices for them. We have more than a hundred kids, high school kids that are involved in any given time today. Yeah. More than a hundred. Probably next year, we are going to have more. Covid-19 created a situation that, as I said, school is boring. Schools are now cooperating with us and saying, "Well, maybe the informal education is not so bad and it's interesting." And they cooperate with us. I'm really curious about what do you see in that space? So, when you take high schoolers and I am a huge advocate of this myself, but you take high schoolers and you give them a different purpose that's intrinsic, informal education, that they actually get to build something and provide a product given executing on what they are learning, what do you see outside of the lab? Do they change at all? Are they more confident in different areas? So, great question. I would say that the main, think about it as a toolbox and you basically equip them with a new toolbox for life. I would say that 90% of the value that we provide to those high school kids is not technical at all. It has nothing to do with robotics or space or other areas that we are supporting. It's rather on the personal toolkit of how to be part of a team, how to integrate things [--] to what kind of integration, what we call systems engineering, processes, understanding of how do you really manage personal priorities. And one of the interesting feedbacks we are getting from kids and from the teachers in school is that once they finish the first year here in our program, they're coming back to school and everything in school is very very easy for them. Really. Yeah. They easily handle the timeline and they do the tests and usually the grades are going up. Although they spent about half of their time here. They are scheduled afternoons and nights and the weekend. And you need to really push them back out because if it's up to them, they spend every minute here. It's a community for them. So, all the friendships and everything. It's like youth movement, if you want, which, by the way, is something we are doing right now in Israel with the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Science, turning all that type of operation into a recognized youth movement. It's going to called Nesher, which in Hebrew stands for [--[, which is youth, something robotics. And the whole idea is to really recognize the fact that it is a youth movement with everything involved. So, personal skill sets, what they call the 21st century skill sets is the best value they are getting. Interesting to say that we see a lot of activities around us from different, the Ministry of Education, the IDF, the Israeli Army, are looking for those kids, not because they know how to do robotics but they are much more mature in how to work in a team. We do find a lot of situations where kids that were not the best ones in high school are finding things to really excel and do things here and be leaders in different areas. We work a lot with the girls and fighting very successfully the situation where girls are not getting into technology for different reasons. This is not an Israeli problem. It's a worldwide one. Very successfully working with girls, and really, if we mix groups working with different parts of the Israeli society, in Charedim that are not really into technology and we are doing very well with them as well. A truly free connections we have. So, the whole idea is using technology. We are doing it especially with two, if you want programs or titles, one of them you mentioned which is robotics in the FIRST organization; the other one is something that is developing all over the world now which is what is called the new space or commercial space applications that are starting to look at space, not only as an intelligence government type of area, but throughout the commercial or private sector that are looking into those areas. A lot of startups in Israel in this area, we are using it to attract kids to come to us. So, we have now a mouse, a simulator that we are building here, in Emek Hefer together with the kids that are going and that is going to have like an underground lava type of whatever, and you're going to have a mission to Mars in the control room. The whole idea is really trigger them, bring them in, once they are in, we get them. 100%. But Eli, I have to ask, so at the end of the day, you're running these programs, but how do you do this at scale? As an entrepreneur, as the entrepreneur or an investor, it's all about you create the value, you find the product market fit, you create an amazing experience, now how do you replicate this all over the world? Because I'm convinced. I went through some of these programs with you, with your mentorship, I know how incredible it is and all the tools that you gave me, but how do you get every kid in the world to have this experience? So, it's a great question. And it's a question that we started asking ourselves about three years ago when we started the first location here in Emek Hefer and we are six partners. All of us, by the way, are coming from the high tech sector. So, this is not real estate for us. The real estate part is just an enabling platform. And this was exactly the question that we're asking, "Is this operation is some kind of a one man or two men or five man operation and that's it?" "Or can you really replicate?" "Can you re-scale?" It took us two and a half years to really examine the model, refine it if you want. About a year ago we started to work on our second location up in Emek Israel, [--]. We are now working on it, building the new location over there that will be location number two. Hopefully we open around Pesach in the spring of 2021. Wow. We are already talking about the third location that is going to be somewhere around Rehovot, it's little bit south of Tel Aviv. The whole idea is to do it outside of the big cities. Do it in areas where people are looking, you have good community, high skills on one hand, but people that are bored or looking for interesting things to do. And you could provide, since you are out of the big city, real estate is cheaper so you could do things that you cannot do in Tel Aviv or in major locations. Like Emek Izrael now is going to be all around space, and we are building now a new planetarium over the really sophisticated, especially telescope that is a sun telescope. So, not only a regular one. A lot of development around this. In Emek Hefer we do a lot of robotics and agriculture, which is something we could do here because we have tons of areas around us. And [--] are the easiest thing to do. And yeah, I think that I would say, even on something which is important, you learn very early that if you want to have this smoothly working, it cannot be based on philanthropy. It must be a business model. Now, why is that? Why do you think that is? Because long term, it's very easy to get donations fund to build something. But it's basically impossible to keep getting those donations to operate it. Right. So, you must, in a way, come with a plan that will be not only sustainable, fund itself, but be profitable. Otherwise, you don't have the funds you need to really do the investments at the beginning. And this is exactly [--] it took us about two years to make sure that we understand how to make it profitable. Now, don't get me wrong, profitable while still understanding that there are impact aspects for your investment. Community is important, so it's not only maximizing the return of the investment in terms of funding and money, it's also in community value. That the model needs to be sustainable, it needs to be profitable, and once you do, you could do whatever you want. And very interesting to say another thing, the government, the different agencies, and I'm not blaming them, are never first adapters. They are not. They tend to join in later if you could prove that what you're doing is really working and sustainable and bringing value. Right. Once you do, they're eager to join because this is a success and they could adapt it. And I'm not cynical, but I want to say is that this is the way it works. Yeah. So, once you do it, I met yesterday the minister of science, Yizhar Shai, and he came to Emek Izrael to see what we are building over there. And now the Ministry of Science is supportive and we are getting money for different things we want to do. But this is only after we proved that we are able to bring money, do what we need or in the way we just find that you know what they say about banks, the bank wants to lend you money on when you don't need it. So, in a way similar here. You need to be on your own, be able to support your ideas and prove that it's working. Everybody else will join you later on, which is fine. Eli, this is an insightful and inspiring. I just love what you're doing there and I have no doubt that it will continue to scale. And I know the impact that you personally had on me and Emek Hefer, and the [--] I had on myself and my friends, and I'm watching everybody also in the united way. So, I pretty much recognized everybody from these amazing community. And it really is a youth movement just that it run technology less about camping. It's a different youth movement. Eli, before we go, I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. Yeah, this is always interesting to look back and think about it. I would say probably, I'm very focused in everything I do and people that are working with me know it, some kind of a combination, I usually say that I'm a tall person. I'm not very tall, not at all. But tall in the sense of your head need to be up in the sky, you need to be a visionary. You need to think about big things envision in long term, otherwise, you don't have really your direction and the big picture. In the same time, you need to be very connected to the ground. You're feet need to be well connected to the ground and need to be into the details. There is a phrase that somebody used that says: Think big and act small. I really believe in this. I think that we need to, and I'm trying to be a strategical, think strategy in everything I'm doing, which I think is a good combination to describe me. Some kind of emphasis on strategy together with very practical approach to life. And I believe that the combination is what makes it not only interesting, but I will allow myself to say successful. Eli, toda raba raba. This is wonderful and I can't wait to come visit the greater space. And it's just incredible the work that you're doing. So, thank you very very much. My pleasure. Thank you.
