1
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,880
Miri Polachek, thank you

2
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,040
for joining me on this show.

3
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,680
Glad to be here. Thanks for having me.

4
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,120
It's so so great to have you

5
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,760
Going to Boston University,

6
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,080
then to NYU Stern.

7
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,400
Moving on to all these great companies,

8
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,880
Teva, Pfizer, as financial analyst.

9
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,260
But then going on to Brain Technology,

10
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,600
and now finding yourself at Joy ventures.

11
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,040
And it must be the best name

12
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,440
that I can think of,

13
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,160
for any group or any organization.

14
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,640
I would love to be a part of a group

15
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,880
called the Joy Ventures one day.

16
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,080
So, you already have my resume on the way.

17
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,480
Awesome.

18
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,120
Miri, give me a little background

19
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,000
about what you're doing,

20
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,700
because it just sounds fascinating.

21
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,720
And take me through your journey

22
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,120
a little bit.

23
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,400
Sure. So, today what I'm doing

24
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,840
is running a really cool, as you said,

25
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,800
not only by name,

26
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,880
but really cool overall organization,

27
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,480
a very unique one, called Joy Ventures.

28
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,200
So, what we do, is we focus

29
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,760
on the wellness space.

30
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,840
Consumer products for well-being.

31
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,160
And we do so with a very unique model,

32
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,400
which is to build support

33
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,440
and fund companies.

34
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,240
So, we don't only invest

35
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,760
in existing startups, but we also work

36
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,120
with innovators and entrepreneurs

37
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,200
to actually build startups from scratch.

38
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,920
And we even go as deep as academia

39
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,840
to actually identify the promising

40
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,120
research and technology development.

41
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,480
To work with those folks as well to try

42
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,080
to turn those ideas and technologies

43
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,040
into products and companies.

44
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,960
Wait wait wait. Hold on.

45
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,640
I need you to walk me

46
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,820
through that process of,

47
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,440
because I get this idea of investing

48
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,720
in existing companies.

49
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,600
Young entrepreneurs come up to you

50
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,240
and they say,

51
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,200
"We have this great idea."

52
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
"We need some support

53
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,660
so that we can grow and scale

54
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,880
and validate our product."

55
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,520
But you're saying

56
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,520
you have a different model.

57
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,640
It rings a bell to some of what

58
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,920
my friends and teammates are doing.

59
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,920
Exactly. So, it's very similar.

60
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Yeah. So, there are some parallels

61
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,680
to teammate.

62
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,920
So basically, this is a model that

63
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,360
is actually becoming quite common

64
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,960
in terms of the startup building.

65
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,360
So, it has many names today in the market.

66
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,200
Startup studio, venture builder.

67
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,400
Yeah, those are probably

68
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,920
the most popular terms for what we do.

69
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,360
And basically, what it means is sometimes,

70
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,400
even if you don't even have an idea yet

71
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,320
or, you're really just excited

72
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,840
about the space,

73
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,480
perhaps you're an experienced entrepreneur

74
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,960
and you're looking

75
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,920
for your next challenge,

76
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,080
you can come to us,

77
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,480
or to this kind of organization.

78
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,640
Specifically, if you're interested

79
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,840
in our domain, you come to Joy, of course.

80
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,160
And actually, we've just launched

81
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,840
this week our new entrepreneur

82
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,160
in residence program.

83
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,400
EIRs are coming common in various VCs.

84
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,960
Here, what we're doing is basically,

85
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,480
working with a couple of EIRs

86
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,800
who just joined this week.

87
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,240
They're experienced founders.

88
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,140
They've had exits.

89
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,760
They've got the methodology down.

90
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,120
But now they're going to deep dive

91
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,200
into our space

92
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,600
and try to either work with our ideas

93
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,720
that we've actually, we've built this idea

94
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,600
back through various innovation programs

95
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,040
that we've run with our community.

96
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,920
So, they can either take some of the ideas

97
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,980
off of our shelves,

98
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,240
or, they can just deep dive

99
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,400
into market research.

100
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,960
Be inspired by their understanding

101
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,400
of the market needs,

102
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,080
and then come up with their own idea.

103
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,600
And then, actually spend

104
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,880
six to eight months developing that idea

105
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,760
into a mockup prototype.

106
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,080
Putting together a business plan,

107
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,800
all with our support as needed.

108
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,840
And then, come to us

109
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,280
at the end of their EIR program period.

110
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,800
And basically pitch their idea to us

111
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,740
so that hopefully,

112
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,640
by the end of that period,

113
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,760
we would be ready to invest

114
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,440
and start a company with them.

115
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,160
Wow. Okay. So, that sounds incredible.

116
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,960
So, it sounds like you're really tackling

117
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,800
the part of the validation of the product

118
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,960
and the validation of the market

119
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
through your experience.

120
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,280
And I mean, having people

121
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,240
that have gone through the journey

122
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,940
and have done this validation,

123
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,040
and this research, I think it's priceless.

124
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,720
But then, the real struggle

125
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,840
is then finding the people who are willing

126
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,360
to take on this incredible journey

127
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,000
for seven to nine years, right?

128
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,280
And marry and be passionate

129
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,900
about the product,

130
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,680
and marry the company.

131
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,640
So, do you find that

132
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,200
to be at a similar caliber

133
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,240
to the research?

134
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,280
How do you go about even evaluating people

135
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,820
who are coming in really fresh,

136
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,320
or you're looking to match people

137
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,120
to a certain idea from this idea being?

138
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,800
Yeah, it's definitely not easy.

139
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,200
It took us actually,

140
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,560
I think, close to six months

141
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,640
recruiting this first cohort of EIRs.

142
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,000
We are really looking

143
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,480
for a mix of the right experience,

144
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,820
obviously a cultural fit.

145
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,880
Because they're going to be

146
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,960
really part of the Joy team

147
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,160
for the next six to eight months.

148
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
So, we really wanted to make sure

149
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,200
that there was good chemistry.

150
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,480
And that we felt that there was also

151
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,480
some basic connection to our domain.

152
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,960
We want people to really be passionate

153
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,000
about consumer products,

154
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,120
to be passionate about

155
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,480
human centered design.

156
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,360
And ultimately, when we build companies,

157
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,080
or support companies,

158
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,120
we want to have actually

159
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,080
a really strong multidisciplinary team

160
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,840
that obviously has to have

161
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,120
a really strong entrepreneur

162
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,280
and founder at the helm.

163
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,480
But you also obviously want to have

164
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,560
strong tech and strong product.

165
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,320
Especially, since we're

166
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,720
in the consumer product space.

167
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,480
We really want people

168
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,760
to have a good understanding

169
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,280
of market consumer trends and so on.

170
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,000
So, one of the things

171
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,200
that you mentioned right before this,

172
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,280
was also this idea of wellness products

173
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,360
and products that ultimately

174
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,680
bring good to the world

175
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,680
and promote wellness, promote well-being.

176
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,580
What does that mean to you?

177
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,920
Give me some tangible examples.

178
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,560
What does that mean

179
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,240
thinking about products

180
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,640
that are for well-being or for good?

181
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,720
Yeah. So, it's funny.

182
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,040
And this is maybe, a good place

183
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,780
to talk about my journey.

184
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,120
Because, I was born in Israel.

185
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,880
I grew up in Boston.

186
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,600
My parents relocated to Boston for work.

187
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,680
My dad was in high tech.

188
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,080
My mom is a neuroscientist.

189
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,920
And actually, that's where my first,

190
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,320
my first exposure was, to the brain.

191
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,000
And it's a fascinating organ

192
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,920
that controls our lives.

193
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,840
And so, from a very young age,

194
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,640
this was part of the kitchen talk

195
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,880
and it was always very inspiring.

196
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,320
And I had a really great role models.

197
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,240
And even to this day,

198
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,400
when I'm almost 50 years old,

199
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,840
I still talk about

200
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,680
what great models my parents are

201
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,320
very often in my interviews.

202
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,560
And so, when I went on to study,

203
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,880
even though I didn't go into life sciences

204
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,760
or technology, in my education,

205
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,400
I chose economics and business.

206
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,320
What I found myself, though,

207
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,560
really connecting to

208
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,120
was the life science industry.

209
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,320
And so, very quickly, I found myself

210
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,600
going into the pharmaceutical industry.

211
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,440
And there, I was exposed to many of the

212
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,720
central nervous system illnesses.

213
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,240
Both Teva and Pfizer, are companies

214
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,160
that are very strong in neuroscience.

215
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,320
For developing products for things like

216
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,560
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, depression, etc.

217
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,320
And I think, Miri,

218
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,280
what you're saying here

219
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,920
is you went into these companies

220
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,360
as a financial analyst, right?

221
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,480
You took your economics degree

222
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,000
and you brought that into those companies.

223
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,120
Yet, what you're describing here,

224
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,920
you're not describing

225
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,640
your analytical work,

226
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,920
you're describing the passion

227
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,800
that you've accumulated over the years

228
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,400
for the life sciences.

229
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,920
What I found about myself very quickly

230
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,880
was that, there are two things

231
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,760
that really drive me to an organization,

232
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,480
into a position.

233
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
One, is the subject matter.

234
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,560
So, it doesn't matter

235
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,780
if I'm crunching numbers,

236
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,240
or if I'm doing any kind of marketing,

237
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,200
or management, or any kind of role.

238
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,400
I really need to connect

239
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,520
with the organization's mission.

240
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,600
And the second thing is, obviously,

241
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,720
the people, as you know, as cliches,

242
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
that is connecting with the people

243
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,960
that I'm going to be working with.

244
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,480
And what made me stay at any organization

245
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,320
for such a long time

246
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,160
was really just because

247
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,120
I've worked with really smart, inspiring

248
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,360
good people, high integrity people.

249
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,920
And so, what I found myself doing

250
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
was really working

251
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,080
in the pharmaceutical industry

252
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,880
learning about not only,

253
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,040
how to be a good financial manager,

254
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,800
but also about brain illness

255
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,560
and about how a drug

256
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,360
basically is developed and goes to market.

257
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,720
And how it's actually then

258
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,400
marketed and promoted

259
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,880
over the products' long lifecycle

260
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,440
in the case of innovative pharmaceuticals.

261
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,800
And I also experienced a short time

262
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,040
in the non-pharma health care industry.

263
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,080
I worked for a physician practice

264
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,000
management organization.

265
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,120
Also a very large publicly traded company,

266
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,600
a SVP finance.

267
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
But then, when we moved back to Israel

268
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,320
actually 10 years ago,

269
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,000
after living in New York for 12 years

270
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,560
with my husband,

271
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,240
three kids were born here,

272
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,400
I found that I really still

273
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,240
was very passionate

274
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,360
about the lifescience industry.

275
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,040
But that I wanted to really make a shift

276
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,040
from big corporate

277
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,760
to sensing the more early stage

278
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,640
startup nation environment.

279
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,520
Which is such a really amazing

280
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,240
and unique environment

281
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,000
here in Tel Aviv, here in Israel.

282
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,760
Very different from the positions

283
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,920
that you've held up until now.

284
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,120
Very very different.

285
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,240
Very very different.

286
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,080
Just a different company, Pfizer, Teva.

287
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,640
Yeah, extremely different.

288
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,400
And as a matter of fact,

289
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,720
when I first came back,

290
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,240
when I was networking

291
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,920
and no one knew me here really

292
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,000
because I hadn't grown up here.

293
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,080
I didn't go to the army here.

294
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,360
I didn't start my career here.

295
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,960
I spent 12 years in New York.

296
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,680
Even though I had

297
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,960
very admirable positions,

298
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,960
in Israel, obviously,

299
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,320
people want to see your back.

300
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,400
People want to know you.

301
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,840
And they want also to see

302
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,960
a relevant track record.

303
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,320
So, when I went started talking to VCs

304
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,040
in startups about joining, they said,

305
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,880
"Well, you've never done this before."

306
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,600
So, it doesn't matter that you have

307
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,400
15, 20 years experience.

308
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,560
You've never raised money.

309
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,200
You've never commercialized,

310
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,560
or brought a product to market.

311
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,640
So, that was rough.

312
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,260
But really, what happened,

313
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,800
and this is the word that I always use,

314
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,680
is serendipity.

315
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,960
It's one of my favorite words in English,

316
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,880
which I don't think we have in Hebrew.

317
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,240
It was just luck and timing.

318
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,020
And I had learned.

319
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,280
I just found out about,

320
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,880
I read in the media, actually,

321
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,040
about our former president, Shimon Peres,

322
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,560
announcing that he's going to launch

323
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,160
this initiative to drive

324
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,980
brain research and technology in Israel.

325
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,680
To turn Israel

326
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,640
into a leading technology hub.

327
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,240
And that vision really resonated with me.

328
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,320
Because obviously, neuroscience

329
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,760
was such a big passion

330
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,280
for me all those years.

331
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,880
As well as, the whole concept

332
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,360
and the whole vision was really about

333
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,800
innovation and about startups, and about

334
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,640
bringing the brain tech startup ecosystem

335
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,400
to the next level.

336
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,800
Or even creating an ecosystem

337
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,960
which really didn't exist.

338
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,600
I mean, the different parts

339
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,840
of the small Israeli community

340
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,320
of brain researchers, entrepreneurs,

341
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,440
clinicians, whether it's the neurologists,

342
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,880
psychiatrists, neurosurgeons,

343
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,240
no one was really talking to each other.

344
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,880
And there weren't really

345
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,920
investors in Israel looking at the space.

346
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,160
So, or at least, they were

347
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,840
only looking at it very initially.

348
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,240
And what IBT, Israel Brain Technologies,

349
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,600
which we ended up establishing

350
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,560
with Rafi Gidron, a very famous

351
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,880
serial entrepreneur in Israel,

352
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,000
and which I led for almost seven years.

353
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,320
What we ended up doing was actually

354
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,800
bringing that ecosystem together.

355
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,200
Breaking down all those silos

356
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,040
and creating programs for that community,

357
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,560
including a startup accelerator

358
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,780
for Brain Tech companies

359
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,160
and International Brain Tech Conference,

360
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,640
funding for brain researchers, etc,

361
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,880
to really push that sector forward

362
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,880
and really establish Israel as a strong

363
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,040
international brain technology hub.

364
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,560
And we really brought

365
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,760
lots of important stake,

366
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,400
global stakeholders to Israel

367
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,320
for that conversation.

368
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,080
And so, that was

369
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,480
a really amazing journey for me,

370
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,120
because it really, in a way,

371
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,320
it forced me to leave

372
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,640
the big corporate greenhouse.

373
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,240
It was an entrepreneurial venture,

374
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,760
even though it was a not for profit.

375
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,320
But it was really my first startup.

376
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,600
And it allowed me to keep my passion

377
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,760
in life science, in neuroscience,

378
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,400
in innovation.

379
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,840
But also, brought out in me

380
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,620
the more broader leadership which before,

381
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,680
was limited to my financial hat.

382
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,640
Now, I was able to really be

383
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,000
the evangelist for this organization.

384
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,200
To be the person

385
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,560
that brings people together.

386
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,920
And to really lead

387
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,400
all the strategic aspects

388
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,040
and put together this whole operation,

389
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,080
which I'm really proud of.

390
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,480
It's really, to this day,

391
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,520
I think it's one of the most

392
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,240
really special experiences that

393
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,920
I've had professionally in my career.

394
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,520
So, and that brings me at the end to Joy.

395
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,720
Wait, Miri, I have so many questions now.

396
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,220
I don't even know where to roll on.

397
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,000
We're going to have to have

398
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,270
an extra long episode this time.

399
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,580
I have to know,

400
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,520
so, first of all, brain technology.

401
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,840
It's a black box to so many people

402
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,260
like myself, that it feels like,

403
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,400
it's such a complicated field

404
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,440
that I have to go and study

405
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,920
biology and neuroscience,

406
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,440
and if I even want to begin

407
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,280
to understand what's happening.

408
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
So, dumbed down for me a little bit.

409
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,760
What can I be excited

410
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,160
about brain technology today?

411
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,960
And if we're extrapolating

412
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,100
a little bit further ahead,

413
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,520
five, 10 years in the future,

414
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,360
what are some of the most

415
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,120
exciting advances in your mind

416
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,300
as to brain technology?

417
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,560
And perhaps, how it literally

418
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,520
can shape our lives?

419
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,320
I'm constantly inspired by Nathan Intrator

420
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,760
from Tel Aviv University with Neurosteer.

421
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,680
That's about the scope of I know

422
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,120
and the work he does.

423
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,800
I think, it's a good place to start.

424
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,880
Still, I don't undertand anything

425
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,600
from what he does.

426
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,560
So, I need you to dumb it down for me.

427
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,440
Talk to me a little bit about it.

428
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,960
So, I think brain technology

429
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,160
can be defined and interpreted

430
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,960
in a variety of ways.

431
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,920
So, some people think of brain technology

432
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,240
as only the type of technology

433
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,160
that directly interacts with your brain.

434
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,440
Like brain computer interface.

435
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,600
Any type of technologies

436
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,480
that either measure your brain waves

437
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,520
or your brain activity in some way,

438
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,320
or actually influence your brain activity.

439
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:00,640
Right?

440
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,320
Like brain stimulation,

441
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,720
whether it's deep brain

442
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,840
invasive stimulation

443
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,640
or non-invasive brain stimulation.

444
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,880
So, that's just one piece.

445
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,680
But the way I like to think

446
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,580
of brain technology,

447
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,640
is really any kind of technology,

448
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,600
any kind of innovation

449
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,120
that can really measure

450
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,240
or affect our brain state,

451
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,720
or our brain health.

452
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,800
So, if you think technology more broadly,

453
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,520
I mean, in a way,

454
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,880
it can also be pharmaceuticals

455
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,840
that can treat brain illness.

456
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,280
But it can also be some kind of app,

457
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,140
that can somehow,

458
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,160
through the various sensors

459
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,840
that we have in our phones or wearables,

460
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,400
we can somehow monitor our stress level,

461
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,120
or, monitor our anxiety level,

462
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
our mood depression levels.

463
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,240
So, there are startups out there

464
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,320
that are now tracking

465
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,280
behavioral or mental wellbeing.

466
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,200
Companies that have raised

467
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,320
hundreds of millions of dollars

468
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,560
like Mindstrong and others

469
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,360
that are helping people

470
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,640
who are living with mental illness

471
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,040
better manage their illness.

472
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,800
Helping their caregivers and loved ones

473
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,080
be a part of that caregiving

474
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,200
and make sure that they get

475
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,480
just in time alerts,

476
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,960
if there is something wrong going on.

477
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,720
So, it doesn't always

478
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,460
necessarily have to be a cure.

479
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:27,880
Doesn't have to be

480
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,000
the ultimate solution for Parkinson's.

481
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,440
But if we're doing anything

482
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,440
to improve people's well-being or health,

483
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,400
and that kind of brings me

484
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,200
to the joy part of brain tech.

485
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,600
Which I mean, we don't only do

486
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,520
brain tech at Joy,

487
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,160
but we're looking at it.

488
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,880
Most of the years, I was involved

489
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,080
in companies or organizations

490
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,200
that were focused very much

491
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,600
on brain illness and trying to find ways

492
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,120
to help people who have various types

493
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,560
of brain disorders.

494
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,880
What we really focus on at Joy

495
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,160
is the other side, which is,

496
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,200
the majority of people around the world.

497
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,080
luckily, although these days during covid,

498
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,640
and I'll talk about that in a minute.

499
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,100
It's a different story, but maybe,

500
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,640
only one in four are suffering from,

501
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,800
it's still a huge number,

502
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,440
from mental illness.

503
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,560
And there are other statistics

504
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,400
related, obviously,

505
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,240
to neurodegenerative disorders.

506
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,600
But the majority of people

507
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,840
at any given moment

508
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,280
are just are generally healthy

509
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,640
from a brain perspective, let's say,

510
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,880
or from a well-being perspective.

511
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,320
They may have other issues.

512
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,920
We have a lot of big issues in the world

513
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,940
regarding chronic disease, and heart,

514
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,280
and obesity and so on.

515
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,200
But most people are just dealing

516
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,160
with modern life.

517
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,780
And that means stress.

518
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,380
And that means poor sleep.

519
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,400
And that means anxiety.

520
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,060
And sometimes, just feeling down.

521
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,560
And all those things are not,

522
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,120
they're not diagnosed conditions.

523
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,080
They're not described as some illness

524
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,640
that you necessarily

525
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,120
have to go to get a prescription for

526
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,840
to start some medical treatment.

527
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,640
But we're learning more and more

528
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,420
about ourselves.

529
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,560
That they really affect

530
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,080
our quality of life.

531
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,400
So, if it's for the last 20 years,

532
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,800
people have been really focused

533
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,840
on understanding that

534
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,160
they need to take care of their bodies

535
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,200
through nutrition and exercise,

536
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,560
people are becoming more aware

537
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,520
in recent years that,

538
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,800
Okay, I also have to take care

539
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,040
of this part of my body.

540
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,560
I need to make sure that I'm relaxed.

541
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,280
That I'm finding ways to reduce stress

542
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,520
and find ways

543
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,440
to just improve my daily life.

544
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,160
Because the stress isn't going anywhere.

545
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,240
In most cases, I mean,

546
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,000
some people have a choice,

547
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,240
but a lot of people are going to be

548
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,600
in high stress jobs.

549
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,080
They're going to have

550
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,680
not only stress at home, I mean at work,

551
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,520
they're going to have stress at home.

552
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,480
The young generation is balancing,

553
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,680
I mean, the highest level of stress today

554
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,320
is experienced by the young generations

555
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,520
who are balancing work and life.

556
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,040
And they're working very intensively.

557
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,240
But the good news is that young generation

558
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,000
is actually much more aware.

559
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,880
They are embracing technology.

560
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,280
They're already the ones

561
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,000
that are trying meditation and yoga

562
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,760
and all those things.

563
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,680
But they're trying to see

564
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,520
if they can find the solutions

565
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,640
through their phones,

566
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,360
or through any gadgets or devices.

567
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,940
Because they're very tech savvy

568
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,600
and digitally native.

569
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,800
Now that you mention this

570
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,420
and it's funny because I,

571
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,160
so, I do enjoy taking part

572
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,080
in a lot of projects

573
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,340
and various opportunities.

574
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,320
And oftentimes,

575
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,720
that goes instead of sleep.

576
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,480
And my girlfriend was very angry with me

577
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,680
because she's rightfully saying that,

578
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,160
sleep is one of the most important things.

579
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,880
And I'm not even aware

580
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,960
of how it's affecting my mind or my body.

581
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,280
So, I got this ring with inspiration.

582
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,440
Is that oura?

583
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,400
Yeah, it's an oura ring.

584
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,120
Yeah. Oura's awesome.

585
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,360
We love oura.

586
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,600
We love oura.

587
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,920
I've been wearing it for about two weeks.

588
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,200
We had one in the office,

589
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,320
but someone lost it.

590
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,240
So, now we have to order a new one.

591
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,400
We're fighting over it.

592
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,920
Everyone was using it. Yeah.

593
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,060
Amazing. But now, I have to,

594
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,000
every morning I wake up,

595
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,320
I look at my phone and I realize that,

596
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,560
okay, it's not that I got

597
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,360
six hours of sleep,

598
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,600
but it's how much quality sleep

599
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,240
that I get.

600
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,860
And I resonate so much

601
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,600
with the things that you're saying

602
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,800
about brain technology.

603
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,080
And I had an interesting episode

604
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,280
with a friend, Dan Seidir from Palo Alto,

605
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,960
and he has bipolar disorder.

606
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,040
He wrote extensively about it

607
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,780
in various tech magazines.

608
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,840
And he's working on a startup

609
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,400
where he's trying to help people

610
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,400
combat bipolar disorder

611
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,240
by using the webcam of the computer

612
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,880
to observe their facial expressions

613
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,660
when they're working, not on Zoom

614
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,120
when we're all smiling and happy,

615
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,320
but in the mundane day to day life

616
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,280
to give feedback.

617
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,880
And one thing that I've realized

618
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,600
over the past few months here

619
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,280
is that there's just not enough people

620
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,320
that are working on these things.

621
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,800
Not on the illness side of it,

622
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,000
and not in the wellness side of it.

623
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,640
Which is why I think,

624
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,520
what you're doing at Joy venture

625
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,360
is really really awesome.

626
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,480
I totally agree.

627
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,320
I'm glad you've realize that.

628
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,080
Because I think that there's such a huge

629
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,040
ocean of opportunity to innovate

630
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,080
both for people

631
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,080
who have more serious suffering.

632
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,680
I also have a brother

633
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,840
who suffers from mental illness.

634
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,960
And that's another reason why

635
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,240
it's also close to my heart.

636
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,800
And that field of mental illness

637
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,080
desperately needs innovation.

638
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,400
And I think,

639
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,000
all of the artificial intelligence,

640
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,840
and brain inspired computing,

641
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,200
and all these great talent also

642
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,960
that's out there.

643
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,480
Part of my mission has been,

644
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,400
in the last 10 years,

645
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,840
whether at Israel Brain Technologies

646
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,080
or at Joy, is to try to get people

647
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,880
who come out with these fabulous degrees

648
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,800
from very prestigious institutes

649
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,420
to actually explore this new space.

650
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,240
Yeah. So, I really would love

651
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,440
more and more people

652
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,760
to discover this world of brain health,

653
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,520
brain tech innovation.

654
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,680
What does it take for more entrepreneurs

655
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,600
to get excited about it?

656
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,240
Because I feel, and coming in now

657
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,400
from both 8200 and Stanford,

658
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,960
I'm getting a sense of understand

659
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,320
why it's difficult

660
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,360
for a lot of people to start.

661
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,680
And I think it stems from this perception

662
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,200
that while I may be excited

663
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,020
about engineering and data science,

664
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,560
going into the field of neuroscience,

665
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,400
I feel like I need to get a PhD in this

666
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,200
in order to just begin

667
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,180
to understand what's happening.

668
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,760
If so, that's not the case.

669
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,960
It's really not the case.

670
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,240
I think, first of all,

671
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,880
find a neuroscientist

672
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,200
and partner with them.

673
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,280
I mean, there are plenty

674
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,360
of neuroscientists out there

675
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,040
that would love to use

676
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,600
their knowledge and discoveries

677
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,600
in a way that can help people.

678
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,920
So, I think it's about,

679
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,800
and it doesn't only take place

680
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,480
in academia.

681
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,160
I mean, there's a lot of great things

682
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,960
that can happen.

683
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,440
But I mentioned all these examples

684
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,680
of ways that, ultimately,

685
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,320
it's understanding

686
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,400
what are the pains out there

687
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,800
that people have and just seeing

688
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,080
how you can even bring even just

689
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,520
off the shelf technology in a way.

690
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,160
The reason why we think

691
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,120
that it's such a great opportunity today,

692
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,480
is because, not only is science

693
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,600
come so far, but technology's come so far

694
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,960
that you can do so much today

695
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,360
with available technology.

696
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,480
Just finding a way to make it accessible

697
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,360
to people who need it.

698
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,560
And there's so many great things

699
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,840
that you can do today

700
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,280
to influence our state of mind,

701
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,880
whether it's mixed reality,

702
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,860
using VR, AR.

703
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,520
And EEG is just one part of measuring.

704
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
But here's so many ways

705
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,600
that you can influence.

706
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,240
There's so many ways

707
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,160
to stimulate our brain, right?

708
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,540
We can stimulate our cell,

709
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,860
any of the senses, all of our senses,

710
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,760
and affecting how we feel.

711
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,160
Right?

712
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,840
So, it's enough that for you

713
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,440
to do some vibration on my wrist

714
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,840
and you can help me calm down.

715
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,720
It doesn't have to be this deep tech

716
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,040
brain stimulation.

717
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,520
It can be just, hey,

718
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,040
it can even be just a game.

719
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,840
So, we look at companies now

720
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,880
that are doing really cool games

721
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,840
to help kids deal with their emotions,

722
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,960
train kids from a very young age

723
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,720
to be more empathetic.

724
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,280
Teach them empathy.

725
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,480
Teach them kindness.

726
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,920
So, it's about not only feeling good,

727
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,320
but it's also, making us better people.

728
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,160
And I think, as long as,

729
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,760
you're the kind of person

730
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,600
that wants to also do something good,

731
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
and you're really passionate

732
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,680
about technology,

733
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,720
there's no reason why you can't mix

734
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,640
both of those up.

735
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,440
And it doesn't mean that doing good

736
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,040
doesn't make money.

737
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,280
There's huge markets

738
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,880
for all of these types of applications.

739
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,020
And it's only growing.

740
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,080
If you take, maybe my last comment

741
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,680
will just be that these days

742
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,600
with the global pandemic,

743
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,200
it's just unbelievable

744
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,680
the impact that it's had

745
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,240
on people's emotional well-being,

746
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,320
and general well-being.

747
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,160
I mean, I think, there are a lot of people

748
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,880
that until now didn't realize,

749
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,880
or didn't say,

750
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,480
"Oh, yeah, I'm also stressed."

751
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,580
They always see people around them and,

752
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,600
"Oh, it's not my problem."

753
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,880
But now, there isn't, I think

754
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,000
one person on the planet

755
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,040
that hasn't experienced the stress

756
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,400
and anxiety and depression

757
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,560
associated with this whole uncertainty

758
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,200
around the pandemic.

759
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,080
Whether it's financially driven

760
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,400
because someone is no longer working,

761
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,200
or just not knowing

762
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,080
what's going to happen tomorrow.

763
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,600
The social isolation

764
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,640
and all the loneliness

765
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,120
that it's causing people,

766
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,760
all of those things.

767
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,360
I mean, they're manifesting themselves

768
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,600
and just accelerating the awareness

769
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,000
and the need for solutions

770
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,560
to help people cope

771
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,960
with very high levels of stress,

772
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,920
lack of sleep, etc.

773
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,680
So, anything we can innovate

774
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,000
to bring people together

775
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,960
through the screens

776
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,520
to help people feel better,

777
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,800
to reduce their stress.

778
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,120
And it's not just meditation.

779
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,360
Meditation isn't for everyone.

780
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,360
There's a lot of noise around meditation,

781
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,480
through headspace and calm,

782
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,600
and it's great.

783
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,800
But not everybody likes it.

784
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,600
And it's not the only way

785
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,400
to help people feel good.

786
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,880
So, we're really putting

787
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,800
the call out there

788
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,920
for really smart, passionate

789
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,660
techs and entrepreneurs,

790
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,320
to think about how can technology

791
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,160
serve humanity's quest for well-being.

792
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,080
What kind of products

793
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,520
can we develop for consumers.

794
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,480
Of course, it's important to treat people

795
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,180
with brain illness, and,

796
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,120
but at the same time,

797
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,360
there's so much opportunity

798
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,660
to look at consumers.

799
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,560
The day to day,

800
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,880
if it's our grandmothers,

801
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,560
if it's our children,

802
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,200
if it's our brothers and sisters,

803
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,320
just help them find ways to feel good,

804
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,640
to connect with each other

805
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,040
and to create healthy habits.

806
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,360
Miri, before we leave, two notes.

807
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,240
One, if people have this passion

808
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,540
for wellness and for,

809
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,840
I love what you said,

810
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,880
going about solving the human quest

811
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,240
for wellness and wellbeing,

812
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,600
and not just about illnesses.

813
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,480
But I'm looking at my own grandparents

814
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,200
and how there is so little solutions

815
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,720
that connect the younger generation

816
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,280
to the older generation.

817
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,000
It's unbelievable that I'm watching,

818
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,480
as a part of J-Ventures, I get to watch

819
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,120
hundreds of different startups

820
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,080
come in yearly.

821
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,400
So few of them are dealing

822
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,080
with these issues that are so prevalent

823
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,280
and they were just growing.

824
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,120
I mean, the gap is just increasing

825
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,320
every day that goes by.

826
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,600
So, definitely, they should reach out

827
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,720
to Joy Ventures, I guess.

828
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,120
And I think that your're a perfect address

829
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,320
to give them advice,

830
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,400
and to talk them through their ideas

831
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,440
and where we're headed.

832
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,020
And the second thing,

833
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,600
the last thing that I always love to do

834
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,080
is I'm going to put you on the spot

835
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,600
one time during this interview.

836
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,160
And I need three words

837
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,720
that you would use to describe yourself,

838
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,680
or that anybody on your team would use

839
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,740
to describe yourself, or Rafi,

840
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,920
or any of the entrepreneurs

841
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,760
that you're helping.

842
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,200
So, if it's describing me,

843
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,520
I think "optimism"

844
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,760
is a really big part of who I am.

845
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,200
I really believe in the ability to,

846
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,125
I really see things

847
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:06,560
with the half full cup.

848
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,400
I think that your work at Joy Ventures,

849
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,760
you bring optimism to the table already,

850
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,480
just with a name.

851
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,160
Yeah. Yeah. But it really is who I am.

852
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,520
It's not just on paper.

853
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,800
And for me, also another big piece,

854
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,840
is "connecting".

855
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,360
So, I really love

856
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,360
bringing people together.

857
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,000
And I think that

858
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,920
with innovation and startups,

859
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,080
that's also really super important.

860
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,600
I think when we deal with innovation,

861
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,160
it's not just about one person.

862
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,600
It's really about,

863
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,940
not only going out and talking to people

864
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,840
and understanding

865
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,920
what are people's pains,

866
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,480
but also forming teams

867
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,160
and working together.

868
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,480
And that's a big passion of mine.

869
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,800
It's like enabling innovation

870
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,160
through connecting people

871
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,840
and connecting organizations and people

872
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,280
with different areas of expertise.

873
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,040
And I guess,

874
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,040
because of this conversation we've had,

875
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,880
I think we're going to need

876
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,800
to put the word "brain" as the third one.

877
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,560
Because brain or brain tech, I think,

878
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,000
is going to be another good key word.

879
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,120
So, yeah, let's go for those.

880
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,720
So, optimist, unity and brain. I love it.

881
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,440
I think it's a wonderful combination.

882
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,120
Miri, I can't wait to learn more

883
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,160
about what you guys do at Joy Ventures.

884
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,640
And it resonates so much

885
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,840
because the reason

886
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,280
I came here to Palo Alto after the union

887
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,920
was to understand

888
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,160
what are some of the biggest challenges

889
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,040
that technology can help solve.

890
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,840
And the more I'm exposed to these ideas,

891
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,160
the more passionate I get at them.

892
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,760
And definitely I can see myself

893
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,320
taking part in this world

894
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,360
that you're surrounded in.

895
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,360
And it just sounds fantastic.

896
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,720
Miri, thank you

897
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,280
for being so generous with your time.

898
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,120
Thank you for allowing me to run over

899
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,040
because I enjoyed this interview so much.

900
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,280
This is definitely longer than usual.

901
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,200
But I just loved every minute of it.

902
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:52,680
So thank you very much.

903
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,100
I enjoyed it too, Michael.

904
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,000
Thank you so much for inviting me.

905
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,880
It's been a real joy.

906
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,800
And good luck with this program.

907
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,560
It's a really wonderful initiative.

908
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,280
I hope you enjoy it to.

909
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,760
Thank you. Thank you very very much.

910
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,880
Take care.

911
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,160
All the best. Good health.

912
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:24,560
