1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,645
We've seen some companies

2
00:00:01,845 --> 00:00:03,211
that created  a lot of value

3
00:00:03,411 --> 00:00:04,480
with non-paying customers

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,640
got acquired for very

5
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,120
large sums of money.

6
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,160
But ultimately to me,

7
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,120
if customers are paying,

8
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,080
it means they really value

9
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,280
what it is you're delivering.

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,520
Lilia Shirman,

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,640
thank you so much for joining me.

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,360
How are you today?

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,400
Great, Michael.

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,720
Thanks for having me.

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,280
Of course.

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,080
Where are you calling from?

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,120
I am right in the middle

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,480
of Silicon Valley, actually,

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,000
in Redwood City, California.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,080
In the middle of Silicon Valley,

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,040
Redwood City, California.

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,560
So, today, you are the CEO

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,920
of the Shirman Group,

24
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,520
an expert in Go-to-Market,

25
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,840
and we'll talk all about that.

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,800
We'll talk about the difference

27
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,880
between Go-to-Market and marketing.

28
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,920
And we have quite a long journey

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,640
to get through today.

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,920
But we have to start all the way back

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,220
to your first job,

32
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,880
in college, I believe,

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,680
when you were wearing a bunny suit.

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,160
So, it's quite a long journey

35
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,960
from wearing a bunny suit to the job

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,640
to being the CEO

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,360
of a consultancy group in Silicon Valley.

38
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,280
But take me all the way back there

39
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,480
and paint me the picture.

40
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,760
Sure.

41
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,000
So, the summer

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,560
after my junior year in college,

43
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,480
I got a job at Applied Materials,

44
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,640
which is a semiconductor

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,320
equipment company.

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,200
And part of the company I worked with

47
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,800
was the, what was called final test.

48
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,200
So, it was where these very large

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,720
multimillion dollar machines,

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,320
imagine a minivan sized

51
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
piece of equipment

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,720
with robotics and gas lines

53
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,760
and vacuum chambers

54
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,600
and all kinds of things,

55
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,160
going through final tests

56
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,000
before they go out

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,720
to a semiconductor fab.

58
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,920
And they had to be in a clean room.

59
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,720
So, to get in there,

60
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,480
you have to wear

61
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,120
what's called a bunny suit,

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,520
which is this white coverall

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,480
because you don't want any

64
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,920
extra particles.

65
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,840
And it becomes,

66
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
you don't think about the jargon

67
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,600
you use in your job.

68
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,800
And so, once in a while, I would say,

69
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,600
yeah, I spent all day in a bunny suit.

70
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,040
And people would kind of look at me like,

71
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,360
"What's your job exactly?"

72
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,080
Right.

73
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,560
And I actually ended up staying

74
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,520
in Applied Materials

75
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,920
for about another four years

76
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,160
after graduation.

77
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,880
They kept me

78
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,800
all through senior year and beyond.

79
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
So, yeah, that was,

80
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,280
that's my bunny suit story.

81
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,840
And it's not nearly as exciting,

82
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,120
I'm sorry, as one might think.

83
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,920
Well, it's still a great story.

84
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,200
So then, what happened?

85
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,560
So, you're starting out

86
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,640
in Applied Materials,

87
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,960
you spend quite a few years there,

88
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,320
mainly wearing a bunny suit,

89
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,080
and how do you end up

90
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,360
becoming an expert

91
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,440
in Go-to-Market strategy?

92
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,560
Yeah.

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,840
So, even then,

94
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,600
because I was in this

95
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,240
the culmination of all the things

96
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,080
that the company did,

97
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,680
my job was

98
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,760
started out being about quality.

99
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,440
So, all the problems you would find

100
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,160
before we were sending the machines out

101
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,800
to the customer

102
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,840
came from all kinds of different places,

103
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,280
whether it was suppliers or assembly,

104
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,360
or a faulty part,

105
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,600
or whatever it may be.

106
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,960
And so, I got a view really early on

107
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,640
into the interconnectedness

108
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,320
of all things,

109
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,920
into how all of the different things

110
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,600
that happened along the supply chain

111
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,200
contribute to the final product.

112
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,960
And so, while still at Applied Materials,

113
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,080
I applied to Stanford graduate school,

114
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,520
I got in.

115
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,880
Applied was kind enough

116
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,840
to give me a fellowship to do that.

117
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,800
So, that was the first step

118
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,400
in what I called

119
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,920
the journey to the dark side.

120
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,000
I did a really cool program

121
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,600
that was in the engineering school,

122
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,494
but had a lot of business school

123
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:12,760
pieces to it.

124
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,560
And a funny side story about that,

125
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,000
my master's project,

126
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,360
the class produced

127
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,960
what is the gorilla pod,

128
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,920
which is that little stand for cameras

129
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,080
made out of little balls.

130
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,760
Okay.

131
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,440
So, that was the winning team

132
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,720
and we were the runners up.

133
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,360
Wow.

134
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,640
And so, coming out of Stanford,

135
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,800
I got recruited by Accenture,

136
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,600
which is one of the big consulting firms,

137
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,000
their strategy practice.

138
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,200
Right.

139
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,080
And did supply chain strategy

140
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,000
for several years.

141
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,160
So, what does that mean

142
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,560
supply chain strategy?

143
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,720
Like I'm imagining in the day to day,

144
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,960
you have to talk to,

145
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,920
you have to really like,

146
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,360
sit in front of a huge map

147
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,920
and think about

148
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,280
what are the different opportunities

149
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,320
to go to get the products across.

150
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
How does that actually look like?

151
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,720
So, some of it is optimization.

152
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,440
How many warehouses where,

153
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,560
how many factories,

154
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,320
the distribution network.

155
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,520
Some of it is more broad.

156
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,200
We did quite a bit of acquisition work.

157
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:21,320
The Compaq-DEC acquisition,

158
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,520
Ascend and Cascade merged,

159
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,640
which I always thought was funny

160
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,440
because the two names

161
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,480
were exactly opposites.

162
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,360
So, it was bringing together

163
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,080
operations of different companies.

164
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,520
I think a better really descriptor

165
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,320
for what we were doing

166
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,000
was operational strategy.

167
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It wasn't just really

168
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,080
supply chain and logistics.

169
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,200
Although some clients

170
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,840
had Accenture doing that as well.

171
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,240
So, it was sort of a nice segue

172
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,560
between my very geeky

173
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,840
engineering background,

174
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,800
and sort of looking at it

175
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,600
from a business perspective.

176
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,520
And so, I kind of call

177
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,920
my time at Accenture my,

178
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,960
if the MBA wasn't the title

179
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,800
of my master's,

180
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,920
and that those three years

181
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,840
definitely were.

182
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,560
And I ended up doing,

183
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,280
something I knew

184
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,480
absolutely nothing about,

185
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,680
and I joked that that's I like to

186
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,120
every five or six years,

187
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,520
go and start something new

188
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,200
that I know nothing about and learn it

189
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,520
and then go do something else.

190
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,520
So, after Accenture,

191
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,720
I went to BEA Systems,

192
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,600
which is a software company.

193
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
And I had no idea

194
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,480
about anything to do with software.

195
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,600
I went into a product marketing role.

196
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,440
I had no idea about marketing.

197
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,640
The reason I ended up there is because

198
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,560
they were diversifying away

199
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,760
from their core technology

200
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,280
into areas that required an understanding

201
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,440
of why integrating data and systems

202
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,400
and so on would matter to our customer.

203
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,360
And that I understood.

204
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,400
So, yeah.

205
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,600
So, they took a chance and they hired

206
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,840
what I thought was the kind of

207
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,120
unqualified person and it was a blast.

208
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,920
It was a blast

209
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,160
to do something really new.

210
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,800
It sounds really fascinating.

211
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,000
And I'd love to transition

212
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,920
and then discuss a little bit about

213
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,640
the idea behind Go-to-Market strategies.

214
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,480
100%, we're seeing

215
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,280
so many different emerging markets today,

216
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,200
so many emerging technologies,

217
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
that I get to observe both

218
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,360
as a student at Stanford

219
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,440
from the engineering side,

220
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,000
but also as a member of J-Ventures

221
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,480
from the investment side.

222
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,960
And one of the key questions is always,

223
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,840
how do you bring the products out

224
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,600
to the audience

225
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,160
and not in terms of marketing,

226
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,720
but how do you actually,

227
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,240
what is the chain like to get there?

228
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,520
And it's obviously,

229
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,880
it's a common question

230
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,640
for a small startup

231
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,960
and for a big enterprise.

232
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,880
Can you start Lilia, by explaining to me

233
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,480
what is Go-to-Market fundamentally,

234
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,400
and why is it such a crucial aspect?

235
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,640
And then allude to how your firm

236
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,680
helps companies optimize that.

237
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:02,640
Yeah.

238
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,600
So, I define go to market very broadly.

239
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,720
To me, it's pretty much everything

240
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,680
a company does

241
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,600
to get its product out

242
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,080
in front of paying customers, right?

243
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,680
Why paying?

244
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,200
Why is that an important piece of it?

245
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,720
Because

246
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,280
if you don't have paying customers,

247
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,920
eventually you run out of cash

248
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,280
and can't do whatever magic

249
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,840
it is you want to do, fundamentally.

250
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:32,200
And yes, we've seen some companies

251
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,040
that created a lot of value

252
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,240
with non-paying customers,

253
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,400
got acquired for very

254
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,920
large sums of money.

255
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,920
But ultimately, to me,

256
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
if customers are paying,

257
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,840
it means they really value

258
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,040
what it is you're delivering.

259
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,640
Right?

260
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,240
And I'm also assuming that

261
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,640
the reason that word is in there

262
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
is because the strategy

263
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,400
is inherently different.

264
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,840
A way to acquire a free customer

265
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,480
is very different

266
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
than acquiring a paying customer.

267
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,920
It's maybe a different demographic,

268
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,680
different strategy,

269
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,560
different friction to get there.

270
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,160
Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely.

271
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,200
And of course, it's different

272
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,600
between business customers

273
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
and consumers as well.

274
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,360
Right, right.

275
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,640
Yeah.

276
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,520
And my focus has definitely been

277
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,800
on the business side.

278
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,840
But I think a lot of the,

279
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,360
the ways that

280
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,480
we think about delivering value

281
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,280
and unifying everything you do

282
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,520
that's customer facing

283
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,680
is very relevant

284
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,280
to both consumers and businesses.

285
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,160
Right.

286
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,680
And so, when I think about

287
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,400
Go-to-Market for younger companies,

288
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,800
there's always when you're pitching

289
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,600
to investors, there's always the slide.

290
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,520
You're told you have to have

291
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,280
a Go-to-Market slide.

292
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,040
And a lot of founders

293
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,520
really struggle with that

294
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,480
because they're thinking,

295
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,680
we don't know yet,

296
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,360
we're early,

297
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,760
or they don't have that expertise

298
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,720
on the team.

299
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,600
And so, that slide is probably

300
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,880
has the largest variation I've seen

301
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,480
in terms of something that makes sense

302
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,960
and something that's just clearly

303
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,760
pulled out of the air

304
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,200
in the last, as an afterthought

305
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,600
to the rest of the presentation.

306
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,840
There are three parts

307
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,120
when I think about Go-to-Market.

308
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,320
There's sort of the strategy,

309
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,920
and the fundamental thing,

310
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
the fundamental decision is

311
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,120
who are we serving

312
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,280
and what problem are we solving.

313
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,160
That's really, really simple, right?

314
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,040
And that's something

315
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,000
that you should at least have a,

316
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,040
a good idea or a good thesis about

317
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,520
when you start out, right?

318
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,840
And then the questions to follow

319
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,360
are things like,

320
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,760
by what means

321
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,240
are we solving that problem;

322
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,000
and what mode

323
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,600
are we going to build around it

324
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,480
that's defensible long term.

325
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,520
Those four questions at a startup level

326
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,400
is what you need to answer.

327
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
As you grow,

328
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,600
then you get into planning and content

329
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,960
and value propositions

330
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,040
and marketing strategy

331
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,280
and alliances and all the other things

332
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,280
that make up Go-to-Market.

333
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,560
But at the beginning,

334
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,440
those four questions

335
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,560
who, what are we doing for them;

336
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,800
how are we doing it;

337
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,640
and how are we going to keep this

338
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,400
wow and unique,

339
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
are the four things

340
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,200
you really need to think about.

341
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,800
Right.

342
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,440
So, it makes perfect sense

343
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,200
that the strategy changes, you know,

344
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,520
on a very regular basis

345
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,800
as the product is changing,

346
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,320
as the team and the world

347
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,240
is obviously changing,

348
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,840
your strategy should be changing.

349
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,720
Is this something that you recommend

350
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,160
thinking from the get go

351
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,440
as you're building the product,

352
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,800
already understanding

353
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,360
this is the strategy

354
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
of how I'm going to get it

355
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,120
to the customer?

356
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,040
Or is this at a later stage?

357
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,400
When does it really become

358
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,640
a crucial part of the company,

359
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,360
this Go-to-Market?

360
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,480
So, I think of it in stages, right?

361
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:54,200
When you were first starting

362
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,000
to conceive the product,

363
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,480
those two questions of

364
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,480
what problem and for whom,

365
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,920
we're going to be really important.

366
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,840
Because they influence

367
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,840
how you design the product.

368
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,480
They influence

369
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,960
how the user interacts with it.

370
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,360
They influence how much you have to plan

371
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,400
to invest in sales and wholesale support,

372
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,640
how you're going to reach that customer.

373
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,360
There's a lot of decisions

374
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,480
that cascade down from those few.

375
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,000
Right.

376
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,120
And so, I would say start thinking about

377
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,520
that really early

378
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,560
because it's going to influence

379
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,320
how much cash you need

380
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,120
and who your competitors are and so on.

381
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,400
So, I would say from the get go.

382
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,000
And then you're going to refine,

383
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,320
you're going to iterate your packaging.

384
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,680
Pricing is going to change.

385
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,640
A lot of things are going to change.

386
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,320
But you've got to have that necessarily.

387
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,600
So, the next question that I have is,

388
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,160
I'm thinking of myself

389
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,840
creating a startup in a few months

390
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,120
with some really great friends

391
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,480
from Stanford, from the Army

392
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,680
or wherever, you know,

393
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,840
we're going to be sitting around,

394
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,120
we are we're going to build, hopefully,

395
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,960
a great product,

396
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,880
and none of us have any experience

397
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,000
in supply chains

398
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,800
and Go-to-Market strategies,

399
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,440
and even thinking about what it takes

400
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,520
to bring a product there,

401
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,320
and obviously, you know,

402
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,960
when we're two weeks old

403
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,120
or two months old,

404
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,720
we're probably not going to bring in

405
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,560
an outside executive to come and do

406
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,822
our Go-to-Market strategy

407
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:17,680
from the get go.

408
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,720
So, how do you balance

409
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,960
your lack of experience

410
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,520
with the need to have some strategy

411
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,040
playing out?

412
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,480
It's a really easy thing.

413
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,720
You go talk to customers.

414
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:31,880
Right?

415
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,000
They will tell you.

416
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,560
Don't ever try to do

417
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,800
any piece of Go-to-Market,

418
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,720
even the really early guesses

419
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,000
in the four walls.

420
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,880
The best thing that a team can do

421
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,503
is just go,

422
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:52,006
really understand  the customers

423
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,280
you think you'll have.

424
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,520
Talk to them about what problem,

425
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,280
ask a lot of questions,

426
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,160
they will tell you.

427
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,840
You don't need an outside expert.

428
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,720
You don't need to hire an expensive CMO,

429
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,520
whatever it may be.

430
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,920
Just go validate, validate

431
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,280
and then go validate again.

432
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:10,720
Right.

433
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,320
So, one of the things that,

434
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,840
that you said earlier is that

435
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,920
there is a clear distinction

436
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,400
between Go-to-Market and marketing.

437
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,560
And that's something that

438
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,200
I guess is often confused

439
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,840
between the two.

440
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,280
That your marketing strategy

441
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,880
is not necessarily

442
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,880
the Go-to-Market strategy and vice versa.

443
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,120
Right?

444
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,440
I would say Go-to-Market

445
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,360
is just a broader set of decision.

446
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,160
Okay.

447
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,240
Marketing,

448
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,280
I joke that the M word

449
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,160
should be actually banned.

450
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,040
Because it means

451
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,080
so many different things.

452
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,840
Right?

453
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,080
Right.

454
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,040
But ultimately, marketing,

455
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,840
typically is about generating demand

456
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,720
for your product.

457
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,080
But there are a lot of other things

458
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,680
that impact the customer experience.

459
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,640
I'll give you an example.

460
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,880
Look at Apple Computer.

461
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,600
Apple Computer,

462
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,000
you know, when Steve Jobs started,

463
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,280
he understood instinctively

464
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,520
that it's not just about

465
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,600
the functionality of the computer.

466
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,040
It's about the experience.

467
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,160
It's about the interface.

468
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,000
It's about the packaging.

469
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,400
When later on, when they open stores,

470
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,160
it was about every single,

471
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,520
every single thing was in that stuff.

472
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:21,960
Right?

473
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:28,040
So, the marketing are the amazing ads,

474
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,160
the word of mouth, and so on.

475
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,440
But Go-to-Market is everything.

476
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,160
It's the decision of

477
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,880
how you're going to distribute

478
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,120
and of having an apple expert

479
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,840
within a Best Buy store, for example.

480
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,080
Right.

481
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,840
There's a lot of things around us that

482
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,640
it's kind of how to build an ecosystem

483
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,920
of partners and developers.

484
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,800
That's all part of Go-to-Market.

485
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,200
Who holds the responsibility

486
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,400
of the Go-to-Market strategy

487
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,040
within our organization,

488
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,120
even as it scales

489
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,480
to tens of thousands of people,

490
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,520
who holds that responsibility?

491
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,120
So, I think it's usually

492
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,080
the chief marketing officer.

493
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,720
Okay.

494
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,160
But it really is

495
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,480
an executive team discussion,

496
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,000
because you have strategic alliances

497
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,920
and product and so on

498
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,880
that also have to be very engaged.

499
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,360
Customer experience now

500
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,880
is usually a separate function.

501
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,440
Wonderful.

502
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,160
So, Lilia, there are so many more topics

503
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,840
that we can discuss.

504
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,800
But I also want to make sure

505
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,040
to hear a little bit about

506
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,280
the book that you wrote,

507
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,520
and some more insights

508
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,440
that you've gained from that,

509
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,720
before I ask you my favorite question

510
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,320
of the interview.

511
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,400
Yeah.

512
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,640
So, the book I wrote is,

513
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,440
42 Rules for Growing Enterprise Revenue.

514
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,000
A lot of rules.

515
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,120
42.

516
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,920
And if you're a fan of Douglas Adams,

517
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,840
you know why 42.

518
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,760
So, why 42?

519
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,160
Because it's the answer to life,

520
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,520
the universe and everything,

521
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,880
Yeah. The meaning of life.

522
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,320
So, it's a distillation really

523
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,760
of the thinking processes and frameworks

524
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,480
that I had used both in my

525
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,960
operational roles and with clients.

526
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,520
And it was a great opportunity

527
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,280
to kind of think through

528
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,800
how do I think about solutions,

529
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,080
how do I think about selecting markets,

530
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,720
how do I think about

531
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,480
relationships with customers

532
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,160
and customer relevance and value.

533
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,480
So, it's a very, you know,

534
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,080
each rule is like two pages.

535
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,320
It's a really quick read.

536
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,040
There's a lot of

537
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,360
different frameworks in there

538
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,200
and it was a lot of fun to write.

539
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,080
I'm sure. Was there a specific trigger

540
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,760
to writing it?

541
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,840
Did you see some pattern forming?

542
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,680
Or is these mainly insights

543
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,640
that you've gained over the years

544
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,360
that you just had to put on paper

545
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,320
and send it to the world?

546
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,680
Well, the trigger was

547
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,200
the publisher approached me and said,

548
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,280
"Write a book."

549
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,760
Okay. That's an amazing trigger.

550
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,400
Yeah. It's a great trigger.

551
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,400
And they already had kind of a format

552
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,560
that you had to follow.

553
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't know that I would have written it

554
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,800
quite that way.

555
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,720
I just started from scratch.

556
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,840
But it actually,

557
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,040
when you have to provide an idea

558
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,440
in whatever it is,

559
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,320
600 words to small pages,

560
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,920
you get very, very focused

561
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,000
on the core thing.

562
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,720
100%.

563
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,160
I have to mention to reflect back,

564
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,120
I recently launched a book about

565
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,080
youth entrepreneurship

566
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,320
and some personal experiences.

567
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,960
There was no word limit,

568
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,400
there was no structure.

569
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,920
And it was a very interesting experience,

570
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,760
very different, I guess,

571
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,920
that for me it was just

572
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,920
a plain blank page,

573
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,960
just write the story

574
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,560
and then condense it to sound good.

575
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,840
Now that you're mentioning

576
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,280
this word limit,

577
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,480
I almost wish

578
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,400
I had imposed a word limit on myself

579
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,800
so that I could even condense it more

580
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,240
and feel that I'm focusing more

581
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,800
on these ideas.

582
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,560
But it's a little bit late.

583
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,040
And the book is available,

584
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,440
I'm guessing, on Amazon, to purchase?

585
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,240
Yeah. Yeah.

586
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,240
It's on any online bookstore.

587
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,840
Wonderful.

588
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,240
Okay. So, the 42 rules.

589
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,280
I'm excited to take a look at it myself.

590
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,560
Lilia, I want to thank you

591
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,080
for being so generous with your time.

592
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,280
Thank you for sharing your insights

593
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,520
both about your journey

594
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,280
from the bunny suit,

595
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,640
all the way to the Shirman group

596
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,560
and your expertise on selecting markets

597
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,600
and Go-to-Market strategy.

598
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,779
And in general,

599
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:21,760
how companies work and operate.

600
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,880
This is exactly why I'm doing this show,

601
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,800
to learn from experts like yourself

602
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,280
that have been, have seen so much.

603
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,800
That a lot of the mistakes

604
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,560
that you've perhaps observed

605
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,200
or the successes you've observed,

606
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,120
as a young entrepreneur,

607
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,200
I can now take that those lessons with me

608
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,160
and hopefully make less of them

609
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,360
on my journey.

610
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,520
So, thank you for that.

611
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,720
And before we leave,

612
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,040
I have to ask you for three words

613
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,520
that you would use to describe yourself.

614
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,320
Oh, so this was,

615
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,240
you gave me a warning

616
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,200
and it was still hard.

617
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,320
Yeah.

618
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,560
It's not a single word,

619
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,000
but I would say,

620
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,400
short attention span.

621
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,520
Short attention span.

622
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,040
I like that.

623
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,720
I'd say I'm pretty creative.

624
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,440
And

625
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,080
even though I'm creative,

626
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,840
very structured.

627
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,280
I like to create boxes

628
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,560
and inter-relationships

629
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,720
and make very complex things

630
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,800
conceivable.

631
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,120
So, short attention span,

632
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,240
creative and structured,

633
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,560
I think those are,

634
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,800
that's a fantastic combination.

635
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,320
Lillia, thank you very, very much.

636
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,360
Thank you for the inspiration.

637
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,600
And stay safe and stay healthy.

638
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Thank you.
