1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,240
Omri Kriegel, thank you

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,000
for being on my show.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,960
How are you?

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,240
I'm good. Thank you very much.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,240
Thank you for having me.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,120
I am so honored to have you.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,560
I've heard so much about you

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,120
from my good friend Mickey,

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,240
and you've invested in him.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,320
And so, over the past, pretty long time,

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,520
I've been hearing about really,

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,680
a wonderful relationship

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,160
between an investor and a founder.

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,640
And I've been gaining inspiration

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,760
as to the type of investors

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,640
that I will look for

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,800
and the type of relationships

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,640
that I will want to have.

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,000
But Omri, I'd love to start this show.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,440
Before we get to your investment thesis

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,600
and how you operate,

22
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,080
I'd love to talk a little bit about you.

23
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,640
Because you have an unconventional story

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,240
of your life journey.

25
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,040
And given all the adversities

26
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,520
that you've had, you've come

27
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,080
to a really wonderful place

28
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,160
with I think,

29
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,960
some pretty remarkable insights.

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,360
So, Omri, why don't you take me

31
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,080
all the way back and however much

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,360
you feel comfortable sharing,

33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,080
I'd love to hear

34
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,080
about the different things

35
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,000
that happen along the way

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,560
and some of the insights

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,080
that you've gained from them.

38
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,280
Sure. So, again, thank you for having me.

39
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,840
And honored to be here.

40
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,320
Maybe I'll go a little bit

41
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,080
about my background

42
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,480
so just you have the full picture

43
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,400
about myself and where I'm coming from

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,880
and what's with my background and etc.

45
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,800
So, I was born in a tiny place

46
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,760
in the south of Israel,

47
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,320
actually in the desert called Arad.

48
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,160
This is where I was born and grew up.

49
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,320
I think it really was a wonderful place

50
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,040
that impacted me significantly,

51
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,760
mostly around values and morals.

52
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,360
And the people I grew up with

53
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,240
gave me the drive

54
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,320
and push to many of that

55
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,480
of, I guess, the values

56
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,400
that I'm currently aspiring for.

57
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,000
After a great childhood

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,560
down south in the desert,

59
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,200
I went to the Israeli army

60
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,960
and I served for, I guess,

61
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,920
around seven years

62
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,840
in the Israeli Navy SEALs.

63
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,320
So, that was

64
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,160
a very meaningful time for me.

65
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,040
I served there is a combat soldier.

66
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,560
Later as an officer, as a captain.

67
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,320
And I guess, this really shaped

68
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,320
my mentality around,

69
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,400
a never give up mentality, hard work

70
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,200
and things that comes with serving

71
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,440
in such a unit.

72
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,560
And then, I think that I went to do

73
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,680
my undergrad in IDC

74
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,440
which is the Interdisciplinary Center

75
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,320
in Herzliya and I studied

76
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,880
this administration entrepreneurship

77
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,480
in the Zell program.

78
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,240
And this gave me

79
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,520
some more understanding about business

80
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,520
and entrepreneurship in general.

81
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,400
Because I'm not coming

82
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,520
from this type of background at all.

83
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,920
Both of my parents worked down south

84
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,880
in the general works over there.

85
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,920
I had the best childhood,

86
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,760
but I don't have the business.

87
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,000
So, I didn't have the business

88
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,600
or entrepreneurial upbringing, sorry.

89
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,980
But Omri,

90
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,240
talk to me a little bit about Zell.

91
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,520
So Zell, I know very very well.

92
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,440
We had both Liat Aaronson on the show

93
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,480
who was the executive director,

94
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,040
I don't know if she was

95
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,920
the executive director

96
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,320
when you were in Zell,

97
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,600
but she a phenomenal person.

98
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,800
And so many other Israelis

99
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,120
that have been on this show,

100
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,520
Alon Halevy and Assaf Wand from Zell.

101
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,760
So, why go

102
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,360
to the Zell entrepreneurship program?

103
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,760
You're in combat in the IDF,

104
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,160
you grew up in Arad,

105
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,920
how do you end up deciding

106
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,160
that you want to be an entrepreneur?

107
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,880
So, you want to hear

108
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,320
the true story or just?

109
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,040
Of course.

110
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,560
So, I tell you the story.

111
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,680
The way it was, I was like every Israeli

112
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,920
after a military service,

113
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,360
I went to travel.

114
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,680
Some people go to the Far East,

115
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,840
I went to South America.

116
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,680
I already enrolled

117
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,720
to Tel Aviv University, to study the law.

118
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,600
And while I was in Bariloche

119
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,600
in the south of Argentina,

120
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,200
between one party to the other,

121
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,080
a friend of mine sent me an email saying,

122
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,240
"Hey, you was studying at the IDC?"

123
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,880
And he said, well,

124
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,400
"I think you would like this program."

125
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,200
"I think it fits you."

126
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,320
And I went to the website,

127
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,280
it was 2005, 2006

128
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,520
very different than what it is right now.

129
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,040
And I don't know, something ticked.

130
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,960
Something made me feel

131
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,520
that it's right for me.

132
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,600
The freedom around it and understanding

133
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,160
you're going to learn new things

134
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,400
and how to start your own business.

135
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,160
And I just said,

136
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,160
"This is for me."

137
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,040
And then I change my enrollment

138
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,760
and went to the IDC.

139
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,520
So, this was the thing

140
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,880
that made me go to study

141
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,600
in the Zell  program. Yeah.

142
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,840
So, how was your time

143
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,960
with the Zell program?

144
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,010
You starting out saying,

145
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,840
"Okay, I might be a law student."

146
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,120
You end up in an excellent

147
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,760
entrepreneurship world.

148
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,800
What are some things

149
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,880
that really excited you about it?

150
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,880
I think it's a combination

151
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,760
of the people around you.

152
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,040
And so, one is the people around you.

153
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,880
The second is the level of the program,

154
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,480
the level of the academic program

155
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,040
and the fact that

156
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,800
you can combine academic world

157
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,520
into real life hands on activities.

158
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,360
So, I think that this combination

159
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,040
was very unique for me.

160
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,560
The fact that I can learn and write

161
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,920
a business model on a business

162
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,920
that I'm trying to build myself,

163
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,400
which was a complete failure, by the way,

164
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,880
I think that it was

165
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,240
a great experience for me.

166
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,040
Incredible. Okay.

167
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,880
So, you're finished the IDC,

168
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,280
you finish this entrepreneurship program

169
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,720
and let'continue on the journey.

170
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
So, finished.

171
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,440
Then I I basically had an opportunity

172
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,720
to open a coffee shop in Israel.

173
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,840
So, I raised capital

174
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,680
for the first business that I did.

175
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,560
I raised capital,

176
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,920
significant amount of capital

177
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,120
for me back then

178
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,040
from external investors, from the US.

179
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,240
I brought a couple of local friends

180
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,360
that joined and invest on

181
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,760
as when we opened the coffee,

182
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,400
a big coffee shop in one of the biggest

183
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,000
entertainment centers in Israel,

184
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,600
in the cinema city in Rishon LeZion,

185
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,760
whoever knows it.

186
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,200
And I remember the night

187
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,160
that I signed the contract of this deal,

188
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,480
I didn't sleep for a whole night.

189
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,040
And I had a girlfriend back then asked me,

190
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,240
"Why didn't you sleep?"

191
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,960
"What's going on?"

192
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,550
"It's supposed to be a happy day."

193
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,040
I said,

194
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,960
"I can't believe I took responsibility

195
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,360
for other people's money."

196
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,520
"And if it's going to fail."

197
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,760
And a lot of, I won't say insecurities,

198
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,080
but things that are coming

199
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,840
with taking responsibility

200
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,600
and stepping up.

201
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,440
Right.

202
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,160
It sounds very healthy, by the way,

203
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,960
those feelings, right?

204
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,840
They are healthy.

205
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,280
They are healthy.

206
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,480
I think that even now, today,

207
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,520
when I will talk later

208
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,240
about what I did today,

209
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,720
but even now, when I do investment

210
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,320
and manage fund which

211
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,080
with other people's money or founders,

212
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,520
they take money or take investments from,

213
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,200
it comes with a lot of responsibility.

214
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,960
And I think it's good

215
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,800
to have this sense of, I won't say fear

216
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,440
because fear is not healthy.

217
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,880
But sense of responsibility,

218
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,560
this is something

219
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
that I think is very important.

220
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,720
So, I did that.

221
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,840
I did it for six months.

222
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,560
I didn't even know how to do coffee

223
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,120
in the machine.

224
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,840
I don't even know until today

225
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,360
how to make coffee or anything like that.

226
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,200
I wasn't at all on the operational side.

227
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,080
After six months,

228
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,880
I've joined the UK based startup,

229
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,040
which they were looking for

230
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,360
an Israeli country manager.

231
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,560
Which was quite interesting

232
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,720
because it's a UK startup,

233
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,880
it's two founders,

234
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,960
and the first role

235
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,040
that they wanted to hire

236
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,480
is someone from Israel

237
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,800
to be the country manager.

238
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,640
So, in a way, I was first employee,

239
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,400
country manager,

240
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,320
part of a company that just started.

241
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,720
It was exciting, right?

242
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,760
I had a very great experience over there.

243
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,560
I worked with the two founders.

244
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,120
We're very close until today.

245
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,000
Great investor behind them.

246
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,760
And yeah, it was my first basically

247
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,360
international experience.

248
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,080
Starting to work

249
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,400
for an international company

250
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,080
and learning how to operate

251
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,000
in the big world.

252
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,280
And I think it was a great school for me.

253
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,720
And the company did well later on.

254
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,000
But I think it was

255
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,200
an exceptional experience.

256
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,000
During that time, when I was basically

257
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,640
starting the operations in Israel

258
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,000
and hired a team

259
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,160
and a lot of responsibility, again,

260
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,080
I had a very severe injury back then.

261
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,720
It was 2011

262
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,600
and I went to a party with friends

263
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,640
and I basically, I went with

264
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,120
a very good friend of mine,

265
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,160
girlfriend of mine for a night swim

266
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,920
after the party.

267
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,120
And I jumped in the bed

268
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,800
placed into shallow water,

269
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,400
and I basically broke my neck

270
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,560
and I was paralyzed for about, I guess,

271
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,360
I still am. I'm still injured.

272
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,040
And I have a lot.

273
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
I walk with crutches

274
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,360
and using sometimes wheelchair.

275
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,760
But I still suffer from the injury.

276
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
But I was in hospital

277
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,040
for about a year plus,

278
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,360
which was quite interesting.

279
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,520
Because I kept managing the company

280
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,280
from my bed in the hospital.

281
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,960
Really?

282
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,040
Yeah.

283
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,280
People came to do meetings

284
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,120
next to the bed.

285
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,240
And it was between rehabilitation,

286
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,000
to try to sleep,

287
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,520
to do other medical activities.

288
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,600
I try to kept my sanity

289
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,720
and to keep working.

290
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,120
It wasn't ideal, but I still try

291
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:33,160
to keep it a level of a routine in a way.

292
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,960
What was the hardest part

293
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,640
if you look back at that year and a half?

294
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,520
So, obviously,

295
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,280
there are so many difficulties

296
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,600
that come with such an injury,

297
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
whether it's the paralysis

298
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,360
of not being able

299
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,440
to go out of the hospital;

300
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
or not being able to be

301
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,880
as efficient as you want at work;

302
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,520
or maybe in the relationship

303
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,640
with your friend and your loved one;

304
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,280
so, when looking back,

305
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,120
what were some really difficult things

306
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,360
that you feel that,

307
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,920
I obviously won't be able

308
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,000
to really understand

309
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,400
through a conversation like this?

310
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,840
So, I think the biggest challenges were,

311
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,880
first of all, I felt.

312
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,320
I think that the biggest challenges

313
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,480
were to understand

314
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,920
that my life have changed completely

315
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,160
and to accept it.

316
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,920
To accept that was something

317
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,160
that wasn't easy.

318
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,040
Just imagine yourself.

319
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,440
Back then, I was 30 years old,

320
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,640
managing a company in a very young age,

321
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,720
dating beautiful girls,

322
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,920
doing a marathons, triathlons,

323
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,400
just super active physically,

324
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,600
and then suddenly completely paralyzed.

325
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,400
Neck down completely paralyzed

326
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,280
and then being fed, being washed,

327
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,160
taking me from the bed to the wheelchair

328
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,240
with a crane, it's losing

329
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,840
the whole sense of self, I guess,

330
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,880
or changing the sense of self in a way

331
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,880
was the most challenging thing, I guess.

332
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,320
In parallel to that, of course,

333
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,160
the feeling of disappointing my family;

334
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,840
and the worries about my future

335
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,920
and how it's going to look like;

336
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,840
and finding my friends

337
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,720
and everyone around me,

338
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,080
I think this was

339
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,760
a very big challenge back then.

340
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
And so, you finish a year and a half,

341
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,360
you come out of the hospital.

342
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,760
Obviously nine years later,

343
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,960
you're still dealing with the injury,

344
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,360
but you went back

345
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,440
to a lot of the original life

346
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,640
that you had before then.

347
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,560
And so, let's continue then from that.

348
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,600
I think that after I was one year plus

349
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,360
in hospital,

350
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,640
then another year in full rehabilitation,

351
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,400
but then I said to myself

352
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,160
I was very lucky

353
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,280
to have solid family around me,

354
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,320
great friends, and feeling that

355
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,320
I'm going to overcome it.

356
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,880
And I fought really hard to overcome it.

357
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,640
And I always dreamt about doing,

358
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,920
decided to do an MBA abroad.

359
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,960
So, I was from that young child

360
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,240
that grew up in the south

361
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,440
who then suddenly you're in the Herzliya,

362
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,520
which is the center of Israel

363
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,600
and Zell program, and then I saw success.

364
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,400
And I wanted always to study abroad.

365
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,240
And the first thing that I did

366
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,800
after I had my recovery

367
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,800
was to basically apply for an MBA abroad.

368
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,120
And I went to do an MBA

369
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,360
in Chicago Business School.

370
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,600
So, I did that 2014 to 2016.

371
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,000
It was a great experience.

372
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,280
Suddenly, I'm studying with

373
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,480
so many interesting people, global people.

374
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,560
Feeling that I'm being exposed

375
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,440
to new cultures,

376
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,160
new ways of making business.

377
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,600
So, I really really enjoy that period.

378
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,000
In parallel to that, I established

379
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,800
another Israeli entity

380
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,080
for a UK based company.

381
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,760
So, I did that

382
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,760
for about another two years.

383
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,200
Then I went to work abroad

384
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,520
in New York for a tech company

385
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,160
where I did business development

386
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,400
for the company after my MBA.

387
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,520
But I guess from 2014, '15,

388
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,640
I'm looking for investments

389
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,360
and I'm doing due diligence and sourcing,

390
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,400
screening Israeli early stage companies

391
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,040
for high net individuals,

392
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,440
family offices from abroad.

393
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,600
And we did a couple of investments.

394
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,360
And in 2018, I've established

395
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,440
a Homeward Ventures,

396
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,240
which is a fund that invests

397
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,080
in the early stages startups in Israel.

398
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,000
But not only, we've invested also

399
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,280
in American companies and others.

400
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,440
So, we're open. We're not necessarily

401
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,960
geographically focused.

402
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,920
And I really enjoy it.

403
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,000
This is what I do since 2018.

404
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,880
And it's a great experience.

405
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,720
And I learned a lot.

406
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,640
And I really really like it.

407
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,040
Amazing. Amazing.

408
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,360
So, I think it's just inspiring

409
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,960
that from an upbringing

410
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,080
that is not necessarily

411
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,840
the most entrepreneurial environment

412
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,720
that you have,

413
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,480
you come through the Israeli military;

414
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,400
you go to the IDC;

415
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,920
you go to the Zell program;

416
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,000
you study entrepreneurship

417
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,920
more professionally

418
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,280
through creating businesses

419
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,200
either failed or successful,

420
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,840
it doesn't really matter.

421
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,600
But you go to business school and now,

422
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,280
you're a renowned investor in Israel.

423
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,360
But I also want to understand a little bit

424
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,840
about some of the key takeaways

425
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,360
that you have from either

426
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,280
your upbringing, your military service,

427
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,920
the adversities that you've had.

428
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,240
And I know that there were more

429
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,840
than we spoke about here.

430
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,760
But they're very significant.

431
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,240
And I'm sure they are

432
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,080
a very significant part of your identity.

433
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,840
And I think this is

434
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,080
a very special episode for me,

435
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,320
because unlike a lot of other guests here,

436
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,080
it's a very special story that

437
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,320
a lot of people grow up

438
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,040
in a very entrepreneurial household,

439
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,640
or a very technological households

440
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,520
and they grow into this environment,

441
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,400
they don't put themselves there,

442
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,520
they're placed there.

443
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,880
And you inserted yourself

444
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,080
into a lot of these arenas,

445
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,000
whether it's business school

446
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,520
or it's the Zell program

447
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,840
or creating a business.

448
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,800
So, I'd love to hear

449
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,040
a little bit of reflection from you

450
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,800
about that upbringing and perhaps,

451
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,040
what you would tell your younger self

452
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,200
or what you would tell other young teens

453
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,920
around the world

454
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,120
who don't necessarily have

455
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,800
the opportunities presented to them

456
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,280
like you had?

457
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,720
Well, I think that you can find

458
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,400
entrepreneurial spirit work,

459
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,120
like step up mentality

460
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,920
in every culture where you come from.

461
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,480
I remember my grandmother

462
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,560
when I was young,

463
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,760
I think that this is something

464
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,520
that many old people in Israel

465
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:26,920
used to do.

466
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,560
But she used to buy cheese

467
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,560
that comes in plastic cups,

468
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,440
and after we finished those cream cheese,

469
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,320
she used to wash them

470
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,200
and she used to put a syrup in there

471
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,120
for drinking and stuff.

472
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,040
So, I think entrepreneurial

473
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,880
and thinking out of the box mentality

474
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,120
is something that you can observe

475
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,160
everywhere.

476
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,640
It relates to the environment

477
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,240
that you're at,

478
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,600
which Israeli is a very supportive

479
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,040
culture to that.

480
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,880
But it can come from your surroundings.

481
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,240
But a lot of it also should, I think,

482
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,160
or should is a hard word,

483
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,680
but I think can come

484
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,320
from your inner world and personality

485
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:09,280
to have a mentality or to feel that

486
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,040
everything is possible.

487
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,000
I really believe in that.

488
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,600
I really believe in dreaming big.

489
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,560
I really believe

490
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,200
that everything is possible.

491
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,800
Sky is the limit.

492
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,960
All these cliches,

493
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,320
they are not, in my opinion,

494
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,800
anyway, this is how my life

495
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,000
proved me so far.

496
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,120
I always dreamt about

497
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,680
being in the Israeli Navy SEAL,

498
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,400
but I was a chubby boy.

499
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
So, I did a diet at the age of 16

500
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,360
and I lost 15 kilos.

501
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,920
And I know I was strong

502
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,160
but I decided, so this is something

503
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,920
that I did back then,

504
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,720
or going into the Zell program,

505
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,840
which I had to improve some grades

506
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,000
or learning to walk again

507
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,960
with something that

508
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,240
I set myself a goal. I said,

509
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,280
"I'm going to learn to walk again."

510
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,320
"I'll be able to walk again."

511
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
"Maybe I can't walk as I used to walk,

512
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,960
but it's lucky

513
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,000
that we do this interview,"

514
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,840
what I said.

515
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:06,390
But still, I think that setting high goals

516
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,480
and having dream big and target high,

517
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,040
I think is someone that everyone can have.

518
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,760
And if you do so, I believe

519
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,320
that life will show you the way

520
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,640
and things can happen

521
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,720
even if you're not coming

522
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,120
from the most obvious upbringing possible.

523
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,760
I think that's amazing.

524
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,920
But at the end,

525
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,560
a lot of people face adversity,

526
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,000
a lot of people

527
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,560
are trying different things

528
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,120
and they're getting knocked down

529
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,040
and everybody says,

530
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,840
"Just get back up."

531
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,720
"Just do it again."

532
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,440
The knocking down that you had,

533
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,640
specifically, with that injury

534
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,400
and literally being paralyzed,

535
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,560
not being able to continue

536
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,920
doing the marathons and triathlons;

537
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,080
not being able to operate

538
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,440
as efficiently as you could

539
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,200
as you were in the peak of your years,

540
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,760
that's a dramatic knocking down.

541
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,440
What do you tell yourself at that point

542
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,200
when you're in the bed in the hospital

543
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,720
and you have people coming to you

544
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,280
for meetings and you must feel inside

545
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,240
that you're not fulfilling

546
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,080
your potential at that point?

547
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,960
I'm imagining that it's something

548
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,840
that is constantly with you.

549
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,480
So, how do you go through

550
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,760
that year plus,

551
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,800
what do you tell yourself in your mind?

552
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,200
And obviously that's something

553
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,800
that a lot of people

554
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,880
that are getting knocked down

555
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,160
could tell themselves, but for you,

556
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,200
it was a much more dramatic scenario.

557
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,400
I'll tell you a story.

558
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,240
I think maybe it will encapsulate

559
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,720
what my thinking around that.

560
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,240
A few nights after I was woke up,

561
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,440
I was in a coma for a few days

562
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,030
and then, later I woke up.

563
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,280
A few days after I woke up,

564
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,400
I couldn't move anything.

565
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,440
I was in bed completely

566
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,320
and I had a high fever.

567
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,680
And it was midnight or maybe one, 2 a.m.

568
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,640
I was sleeping in the bed

569
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,280
in the hospital in the intensive care,

570
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,920
and my mother was just next to me.

571
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,440
And I cried. I woke up and I cried.

572
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,000
And I didn't think that she will hear me.

573
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,760
And she asked me,

574
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
"Omri, what happened?"

575
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,440
And I told her,

576
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,120
"Well, Mom, I ruined my life."

577
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,960
"I ruined your life."

578
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,920
"I ruined my brother's life."

579
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
"I ruined everyone's life."

580
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,240
"Life is ruined."

581
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,880
And she told me,

582
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,320
"Well, as long as we are together

583
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,160
and you are here,

584
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,880
everything's going to be okay."

585
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,560
And from a mother perspective,

586
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,040
to think that okay,

587
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,200
she could have lost her son

588
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,520
a few hours ago

589
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,840
or a few days ago, or whatever,

590
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,400
and now he's here, then nothing is as bad.

591
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,200
So, I think that I always tried

592
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,040
and I still aspire to try,

593
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,960
obviously, I failed sometimes,

594
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,240
but I always try to grab or hold

595
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,480
into the positive and good things in life

596
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,680
and try to find the path around that.

597
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,800
Yeah, it was very easy for me

598
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,840
to be there and say,

599
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,160
"Okay, my life is ruined."

600
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,880
"I'm going to give up and that's it."

601
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,360
"And it's done."

602
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,520
But I decided to choose the other path.

603
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,400
To believe in myself,

604
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,600
to believe that despite the changes,

605
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,880
things will be OK.

606
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,000
And by the way, this is something

607
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,520
that I say to entrepreneurs many times.

608
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,560
Many times you can hit a wall

609
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,080
or you need to do changes in your plans

610
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,040
as entrepreneurs.

611
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,680
Business plan, your personal life,

612
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,840
whatever.

613
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,680
And I think that changes

614
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,120
are not always necessarily bad.

615
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,760
I can also see the good things

616
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,960
that happened since my injury.

617
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,880
And if you ask me today,

618
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,160
"If I throw you back ten years ago,

619
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,200
would you change?"

620
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,320
"Would you jump?"

621
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:21,880
I don't know.

622
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,520
I have a child today.

623
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,960
So many good things happened since.

624
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,400
So, I have work that I like.

625
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,040
I have a partner. And everything is,

626
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,800
So, I think that focusing on the positive

627
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,520
and on the good is the right thing to do

628
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,680
in any aspect, in any element in life.

629
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,800
Omri, this was inspiring.

630
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,480
Thank you.

631
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,440
And I'm very excited

632
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,080
to continue getting to know you better

633
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,840
and hopefully continue maintaining

634
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,720
this relationship, both friendship

635
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,560
and professionally,

636
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,240
because I just love your outlook.

637
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,040
And I grew up throughout high school,

638
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,320
with Dan Ariely as also a role model.

639
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,040
And I got a chance to work with him later.

640
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,400
He, too, he went through

641
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,000
some very very difficult adversity

642
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,040
at the age of 17.

643
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,040
He wanted to be a pilot in the Air Force.

644
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,520
He wanted to do different things.

645
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,840
Let's give Dan a brownie point here

646
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,320
because I know Dan well.

647
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,960
And after I had recovery done was

648
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,680
we had a lot of conversations

649
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,040
about injuries, etc.

650
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,640
And he really gave me a lot of support

651
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,120
and he backed a lot of my recovery.

652
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,440
That's wonderful.

653
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,000
And so, I get so much inspiration

654
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,640
from the two of you.

655
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,400
Right before we leave,

656
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
Omri, I want to thank you again

657
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,560
for being so generous with your time.

658
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,160
I know that you are traveling right now.

659
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,160
And so, thank you

660
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,080
for taking the time to do this.

661
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,720
But I need three words that you would use

662
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,960
to describe yourself.

663
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,440
And I'm going to throw in the first one.

664
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,880
Resilient is the first one.

665
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,240
You have two left, i'm sorry.

666
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,240
I never did this,

667
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,160
but I'm going to give you the first one.

668
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,760
I'm going to go on the phrase.

669
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,160
Well, better I'm going to go on a phrase

670
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,920
rather than words.

671
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,880
I think it's going to be, never give up.

672
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,560
Maybe that's never give up.

673
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,520
But if you want three words,

674
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
we can go with that as well

675
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,480
however you wish.

676
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,080
No no no.

677
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,160
Never give up is wonderful

678
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,240
Omri, toda raba.

679
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,520
Thank you very very much.

680
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,880
Thank you. Thank you for having me.

681
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,760
I look forward to continue

682
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,560
getting to know each other.

683
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,120
Thank you.

684
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,320
Same here. Thank you very much.

685
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,640
Bye bye.
