1 Keren, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? Great. Thank you for having me. You know just a few months ago, we met for coffee back in Israel. Who would have imagined that here we are in the middle of May, trying to figure out how the world is gonna look like next month? Right. Right. I couldn’t imagine. I couldn’t imagine. Now, Keren, you have a particularly interesting story. And I'm very excited to talk about one of the programs that you founded called Woman2Woman, a leadership excellence program that helps women both from the tech units. But also, from all across the industry. A really extraordinary women all over Israel. To take great strides toward becoming better leaders. And having prominent positions in the industry. Can you tell me a little bit about where you come from? And how this idea of woman2woman actually came about? Sure, so I'm a 8200 graduate. And so, in the unit we have 50% female soldiers. Which is something that usually surprises people who didn’t serve in the unit. Because when you hear about successful entrepreneurs or people who go out to a leadership positions in Israel you usually hear about men. So, there are 50% female. And what we found out, one of the co-founders, with me and two other founders. And what we found out is that, there are two factors that actually, that they are putting women in a different stage. Right? So, first is that women usually take a step back. Even before they think about their career and having a family. So, even when they choose what to study. Or where to go. Or what to do in their life. And that the second thing is that we have others lack of women that could be role models in Israel. So, women that gets to high level positions and are willing to pass it forward. So, that's how we founded woman2woman. With the idea of creating the next generation female leaders in Israel. Women with all industries. So, let's dive a little bit deeper. So, talk to me a little bit about what does it take to create a leadership program? And also, what skills do you think are missing to help bridge that gap? Skills that you're trying to promote through woman2woman? So, I think that women, and again generally, I think there are at least good as men. Of course there are a lot better. Keren, you know, that's not even a question you know. Thank you. So, I think that there are things that, again generally, women are not that good at. And it goes to soft skills that relate to negotiation or presentation or even presenting themselves in a way. Like talking about all of the successful things that they have done. And their attributes. So, it’s difficult for women to talk about that. And we feel that this is something that we need to work on with them. So, that's one thing. And also, understanding that they could do both. Like, having a successful career and a family. Which is something that if you look at the last generation, you know our parents. So, usually women took different role in the house, right? So, right now we wanted to change that. And it's actually the first time, the first generation that we really wanna have equal opportunities. And that's something that is not really happening even in 2020. Yeah. You know, I mean right now it's very evident. You have women like Sheryl Sandberg, and Rona Segev, and [--] That are really you know, pioneers. And they are doing extraordinary things. But you also have these crazy stories of Marissa Meyer. You know back then the CEO of Yahoo, who gives birth and I think the Meet was on the-- Three days. Three days she was in the office. I mean, wow. And I'm sure you have to find some balance, right? I can’t imagine that it can be assumed that either the women or the men will come to the office three days after giving birth. But what can you do to sort of level the gap between the maternity leave of the women and that of the father? That's a great point. So, first I believe that every woman has her own choice, right? And if she thinks that she can come back to the office after a day or two days or three days, that's fine Because she needs to feel good with herself. And you know, women experience this maternity leave in different ways. Which is okay. And I think that part of asking for equality and equal opportunities, is also understanding that women are also different among themselves. According to what they believe and what they've seen. The way they feel about family. And we really need to accept that. We really need to give, each woman her own choice to have and navigate her life and course this to major things which are career and her own professional life. So, that's first. Second, I agree that we have missing women that are pioneers. And also, you know programs. We have Orna Berry and we have [--]. Really amazing women. And they are really putting their time in order to help younger women which is amazing in my opinion. And they also talk about their difficulties. Which there are a lot of them. Also, in their balance, you know work, and family, and what they have done in order to balance that. Completely. And you also see other companies in the industry who are taking the reverse approach and they're saying, "Why is it that women only are expected to spend time with the family? Men, the fathers should be there just as much, just as long as the women." And I believe that both Google and Facebook, they took their step in equalizing the paid vacation leave after giving birth. So talk to me a little about woman2woman. How does the program actually run? Because these women are already, they are excellent candidate for continuing in leadership positions. They are very busy. Is it structured like an EMBA sort of? Or is that a meet-up base? How does it work? So the program is about six-month. During this six-month we have one on one mentoring Like one on one mentorship. So, we have these mentors. Amazing mentors on one side and the younger women on the other side. Right. And they are meeting each other through this six-month. And besides that, we have a lot of meet-ups for the mentors and the mentees. So, with the mentees we're working as I said about their soft skills. And even creating their path, right? So, where they wanna go when they wanna get this kind of positions, what they wanna achieve family-wise, and how do they really navigate their career. And we're working with them on that. And then on the mentor side, we also work on creating a very very very very influential group of women in high leadership positions. That are working in order to promote women inter-organizations. Right. And this mentorship, it's actually what's unique about it is that you're forming this really incredible relationships with some of the most prominent women in the Israeli ecosystem. And it's not just a one of, "Hey, give me an hour coffee and let me share some of my dilemmas." You're actually building these intense relationships where they go as far to help their mentees progress to the C-level and executive positions. Is that right? Right. Right. What we understood is that even in 2020, even though we have very very talented women around the age of 30 let's say, when you look at this point. So, even so that they are so talented, and they wanna get to the C-Levels positions, not all of them are going to get there. And not because they are not good enough. It's just because of life, right? Because they would have much more, it would be much more difficult for them. So, what we do is just we take them hand by hand and we just make sure that they are reaching in those positions. Okay. So how many cycles has this program gone through? And how many women have gone through this program? So, we've already had four cycles. And more than 160 mentees. Wonderful. 160 mentees. That's a lot of data. Am a data guy. I love looking at data. And extrapolating to some of the bigger picture of questions. And what have you learned over these 160 mentees? All extraordinary women to begin with. I'm sure some of them went on to already become C-Level executives. Some of them are on their way. Some of them perhaps have realized that they don’t actually want to. Or maybe they are not fit for that. I'm sure that's a possibility too. What earned secrets have you learn as the founder of this, looking at these 160 women? So, I think that I've learned that how important it is to have a community. That supports you. So, some of them are coming from different backgrounds. And different ethnicities, right. So, some of them are Haredi and some of them are non. And some of them different communities in Israel. You have parading them in the program? Yeah. We do. Really. Wow. Okay. Which is amazing. Yup. And you know, arm and hammer, like different communities. And not all of them are coming from a background that really supports them and pushes them. So, I feel like having this community. I'm talking about the mentees themselves. Not the mentors. So, having this community of women that help each other, and open doors for each other. This is something amazing. I've heard one of our [--]. So, she told me like, she called, I gave her a number of one of our alumni from the first cycle. And I didn’t tell her that I'm giving her number. So, she called and the other person on the line. So, she was like, "Are you want to be an alumni? Okay. I will help you. I will do whatever you need. I will help you in whatever I can." So, they are really helping each other. And I think that's a gift. Oh. That one's incredible. Yeah. I think about this question a lot as the chicken and the egg sort of. Where you expect on one hand. I'm looking now on the cyberspace in 8200 where even though the unit as a whole has an equal ratio of male to females. In the cyberspace, I think it's more like 9:1 male to female. Which is also, there are a lot of programs trying to help make that transition more to equality. But what I were thinking about, and I had a third of my team where females. So, we're actually broke the law that for the rest of them and was very proud of. And I kept thinking that, like "Wow". I can imagine the struggle of even when you get a fantastic woman engineer or analyst or whatever to come in. She has to go. And I'll sit in a room, with seven, eight other guys with very few representation of other women. That's very intimidating and I'm thinking back to high school. Where you have CS classrooms filled with men. That's intimidating to go and be the one out. And I'm almost wondering how do we break the cycle where we stop this intimidation and we just level the plain field. Very good question. So, I think of that, what we do is we work with companies in Israel. So, exactly as you said. Being the only woman at the room is very difficult. It's very hard. So, were working with companies in order to have them change the way that they are thinking about. Even according women. We're talking to managers that are men about the differences and they are working and how they are performing the interviews. And then, like even the sitting. And what happens when a woman is pregnant? So, sometimes she needs to have a parking space sometimes. And sometimes, there are different things that a woman needs or that would help her achieve her potential, right? So, were really working with companies. In order to help them create an environment that enables women to get to the high-level positions. Wonderful. Keren, we have just about five minutes left. And I’d love to use this time to learn a little bit more about you. So, tell me where do you come from? You did 8200. You founded this incredible organization that is now continuing to do great things. But you're also working full time in the industry. So, tell me a little bit about what interest you? And what excites you? So, I'm really excited about changing things that I don’t really agree with. So, it also relates to women. And to deal with woman equality and to other communities in Israel that are currently not having the same representation as they should have. In the industry. So that's something that really excites me. And I really, so I'm working in the finance industry. In the cybersecurity in Australia. A finance position. I really love that. I really like the combination of thinking about the next product and how you go to the market and how to get money out of that. So, I really like that. I think that's it. So, tell me a little bit about how do you balance these things? So, you're running this organization that takes a lot of time to work on. It's a lot of relationship building. A lot of meetings and effort. I know from organizing a hackathon event, which are one-time events that facilitates these relationships. That takes a lot of effort. At the same time, you're working full time at a company. And you're also probably working on other stuff that you're excited about. How do you balance everything? So, I think that I found a way that also, like when I'm coming to project, I really understand what it takes. Like how many hours I'm going to spend on that. I don’t have weekends. I have a wonderful husband. And amazing friends and family. They are very supportive. And that's something that really helps. And I also think that once you do something that you really love and you care about. And so, your life, everything is sort in a better way. Everything is okay. So, if I asked you how many hours a week do you work? Because you know, full time jobs takes 40 hours. But you're actually saying that, "I don’t work for 40 hours." Technically, I work for much more but I don't consider that as work. Right. Right. Correct. So, usually I do 30 hours of volunteering a week. And I work 50 hours or more of work. How do you balance 30 hours? Like I don’t sleep much. Where do you volunteer? What is your volunteer work? So, woman2woman takes a lot of time. We're now 12 women at the team. Which is amazing. But it still takes a lot of time. Is everybody volunteer? We have someone that is helping us and get full time job. But all the others are volunteering. And yeah. I do a lot of stuff that I really believe in. That's wonderful. How do you from the sidelines make sure that the quality remains as when you just started out? Because it's a very emotional, personal project. And I'm sure that you know sometimes there are decisions being made that you're not entirely happy with. Or that you don’t feel are the best. How do you balance now that you are also working on other stuff? Very good question. When I'll know the answer Ill get back to you. Wonderful So, it's hard. I tried to do compromises when I feel that I can do that. And keep the quality in the highest level in places where I feel we can compromise on. So, just balancing between our activities and things that we are doing in order to maintain the brand. And the amazing women that are coming to our program. Okay. That's wonderful. Keren, we are almost done. But I'd love to ask you my favorite question. The three words that best describe yourself. Or three words that one of 160 women who went through this wonderful program would describe you as. So, I think the three words to describe the program and what we're trying to do is like Create, Change, and Impact. I love it. Keren, thank you very very much. Toda raba. Stay safe. And I look forward to our next coffee back in Israel whenever that will be possible. Looking forward. Wonderful. Thank you. Take care.
