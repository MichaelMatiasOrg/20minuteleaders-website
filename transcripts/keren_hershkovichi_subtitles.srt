1
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:28,332
Keren, thank you so much for joining

2
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,299
me on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,566
How are you?

4
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:31,932
Great. Thank you for having me.

5
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:33,499
You know just a few months ago,

6
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,399
we met for coffee back in Israel.

7
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,266
Who would have imagined that

8
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:39,766
here we are in the middle of May,

9
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,799
trying to figure out how the world

10
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,166
is gonna look like next month?

11
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:45,066
Right. Right.

12
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:47,032
I couldn’t imagine.

13
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:47,799
I couldn’t imagine.

14
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,099
Now, Keren, you have a

15
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,599
particularly interesting story.

16
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,099
And I'm very excited to talk

17
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,032
about one of the programs that

18
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:56,666
you founded called Woman2Woman,

19
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,799
a leadership excellence program

20
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,366
that helps women both from

21
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:01,966
the tech units. But also, from

22
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:02,966
all across the industry.

23
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:04,399
A really extraordinary women

24
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,899
all over Israel.

25
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,499
To take great strides toward

26
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,532
becoming better leaders.

27
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:12,399
And having prominent positions

28
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,399
in the industry. Can you tell me

29
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,132
a little bit about

30
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:15,932
where you come from?

31
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,132
And how this idea of

32
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:18,999
woman2woman actually came about?

33
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,732
Sure, so I'm a 8200 graduate.

34
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:27,132
And so, in the unit we have

35
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:28,632
50% female soldiers.

36
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:30,166
Which is something that

37
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:32,232
usually surprises people

38
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:33,899
who didn’t serve in the unit.

39
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,499
Because when you hear about successful

40
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,366
entrepreneurs or people who go out

41
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:40,399
to a leadership positions in Israel

42
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,866
you usually hear about men.

43
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:46,099
So, there are 50% female.

44
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,899
And what we found out,

45
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,399
one of the co-founders,

46
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,699
with me and two other founders.

47
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,399
And what we found out is that,

48
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,066
there are two factors

49
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:02,599
that actually, that they are putting

50
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,766
women in a different stage. Right?

51
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:08,432
So, first is that women

52
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:10,399
usually take a step back.

53
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,266
Even before they think about

54
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,099
their career and having a family.

55
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,066
So, even when they choose

56
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:19,699
what to study. Or where to go.

57
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,699
Or what to do in their life.

58
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,799
And that the second thing is that

59
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,232
we have others lack of women

60
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:30,432
that could be role models in Israel.

61
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,032
So, women that gets to

62
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:33,999
high level positions and are

63
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,232
willing to pass it forward. So, that's

64
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:41,499
how we founded woman2woman.

65
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,466
With the idea of creating the next

66
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:45,199
generation female leaders in Israel.

67
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,599
Women with all industries.

68
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,232
So, let's dive a little bit deeper.

69
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:51,899
So, talk to me a little bit about

70
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,799
what does it take to create

71
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,199
a leadership program?

72
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,366
And also, what skills do you think

73
00:07:57,367 --> 00:07:59,632
are missing to help bridge that gap?

74
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:02,999
Skills that you're trying to promote

75
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,266
through woman2woman?

76
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:08,532
So, I think that women, and again

77
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:10,766
generally, I think there are at least

78
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:13,466
good as men.

79
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:14,266
Of course there are a lot better.

80
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:15,266
Keren, you know,

81
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:17,899
that's not even a question you know.

82
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,999
Thank you. So, I think that there are

83
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,132
things that, again generally,

84
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:28,099
women are not that good at.

85
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,999
And it goes to soft skills that

86
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,932
relate to negotiation or

87
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:36,799
presentation or even presenting

88
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,932
themselves in a way.

89
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:41,799
Like talking about all of the

90
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,166
successful things that they have done.

91
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:48,399
And their attributes. So, it’s difficult

92
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,032
for women to talk about that.

93
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:53,332
And we feel that this is something

94
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,799
that we need to work on with them.

95
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,866
So, that's one thing. And also,

96
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:00,599
understanding that they could do both.

97
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,066
Like, having a successful career

98
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:05,899
and a family. Which is something that

99
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,932
if you look at the last generation,

100
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:11,232
you know our parents.

101
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:15,899
So, usually women took different role

102
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,032
in the house, right? So, right now

103
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:21,232
we wanted to change that.

104
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:23,699
And it's actually the first time,

105
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,899
the first generation that we really

106
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,399
wanna have equal opportunities.

107
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,532
And that's something that is not

108
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:32,566
really happening even in 2020.

109
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,766
Yeah. You know, I mean right now

110
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,232
it's very evident. You have women

111
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:37,799
like Sheryl Sandberg, and Rona Segev,

112
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,932
and [--]

113
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:41,232
That are really you know, pioneers.

114
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:42,566
And they are doing

115
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:43,699
extraordinary things.

116
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,799
But you also have these crazy stories

117
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,399
of Marissa Meyer. You know

118
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,599
back then the CEO of Yahoo,

119
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,832
who gives birth and

120
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,132
I think the Meet was on the--

121
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,466
Three days.

122
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,732
Three days she was in the office.

123
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:58,232
I mean, wow. And I'm sure

124
00:09:58,233 --> 00:09:59,566
you have to find some balance, right?

125
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:03,199
I can’t imagine that it can be

126
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,432
assumed that either the women

127
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:06,266
or the men will come to the office

128
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:08,599
three days after giving birth.

129
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,232
But what can you do to sort of

130
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:13,032
level the gap between the

131
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:14,466
maternity leave of the women

132
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:15,932
and that of the father?

133
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:20,699
That's a great point. So, first

134
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,166
I believe that every woman

135
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,666
has her own choice, right?

136
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:30,166
And if she thinks that she can

137
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,966
come back to the office after a day

138
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:34,266
or two days or three days, that's fine

139
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,366
Because she needs to feel good

140
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:38,199
with herself. And you know,

141
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,399
women experience this

142
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,599
maternity leave in different ways.

143
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,232
Which is okay. And I think that

144
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:50,866
part of asking for equality

145
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:53,299
and equal opportunities,

146
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,066
is also understanding that women

147
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:58,299
are also different among themselves.

148
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,799
According to what they believe

149
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,866
and what they've seen.

150
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:03,466
The way they feel about family.

151
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:05,666
And we really need to accept that.

152
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:09,032
We really need to give, each woman

153
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:11,666
her own choice to have

154
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:14,032
and navigate her life

155
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:17,232
and course this to major things

156
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:19,066
which are career and her own

157
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:20,966
professional life. So, that's first.

158
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:23,332
Second, I agree that we have

159
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,532
missing women that are pioneers.

160
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:27,932
And also, you know programs.

161
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:29,632
We have Orna Berry

162
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:31,266
and we have [--].

163
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:32,932
Really amazing women.

164
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:36,032
And they are really putting their time

165
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:38,599
in order to help younger women

166
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,132
which is amazing in my opinion.

167
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,532
And they also talk

168
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,032
about their difficulties.

169
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:45,932
Which there are a lot of them.

170
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:50,199
Also, in their balance, you know work,

171
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,099
and family, and what they have done

172
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,366
in order to balance that.

173
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:55,366
Completely. And you also see

174
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:57,632
other companies in the industry

175
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,266
who are taking the reverse approach

176
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:00,099
and they're saying,

177
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,366
"Why is it that women only

178
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,899
are expected to spend time

179
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,266
with the family? Men, the fathers

180
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:08,666
should be there just as much,

181
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:09,732
just as long as the women."

182
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:11,299
And I believe that both Google

183
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,132
and Facebook, they took their step

184
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:18,099
in equalizing the paid vacation leave

185
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,732
after giving birth.

186
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,299
So talk to me a little about

187
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,132
woman2woman.

188
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:22,532
How does the program actually run?

189
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,032
Because these women are already,

190
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:26,732
they are excellent candidate for

191
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:27,966
continuing in leadership positions.

192
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:30,066
They are very busy. Is it structured

193
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:31,932
like an EMBA sort of?

194
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:33,932
Or is that a meet-up base?

195
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:34,466
How does it work?

196
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:38,466
So the program is about six-month.

197
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,999
During this six-month we have

198
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,432
one on one mentoring

199
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:44,166
Like one on one mentorship.

200
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:46,466
So, we have these mentors.

201
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:47,832
Amazing mentors on one side

202
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,832
and the younger women

203
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:51,532
on the other side.

204
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:52,399
Right.

205
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,899
And they are meeting each other

206
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,132
through this six-month.

207
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:58,132
And besides that, we have a lot of

208
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:00,932
meet-ups for the mentors

209
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:03,932
and the mentees. So, with the

210
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:04,766
mentees we're working

211
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:06,666
as I said about their soft skills.

212
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:10,866
And even creating their path, right?

213
00:13:10,867 --> 00:13:12,099
So, where they wanna go

214
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,166
when they wanna get this

215
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:15,399
kind of positions,

216
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,199
what they wanna achieve

217
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,832
family-wise, and how do they really

218
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,032
navigate their career.

219
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:24,266
And we're working with them on that.

220
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:25,766
And then on the mentor side,

221
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:28,532
we also work on creating a

222
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:30,999
very very very very influential

223
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,666
group of women in

224
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:34,999
high leadership positions.

225
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,566
That are working in order to promote

226
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,099
women inter-organizations.

227
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,666
Right. And this mentorship,

228
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,732
it's actually what's unique about it

229
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:44,766
is that you're forming this

230
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:46,066
really incredible relationships

231
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:47,566
with some of the most prominent

232
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,499
women in the Israeli ecosystem.

233
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,399
And it's not just a one of,

234
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,432
"Hey, give me an hour coffee

235
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,266
and let me share

236
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:55,299
some of my dilemmas."

237
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,499
You're actually building these

238
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,432
intense relationships where they go

239
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:02,632
as far to help their mentees progress

240
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,766
to the C-level and executive positions.

241
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:05,299
Is that right?

242
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,932
Right. Right.

243
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,899
What we understood is that

244
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,866
even in 2020, even though we have

245
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:14,832
very very talented women

246
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,866
around the age of 30 let's say,

247
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:17,966
when you look at this point.

248
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:21,199
So, even so that they are so talented,

249
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,899
and they wanna get to the

250
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,566
C-Levels positions, not all of them

251
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:27,632
are going to get there. And not

252
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,132
because they are not good enough.

253
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:32,132
It's just because of life, right?

254
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:34,866
Because they would have much more,

255
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:37,732
it would be much more difficult for them.

256
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:40,366
So, what we do is just we take them

257
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:41,899
hand by hand and we just

258
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,799
make sure that they are reaching

259
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,999
in those positions.

260
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,332
Okay. So how many cycles has

261
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,299
this program gone through?

262
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,332
And how many women have gone

263
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:53,732
through this program?

264
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:57,166
So, we've already had four cycles.

265
00:14:57,167 --> 00:15:00,832
And more than 160 mentees.

266
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,399
Wonderful. 160 mentees.

267
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,299
That's a lot of data. Am a data guy.

268
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,132
I love looking at data.

269
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:10,232
And extrapolating to some of the

270
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:11,666
bigger picture of questions.

271
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:14,066
And what have you learned over these

272
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:17,299
160 mentees? All extraordinary women

273
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,132
to begin with. I'm sure some of them

274
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:20,432
went on to already become

275
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:21,932
C-Level executives. Some of them

276
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:23,432
are on their way. Some of them

277
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:25,299
perhaps have realized that

278
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,632
they don’t actually want to.

279
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:29,466
Or maybe they are not fit for that.

280
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:30,999
I'm sure that's a possibility too.

281
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,399
What earned secrets have you learn

282
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,799
as the founder of this,

283
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,666
looking at these 160 women?

284
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:42,966
So, I think that I've learned that

285
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:46,366
how important it is to have a community.

286
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:49,799
That supports you. So, some of them

287
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,666
are coming from different backgrounds.

288
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:56,066
And different ethnicities, right.

289
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:57,832
So, some of them are Haredi

290
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,532
and some of them are non.

291
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:01,432
And some of them different

292
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:03,332
communities in Israel.

293
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,199
You have parading them in the program?

294
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,399
Yeah. We do.

295
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,899
Really. Wow. Okay.

296
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,732
Which is amazing. Yup.

297
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:12,866
And you know, arm and hammer,

298
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:14,932
like different communities.

299
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,999
And not all of them are coming

300
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,499
from a background that really

301
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,166
supports them and pushes them.

302
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:30,399
So, I feel like having this community.

303
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,199
I'm talking about the mentees themselves.

304
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,232
Not the mentors.

305
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:37,199
So, having this community

306
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,266
of women that help each other,

307
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:41,166
and open doors for each other.

308
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,166
This is something amazing.

309
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:46,066
I've heard one of our [--].

310
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:47,799
So, she told me like, she called,

311
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,966
I gave her a number of one of our

312
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,466
alumni from the first cycle.

313
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:55,399
And I didn’t tell her that

314
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,599
I'm giving her number.

315
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,032
So, she called and the other person

316
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:02,532
on the line. So, she was like,

317
00:17:02,533 --> 00:16:53,466
"Are you want to be an alumni?

318
00:16:53,467 --> 00:17:05,732
Okay. I will help you. I will do

319
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,466
whatever you need. I will help you

320
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:10,332
in whatever I can."

321
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,832
So, they are really helping each other.

322
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,232
And I think that's a gift.

323
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:16,866
Oh. That one's incredible.

324
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:19,766
Yeah. I think about this question a lot

325
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:22,066
as the chicken and the egg sort of.

326
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:25,866
Where you expect on one hand.

327
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:27,832
I'm looking now on the cyberspace

328
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,432
in 8200 where even though the unit

329
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,199
as a whole has an equal ratio of

330
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,566
male to females. In the cyberspace,

331
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,999
I think it's more like 9:1 male to female.

332
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,132
Which is also, there are a lot of programs

333
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,132
trying to help make that transition

334
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:43,166
more to equality.

335
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,199
But what I were thinking about,

336
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,732
and I had a third of my team

337
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,632
where females. So, we're actually

338
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:51,399
broke the law that for the rest of them

339
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:51,866
and was very proud of.

340
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:53,732
And I kept thinking that,

341
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:56,899
like "Wow". I can imagine the struggle

342
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,932
of even when you get a fantastic

343
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:01,832
woman engineer or analyst

344
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,032
or whatever to come in.

345
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:04,632
She has to go. And I'll sit in a room,

346
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:06,999
with seven, eight other guys

347
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,399
with very few representation

348
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,832
of other women.

349
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,432
That's very intimidating and

350
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:13,199
I'm thinking back to high school.

351
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,899
Where you have CS classrooms

352
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,732
filled with men.

353
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:19,299
That's intimidating to go and

354
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,566
be the one out.

355
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,832
And I'm almost wondering

356
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,599
how do we break the cycle

357
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,932
where we stop this intimidation

358
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:26,832
and we just level the plain field.

359
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,899
Very good question.

360
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,932
So, I think of that, what we do is

361
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:34,966
we work with companies in Israel.

362
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:36,766
So, exactly as you said.

363
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:39,466
Being the only woman at the room

364
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:43,166
is very difficult. It's very hard.

365
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:45,299
So, were working with companies

366
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,999
in order to have them change

367
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,832
the way that they are thinking about.

368
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,132
Even according women.

369
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:54,632
We're talking to managers

370
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,299
that are men about the differences

371
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,332
and they are working and

372
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,699
how they are performing the interviews.

373
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,966
And then, like even the sitting.

374
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:06,032
And what happens when

375
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:10,399
a woman is pregnant? So, sometimes

376
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,399
she needs to have a parking space

377
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,999
sometimes. And sometimes,

378
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,132
there are different things

379
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:22,299
that a woman needs or that would

380
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,832
help her achieve her potential, right?

381
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:31,366
So, were really working with companies.

382
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:34,399
In order to help them create an

383
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,199
environment that enables women

384
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,532
to get to the high-level positions.

385
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:40,799
Wonderful.

386
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,932
Keren, we have just about

387
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:43,099
five minutes left. And I’d love

388
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,766
to use this time to learn a little bit

389
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,566
more about you. So, tell me

390
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:47,732
where do you come from?

391
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,299
You did 8200. You founded this

392
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,099
incredible organization that is now

393
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,466
continuing to do great things.

394
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:54,299
But you're also working full time

395
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,832
in the industry. So, tell me a little bit

396
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:57,632
about what interest you?

397
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:58,332
And what excites you?

398
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:03,766
So, I'm really excited about

399
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:08,532
changing things that I don’t really

400
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:13,099
agree with. So, it also relates to women.

401
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,699
And to deal with woman equality

402
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,632
and to other communities in Israel

403
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:20,832
that are currently not having the same

404
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:24,166
representation as they should have.

405
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:27,366
In the industry. So that's something

406
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29,866
that really excites me. And I really,

407
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:31,932
so I'm working in the finance industry.

408
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,566
In the cybersecurity in Australia.

409
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,866
A finance position. I really love that.

410
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:40,799
I really like the combination

411
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,999
of thinking about the next product

412
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,866
and how you go to the market

413
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:50,732
and how to get money out of that.

414
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:55,699
So, I really like that. I think that's it.

415
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,232
So, tell me a little bit about

416
00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:00,466
how do you balance these things?

417
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,232
So, you're running this organization

418
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:04,432
that takes a lot of time to work on.

419
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:05,932
It's a lot of relationship building.

420
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,766
A lot of meetings and effort.

421
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,332
I know from organizing

422
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,532
a hackathon event, which are

423
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:13,899
one-time events that facilitates

424
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,866
these relationships.

425
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:15,966
That takes a lot of effort.

426
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:17,032
At the same time, you're working

427
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:19,399
full time at a company.

428
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,766
And you're also probably working

429
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:21,966
on other stuff that you're excited about.

430
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:22,899
How do you balance everything?

431
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,999
So, I think that I found a way

432
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,832
that also, like when I'm coming

433
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:36,266
to project, I really understand

434
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:39,232
what it takes. Like how many hours

435
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:40,632
I'm going to spend on that.

436
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,432
I don’t have weekends.

437
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:44,699
I have a wonderful husband.

438
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,499
And amazing friends and family.

439
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,099
They are very supportive.

440
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,466
And that's something that really helps.

441
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:56,132
And I also think that once you do

442
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:57,632
something that you really love

443
00:21:57,633 --> 00:22:03,399
and you care about. And so, your life,

444
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,932
everything is sort in a better way.

445
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:07,766
Everything is okay.

446
00:22:07,767 --> 00:22:09,499
So, if I asked you how many hours

447
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,432
a week do you work? Because

448
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:14,366
you know, full time jobs takes 40 hours.

449
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:15,599
But you're actually saying that,

450
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,432
"I don’t work for 40 hours."

451
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:19,566
Technically, I work for much more

452
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:20,766
but I don't consider that as work.

453
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:23,699
Right. Right. Correct.

454
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,499
So, usually I do 30 hours of

455
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,999
volunteering a week.

456
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,766
And I work 50 hours or more of work.

457
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:36,866
How do you balance 30 hours?

458
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:37,932
Like I don’t sleep much.

459
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:40,232
Where do you volunteer?

460
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,032
What is your volunteer work?

461
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:45,399
So, woman2woman takes a lot of time.

462
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,199
We're now 12 women at the team.

463
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,266
Which is amazing.

464
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,832
But it still takes a lot of time.

465
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:51,932
Is everybody volunteer?

466
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:56,666
We have someone that is helping us

467
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:59,399
and get full time job.

468
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,299
But all the others are volunteering.

469
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,299
And yeah. I do a lot of stuff

470
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,532
that I really believe in.

471
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:09,499
That's wonderful. How do you

472
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,666
from the sidelines make sure that

473
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:14,032
the quality remains as when you

474
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:16,099
just started out? Because it's a very

475
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,366
emotional, personal project.

476
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:19,732
And I'm sure that you know sometimes

477
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,866
there are decisions being made that

478
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:22,932
you're not entirely happy with.

479
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:24,799
Or that you don’t feel are the best.

480
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,799
How do you balance now that you are

481
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,632
also working on other stuff?

482
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:31,666
Very good question. When I'll know

483
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:33,132
the answer Ill get back to you.

484
00:23:33,133 --> 00:23:33,799
Wonderful

485
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:40,399
So, it's hard. I tried to do compromises

486
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,799
when I feel that I can do that.

487
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,699
And keep the quality in the

488
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,099
highest level in places where I feel

489
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,799
we can compromise on.

490
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,166
So, just balancing between our

491
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:58,232
activities and things that we are doing

492
00:23:58,233 --> 00:24:02,299
in order to maintain the brand.

493
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,232
And the amazing women that are

494
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:07,299
coming to our program.

495
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,999
Okay. That's wonderful. Keren,

496
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,932
we are almost done. But I'd love to

497
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:12,132
ask you my favorite question.

498
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:14,266
The three words that best

499
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:16,999
describe yourself. Or three words that

500
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,232
one of 160 women who went through this

501
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:21,499
wonderful program would describe you as.

502
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:28,166
So, I think the three words

503
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:31,766
to describe the program and

504
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:35,232
what we're trying to do is like

505
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:39,332
Create, Change, and Impact.

506
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,332
I love it. Keren,

507
