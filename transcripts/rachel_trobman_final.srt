1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,840
So, to help a patient see progress,

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,280
you have to ask questions about things

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,120
just outside of pain score,

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,440
and you have to make them both

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,120
specific enough and general enough

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,720
that the patient

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,320
can see progress throughout.

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,320
Rachel Trobman, thank you so much

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,320
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,680
Welcome.

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,080
Hi. Thank you so much

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,880
for having me, Michael.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,760
Of course. Where in the world

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,280
are you right now?

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,080
I am in New Jersey.

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,400
South Orange, New Jersey,

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,240
which is not too far

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,520
from the city of New York.

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,480
That's an interesting name,

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,160
South Orange.

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,680
I like that.

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,424
Yeah. It's like it feels like a.

23
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:09,359
Go ahead.

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,560
Exactly.

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,000
But, that's exactly what it feels like.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,240
But what I really

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,520
want to start talking about

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
is your fun fact.

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,080
You're in Peru, how do you get

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,960
to sew somebody's arm back

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,120
without even being a doctor?

32
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,240
Even if you were a doctor,

33
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,840
it sounds crazy.

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,720
What happened over there?

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,920
So, when I was in college,

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,760
I spent the summer living

37
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,120
in Urubamba Peru,

38
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,360
which is like a small town

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,800
in the Sacred Valley.

40
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,080
I was working for an NGO

41
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,920
and they put me,

42
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,760
because I was interested

43
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,400
in medicine and science

44
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,720
and a working at a hospital.

45
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,480
I didn't speak any Spanish at the time.

46
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,120
I spoke fluent French.

47
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,720
And the doctor that I was working with

48
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,600
didn't speak any English.

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,880
So, I would ask him questions in French

50
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,320
and he would respond in Spanish.

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,240
And that's how we got by.

52
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,320
And mostly what I was doing

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,200
was like doing patient intake,

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,280
taking notes,

55
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,920
kind of like setting

56
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,000
and doing triage for the doctor.

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,320
But one day he was,

58
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,160
I forget what he was doing.

59
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,800
He was like catering to another patient.

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,160
And this patient came in

61
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,640
having accidentally chopped his arm off

62
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,160
on his birthday.

63
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,280
And they needed somebody to, like,

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,840
start doing the sutures right away.

65
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,560
And the doctor was like,

66
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,240
"You could get started."

67
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
And I was like, "What do you mean

68
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,640
I could get started?"

69
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,160
And he was like,

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,080
"Just there's all the tools

71
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,834
that you need are in the room."

72
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:42,919
And so, I was like, "Okay."

73
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm terrified just listening to this.

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,120
I was like, okay,

75
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,800
I guess we're doing this.

76
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,520
And they needed hands.

77
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
And then, of course, he joined me

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,120
and we finished up the job.

79
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,640
But there's nothing quite like

80
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,960
a threat of just, you know,

81
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,360
losing Hanukkah toys.

82
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,160
And so, I,

83
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,080
yeah, so that's what happened.

84
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,400
That's how I did it.

85
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,600
And thankfully,

86
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,320
I didn't have to do it again.

87
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,280
The most important question.

88
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,120
Yes?

89
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,040
Is the man okay?

90
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,600
Is the person okay?

91
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,200
He is totally fine.

92
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,720
Yeah.

93
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,560
I went on to do other x-rays.

94
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,640
I did not go on to become a doctor.

95
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,000
I realized that like emergency room

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,160
trauma was like not my thing.

97
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,640
But it was, yeah,

98
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,360
it was one of those things

99
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,080
where like I guess

100
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,840
you learn on the ground,

101
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,320
but it's not, anywhere else,

102
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,280
that would not be acceptable.

103
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,680
But there, the guy lived totally fine.

104
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,320
And that's the story.

105
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:48,520
Amazing. I love that.

106
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,200
I definitely feel

107
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,440
my heart pumping and terrified

108
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,360
as you're telling that story.

109
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,720
And just imagining myself

110
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,480
in that situation.

111
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,280
And I don't know

112
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,880
if I could have done what you did.

113
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,920
So, that's very impressive.

114
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,440
But, Rachel,

115
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,480
even more impressive

116
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,680
is the, your really unique

117
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,880
and amazing journey that you've had.

118
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,440
Both in the medical side,

119
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,960
but also in journalism

120
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,760
and production and media,

121
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,651
which is where I believe

122
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:12,760
you spent quite a long time in

123
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,040
partially, being a contributing author

124
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,960
to in The New York Times,

125
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,360
of all places, which is incredible.

126
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,560
And now, most recently transitioned

127
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,960
into the role of the CEO

128
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,080
of Upside Health with Ouchie

129
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,320
as one of the products.

130
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,000
So, Rachel, I have to understand

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,040
a little bit about your journey

132
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,520
before we dive into

133
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,840
the digital health markets.

134
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,640
Talk to me about how do you go

135
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,160
across these different industries?

136
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,680
Yeah. Well, I mean, for me,

137
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,080
it really started from,

138
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,600
I was always interested

139
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
in telling people stories

140
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,320
and in journalism and media,

141
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,560
particularly in health journalism.

142
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,400
And I got my first job

143
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,640
at New York One where I was

144
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:56,640
on the digital side of things.

145
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,000
And in the early days

146
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,520
of digital journalism,

147
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,720
it was really just like taking stories

148
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,000
that were made for production,

149
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,600
for TV, and then editing them

150
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,080
into something that would work

151
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,080
somewhat digitally.

152
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:12,760
And everyone assumed

153
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,400
that digital journalists were coders

154
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,320
at that time.

155
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,920
Anyone that was on the web

156
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,240
was considered a coder.

157
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,720
But I was just like,

158
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,760
it was the first job I was able to get.

159
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,880
So, I was a good writer

160
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,840
and was able to do it.

161
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,640
But being in that position

162
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,160
offered me a lot of opportunities

163
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,000
to like, try my hand at shooting,

164
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,920
try my hand at reporting

165
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,440
and try my hand at editing.

166
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,760
And it also gave me a chance to work

167
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,280
with content management systems.

168
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,080
And so, I got pretty good

169
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,360
at what I was doing

170
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,720
and was approached to join

171
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,520
a digital media company as a first hire.

172
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,000
And that was my first foray

173
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,520
into the startup world.

174
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,880
And while there,

175
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:53,960
and I have always been somebody who,

176
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,360
as was attested by

177
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,600
the hand sewing experience,

178
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,000
if there was an opportunity

179
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,720
to learn something

180
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,320
in real time, I'll take it.

181
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,360
I say yes before I say no.

182
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,320
And so, here was an opportunity for me

183
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,920
to immerse myself in something

184
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,040
that I was very confident

185
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,680
that I could execute

186
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,720
but I had never done before.

187
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,800
And then I quickly moved

188
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,800
into business development and strategy,

189
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,960
built the team from

190
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,880
zero to like a billion lifetime views

191
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,680
in just two years.

192
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,400
And this is kind of on the side,

193
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,320
but my husband's a software engineer,

194
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,800
he's a technologist.

195
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:36,760
And in the early days

196
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,320
of iPhone development and apps,

197
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,400
we decided to try our hands at that.

198
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,280
I would do the content

199
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,200
and he'd do the development.

200
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,600
And so, we got really good at it as well.

201
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,360
And it was a skill at that time

202
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,000
that not many people were doing.

203
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,400
So, people started hiring us

204
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,200
to build apps for them.

205
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,160
And so, I left my

206
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,520
content development role

207
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,280
and kind of moved it

208
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,960
into this new space

209
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,920
and started building for

210
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,400
you know, Fortune 500 companies,

211
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,000
startups,

212
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,880
really leading product strategy,

213
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,920
knowing that like being

214
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,240
a good storyteller

215
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,840
could transform based off the platform.

216
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,360
And so, if you know

217
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,400
how to tell a good story

218
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,680
and make something compelling

219
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,120
that people want to use

220
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,800
or want to read

221
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,120
or want to experience,

222
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,440
you can transfer that skill.

223
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,680
And so, when we got confident enough

224
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,640
that we could build something

225
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,080
from ideation to execution seamlessly,

226
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,480
I decided we were ready

227
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,720
to turn our attention

228
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,680
to something more personal.

229
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,040
Which kind of brings us to Upside Health.

230
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,120
When I was 17, I was diagnosed

231
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,600
with the connective tissue disease.

232
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,960
That was incredibly painful.

233
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,120
But I was a unique,

234
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,560
albeit unfortunate advantage

235
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,080
and that my mom has lupus

236
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,360
and my brother has cystic fibrosis.

237
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,160
So, I grew up in environments

238
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,800
where managing complex

239
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,000
chronic health conditions was the norm.

240
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,120
Having a built in supportive environment

241
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,680
was always there.

242
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,880
And yet, even with all of these things,

243
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,320
I found that pain was a tripping point.

244
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,080
Right?

245
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:25,640
There is no seamless easy way

246
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,960
to manage pain

247
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,360
because pain, unlike some

248
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,440
of the other metrics

249
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,560
that are being managed,

250
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,960
are really subjective.

251
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,160
And when a primary symptom

252
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,200
of what you're living with

253
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,960
is something that is really subjective,

254
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,280
it becomes hard to communicate around.

255
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,400
It feels hard to get validated.

256
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,400
And it is hard to treat

257
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,960
from just not like the patient perspective,

258
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,840
but also from the clinician perspective.

259
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,280
Something that people don't know,

260
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
maybe not think about

261
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,640
with like a lot of patients

262
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,120
who have chronic diseases,

263
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,920
is they spend a lot of time

264
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,320
with their doctors.

265
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,120
And if you're someone like me

266
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,280
who has a journalistic background,

267
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,680
who likes to ask questions

268
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,040
and hear answers,

269
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,240
you get to know

270
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,480
their pain points really well.

271
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,120
Right.

272
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,400
And understand that, like,

273
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,680
this wasn't just something

274
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,840
I was experiencing

275
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,200
as a patient saying, like,

276
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,720
this is hard to manage

277
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
and I'm frustrated

278
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,040
and I'm isolated,

279
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,760
but also something that

280
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,600
the clinicians would say like

281
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,480
this isn't easy.

282
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,680
It's not easy for me either.

283
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,160
And so, I found that

284
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,360
there was like an opportunity right there

285
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,920
to help facilitate change.

286
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,080
So, how does that actually

287
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,680
so, first of all, give you a little bit

288
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,000
of a broader perspective

289
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,600
into what's available today.

290
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,520
How many people are going through

291
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,240
somewhat of a similar experience

292
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,040
or need help managing that experience,

293
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,760
which led to your understanding

294
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,560
that there is actually,

295
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,040
not just an opportunity

296
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,000
to help some people,

297
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,920
but help a significant number of people

298
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,760
where it can actually be

299
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,480
a viable business

300
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,200
that becomes Upside Health?

301
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,200
Great question.

302
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,560
So, I mean, it's very clear,

303
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,160
I'm not running a nonprofit here

304
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,920
as much as I would love

305
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,880
to be able to help people

306
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,480
just from that.

307
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,240
But like, you have to,

308
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,960
I was interested in building a business

309
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,640
because I saw a substantial problem,

310
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,560
as I said, but also

311
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,240
a really large market opportunity.

312
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,840
I mean, there are 50 million Americans.

313
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,120
Right.

314
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,800
Some people will say

315
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
100 million Americans,

316
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,280
but I'm going conservative

317
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,960
and saying 50 million Americans

318
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,920
who live with chronic pain.

319
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,160
20 million of them.

320
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,120
Yes.

321
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,040
So, that's more than

322
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,800
I think, heart disease

323
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,280
and diabetes combined.

324
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,920
If you add in like 100 million,

325
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,280
that's diabetes, heart disease

326
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,280
and cancer combined.

327
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,960
Looking at the number is enormous.

328
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,680
And 20 million of them

329
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,720
live with debilitating chronic pain.

330
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,480
So, that's the kind of chronic pain

331
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,880
that limits your ability to work,

332
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,080
to socialize,

333
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,400
to conduct functional life tasks.

334
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,040
And so, that population,

335
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,640
though is only being served

336
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,680
by about 4000 pain specialists.

337
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,240
Meaning that there's

338
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,200
less than one pain specialist

339
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,480
for every 10 thousand Americans

340
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,200
who live with chronic pain.

341
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,960
Wow.

342
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,960
So, 95% of chronic pain patients

343
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,720
don't get access to specialized care.

344
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,680
And then even those who do,

345
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,960
those are pain specialists

346
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,560
who we're seeing 40 patients a day

347
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,600
and are being incentivized

348
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,520
for the injections and the procedures

349
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,680
and not necessarily for lengthy visits

350
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,600
that discuss medication history.

351
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,560
Like it's just, it's the way

352
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,680
that the system is set up.

353
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,000
Plus, they're doing their best

354
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,160
to see as many patients

355
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,720
as they can

356
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,760
because there's so few people

357
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,720
to offer this care.

358
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,840
The other challenge with chronic pain

359
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,080
is like, as I mentioned, you know,

360
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:05,440
It is subjective in many ways,

361
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,120
but it's also best served

362
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,720
by multi-modal solutions.

363
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,440
What do you mean by that?

364
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,760
So, when pain is last longer

365
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,800
than like six months,

366
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,680
which is what would be defined

367
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,400
as chronic pain, solutions that cater

368
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,640
to the bio, social, emotional,

369
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,000
like bio-psycho social environment

370
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,080
are the most effective.

371
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,920
Because pain, at that point,

372
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,200
is not just coming

373
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,360
from a physical location,

374
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,520
it's coming from pain signals

375
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,160
that are being sent from the brain.

376
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,360
There is normally a depression

377
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,280
or anxiety component.

378
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,840
There's an isolation component.

379
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,920
There's a movement component.

380
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,240
And so, unless you are providing

381
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,080
a multidisciplinary solution,

382
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,600
you're going to have limited outcomes.

383
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,360
But I mean, what I just explained to you

384
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,760
is not scalable

385
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,960
by most health care providers

386
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,120
or most health systems,

387
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,800
like in a traditional

388
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,000
brick and mortar fashion.

389
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,080
You really need,

390
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,480
this is like an opportunity

391
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,400
that's ripe for digital intervention

392
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,160
because you just can't offer that service

393
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,040
or those services en masse

394
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,120
to people who are already

395
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,960
having difficulty moving, right?

396
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,560
Like, getting a patient

397
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,200
to go to one doctor's visit

398
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,640
is hard enough when they're

399
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,480
in so much pain.

400
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,160
Getting them to go

401
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,880
to three different visits,

402
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,680
remember them,

403
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,880
might get value from them,

404
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,800
have insurance cover them

405
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,920
is just it's really hard.

406
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,960
Right. And I guess,

407
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,120
that's where Upside Health comes in.

408
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,160
So, how are you actually helping,

409
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,680
you know, this incredible market,

410
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,600
that I'm shocked by the magnitude of it

411
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,880
that we're talking about

412
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,240
50 million Americans,

413
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,720
conservative speaking,

414
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,040
that have some sort of chronic pain?

415
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,680
How do you help them?

416
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,440
Well, and the other thing

417
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,120
to note about this

418
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,480
really large market size

419
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,960
is that we're also talking

420
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,200
about incredible amount of spending

421
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
within a health system.

422
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,200
So like, an average chronic pain patient

423
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,640
goes to the doctor 19 times a year.

424
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,920
It costs the health system $34,000.

425
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,680
So, there is more than $600 billion

426
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,760
spent every year in chronic pain cost.

427
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,400
So, I mean, this is not just

428
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,880
like a big market,

429
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,240
but it's a really expensive one

430
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,240
for health systems payers

431
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,800
really across the board.

432
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,920
So, how do we help?

433
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,200
How do we solve this?

434
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,720
It's really about providing

435
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,760
a multifaceted solution

436
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,280
that providers can easily distribute

437
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,920
to their patients that allows

438
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,440
for not just behavior change

439
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,600
on the point of the patient,

440
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,200
but that behavior change

441
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,840
creates a reduction in clinical burden.

442
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,440
It also creates a decreased cost

443
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,560
for a system

444
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,160
and then incentivizes providers

445
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,240
through it being reimbursable.

446
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,920
The software is mobile software

447
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,840
that uses the best

448
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,680
of patient reported data.

449
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,120
So, everything on mood,

450
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,280
sleep, functional ability

451
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,760
and then passively collected

452
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,680
physiologic data

453
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,000
to help the patient better understand

454
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
what's happening with their pain.

455
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,280
We help them set goals

456
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,960
towards treatment like what would be,

457
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,240
if their pain were 50%

458
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,160
less, for instance,

459
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,440
what they would do differently.

460
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,000
And then based off of this information

461
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,280
that they provide and that we gather,

462
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,960
we connect them

463
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,920
to a curated cohort of other patients,

464
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,840
to ensure that nobody hurts alone.

465
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,720
We also direct them

466
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,160
to integrative wellness content.

467
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,480
So, something that responds

468
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,760
to their particular needs

469
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,120
at a particular time.

470
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,720
So, let's say the patient is

471
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,840
reporting that they are

472
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,400
having difficulty sleeping

473
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,280
or sleeping under six hours a night,

474
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,800
that sleep is restless.

475
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,120
We know from their physiologic data

476
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,920
that we've gathered

477
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,680
that they have been rather sedentary.

478
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,280
And their goal is

479
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,360
to be able to go grocery shopping

480
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,480
so they can have

481
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,000
some nutritious meals in their house.

482
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,160
The content that we provide

483
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,480
maybe in at meditation's,

484
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,360
exercises, stretches,

485
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,840
information about like sleep hygiene,

486
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,520
interactive content around

487
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,240
preparing a grocery shopping list,

488
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,440
for instance,

489
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,560
and then support from other patients

490
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,440
and our health coaches

491
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,680
to help them reach those goals.

492
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,640
And then the clinicians,

493
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,520
on the other hand,

494
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,280
get to view this high level data.

495
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,040
We synthesize the data,

496
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,800
we review it with our clinical team,

497
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,120
and then we offer them everything

498
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,280
that's required to build,

499
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,160
so, that way they don't have

500
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,960
to take that on internally.

501
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,000
Interesting.

502
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,240
So, walk me through the process.

503
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,560
If I have, let's say

504
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,800
I have chronic back pain, right,

505
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,240
and I'm looking for that support.

506
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,320
What is my interaction

507
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,640
with this app on a daily basis?

508
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,280
As well as, how does

509
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,680
this connect to the triangle

510
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,480
where the patient,

511
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,760
the physician and the app?

512
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,400
How does that happen?

513
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,800
Yeah. So, you I mean,

514
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
you could find the app for free

515
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,120
on the app stores.

516
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,160
But really our primary

517
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,320
distribution model now

518
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,600
is through your provider.

519
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,960
So, you were going

520
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,440
to either your a pain specialist,

521
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,680
your primary care provider,

522
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,840
your neurologist, your orthopedist,

523
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,960
and they're saying

524
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,960
we're now using this.

525
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,560
We think that is

526
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,520
medically beneficial and necessary

527
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,320
for you to be part

528
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,720
of this remote patient monitoring

529
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,360
and behavioral health platform, Ouchie.

530
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,000
Here's how you download it.

531
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,840
Somebody from their team

532
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,800
will also reach out

533
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,480
to help on board you.

534
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,920
You'll create an account

535
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,560
where you enter some basic information

536
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,120
and then we'll start pulling

537
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,840
the data right away.

538
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,680
And then based off

539
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,040
of the data that we're pulling,

540
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,480
we'll send your prompts and reminders

541
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,600
about changes in your activity

542
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,920
to say, like, okay,

543
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,560
we've seen these changes,

544
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,880
how do you now respond

545
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,280
to these various

546
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,200
patient reported information.

547
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,000
And here is some content

548
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,320
and community that we think

549
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,360
that will support you.

550
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,160
Now, you're like for four days of trying

551
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,200
this non opioid based treatment,

552
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,320
away from like earning a prize.

553
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,880
And then me,

554
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,840
the doctor who has introduced this to you,

555
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,040
can look in real time and see this.

556
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,240
Or, I could see the monthly reports

557
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,800
at the end of each calendar month

558
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,240
that I received from the Ouchie team

559
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,720
that will give me the insights

560
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,040
in how you've been engaging,

561
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,960
what activities you've tried,

562
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,880
what successes you've had,

563
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,560
how your medication use has changed,

564
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,800
what are the correlations

565
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,480
between this and that.

566
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,560
And then the doctor has

567
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,720
the ability to act on that,

568
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,560
but also to be able

569
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,120
to bill insurance for that.

570
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,520
Right. And it sounds like there's

571
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
a lot of things that

572
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,440
this is helpful with.

573
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,680
First, that it allows

574
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,040
the distribution of access, right?

575
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,440
So, you can have some pain specialists

576
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,520
that are now looking at

577
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,160
and supporting multiple

578
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,040
greater factor of patients

579
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,280
because they're not necessarily looking

580
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,920
and spending an hour

581
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,800
on which they are looking

582
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,560
at higher level data.

583
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,040
You can obviously synthesize the data

584
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,880
and then come up with some

585
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,040
interesting conclusions.

586
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,600
I'm curious about

587
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,040
the user experience side of things.

588
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,840
Because one of the things

589
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,000
that you're mentioning

590
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,440
with habit formation and goal setting,

591
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,000
which is something

592
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,360
that many apps try to do, right?

593
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,040
The notorious to-do list

594
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
app that you can write

595
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,760
a million to dos,

596
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,560
and never follow through with them.

597
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
So, talk to me a little bit

598
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,600
about goal setting

599
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,000
and habit formation

600
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,440
in the context of chronic pain,

601
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,760
and how you're

602
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,200
tackling that through user experience.

603
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:06,200
So, one of the problems

604
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,080
with the way that we've gathered

605
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,480
and measured pain in the past

606
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,880
is it's like solely dependent

607
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,040
on the pain score.

608
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,640
And so, it's really hard to see progress

609
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,160
if like every time you're asked

610
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,600
what your pain level is,

611
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,920
it's a level eight.

612
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,560
And there's so many reasons

613
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,600
why a patient will give level eight.

614
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,240
Maybe they really

615
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,000
are in excruciating pain.

616
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,400
Maybe the doctor

617
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,360
won't take them seriously

618
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,880
if they say six.

619
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,680
Maybe they,

620
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,080
I mean, there's just a lot.

621
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,520
So, pain score,

622
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,720
a lot of times doesn't vary.

623
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,480
And so, to help a patient see progress,

624
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,240
you have to ask questions

625
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,760
about things just outside of pain score.

626
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,320
And you have to

627
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,400
make them both specific enough

628
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,320
and general enough that the patient

629
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,360
can see progress throughout.

630
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,040
So, we tie progress

631
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,440
to small functional tasks,

632
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,440
but based off of

633
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,840
what the patient is changing

634
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,720
in their pain score

635
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,120
or their mood in their sleep,

636
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,040
we'll rearrange them

637
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,240
in a different order.

638
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,200
So, that way the patient can see progress.

639
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,920
And the progress will change

640
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:20,600
based off of various other scores.

641
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,880
And also, there's some things

642
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,160
that we ask in terms of smart goals.

643
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,760
You know, if you're paying

644
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,800
there's also the way

645
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,320
that you ask a question, right?

646
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,600
If you're paying were 50% less,

647
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,080
what would you do differently.

648
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,200
We're not asking patients

649
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,320
to complete tasks

650
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,280
for the sake of completing tasks.

651
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,120
We're giving them

652
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,080
tasks that are part of their regular life

653
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,680
and asking them

654
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,240
how close they are to completing it.

655
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,280
And then we reward them for things

656
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,120
that they might not realize

657
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,320
that are our accomplishments.

658
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,720
But sticking with something,

659
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,520
for instance,

660
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,080
it's almost like the surprise of

661
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,760
you've been hanging in there.

662
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,560
That's a reward, cheering on other users.

663
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,440
And then through time,

664
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,920
those things become a habit.

665
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,720
Every time our users update,

666
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,520
they have an option

667
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,320
to either post privately

668
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,080
just for themselves

669
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,640
or their provider, or publicly,

670
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,600
to the Ouchie community.

671
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
And what we see

672
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,240
is a lot of users start posting privately

673
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,320
but are still engaging

674
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
in the cheer and support of others.

675
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,040
And then over time,

676
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,920
they transition into being part of

677
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,080
the community in a more complete way.

678
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,800
So, we aren't forcing the users

679
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,480
to do anything

680
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,600
that they're not doing,

681
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,200
but bit by bit like introducing

682
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,280
behavior change techniques.

683
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,680
I think the other thing that,

684
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,680
you know, is missed a lot of time

685
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,960
with just like forcing

686
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,640
a program onto somebody

687
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,080
is not meeting them

688
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,200
where they're already at.

689
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,680
So, with chronic pain patients,

690
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,640
a lot of these patients

691
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,760
have been dismissed.

692
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,600
A lot of these patients

693
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,240
have had to go to a lot

694
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,680
of different providers before

695
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,120
they find one that is specialized.

696
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,160
As I mentioned, there's not a lot

697
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,480
of specialized providers.

698
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,560
So, a lot of patients

699
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,160
are still being seen

700
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,440
by their primary care doctor

701
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,880
who doesn't have enough time.

702
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,920
And so, creating an immediate contact

703
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,520
with the patient of acknowledgment

704
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,400
and recognition and say,

705
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,240
okay, we see that

706
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,040
these are the problems

707
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,360
that you're having right now,

708
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,560
here are some solutions

709
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,800
right on this platform

710
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,720
that can help you with that

711
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,600
and then we'll introduce something

712
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,880
maybe that you haven't thought of.

713
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,040
But until you can address some

714
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,600
of their immediate need,

715
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,120
it's really hard to gain the patient's

716
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,760
trust that, like,

717
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,040
we're really on their team.

718
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,280
We're not just trying to like,

719
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,320
force something upon them

720
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,680
that the doctor once.

721
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,720
I don't know if that makes sense.

722
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,440
And then we have to build

723
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,360
that trust on a clinical side as well.

724
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,360
Then we have to build this trust

725
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,480
on the clinical side as well that like

726
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,480
we're not trying to create

727
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,680
more work for them,

728
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,840
that we know

729
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,680
how challenging our jobs. We are like,

730
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,280
we have to build

731
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,440
not like a marketplace,

732
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,680
but you do have

733
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,000
two different types of clients

734
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,320
that you're trying to support.

735
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,640
100%. And it makes perfect sense

736
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,440
that the complexity is there,

737
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,840
the importance of it is there

738
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,680
the you know,

739
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,280
the sensitivity is there.

740
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,800
Because I think,

741
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,080
one of the interesting complexities

742
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,040
that you're introducing here,

743
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
the layer of the user experience

744
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,400
of trying to identify the pain

745
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,840
and measure something

746
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,880
that is qualitative not quantitative,

747
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,120
but you're trying to do it

748
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,360
in a way that is aligning incentives.

749
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,640
Because at the end,

750
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,400
your incentive is to gauge the real pain

751
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,560
so that you can help them form

752
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,000
their habits and pass that information

753
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,520
to the physician.

754
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,560
Their incentive is to get better.

755
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,680
And there is sort of this misalignment

756
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,840
in the industry right now

757
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,240
where if you don't,

758
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,800
if sometimes you're not

759
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,120
you know, dramatic enough

760
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,560
or exuberant enough about it,

761
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,800
then perhaps people are not going

762
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,400
to take you seriously enough.

763
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,960
Especially I'm guessing,

764
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,320
in an industry where you're saying

765
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,160
that there's 95% people

766
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,400
that don't have the care

767
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,920
that they need to have.

768
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,040
So, it sounds like what you're doing

769
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,040
here is hugely, hugely important.

770
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,480
I do have to apologize

771
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,200
that I should have called

772
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,640
this show 30 minute leaders

773
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,280
are not 20 Minute Leaders.

774
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,120
But Rachel, this has been fascinating.

775
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,040
And I want to thank you for being

776
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,360
generous with your time.

777
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,160
My last question is,

778
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,000
the most important one,

779
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,120
which is the three words

780
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,760
that you would use to describe yourself.

781
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,480
Tenacious.

782
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,760
Passionate.

783
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:46,160
And compassionate almost to a fault.

784
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,880
I like that. I like that.

785
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,080
And I'm sure that you have

786
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,240
to have those things in order

787
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,840
to do what you're doing there.

788
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,800
And I wish we could talk more about it,

789
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,360
about the journey

790
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,960
and the transition from journalism

791
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,840
and production and media to this.

792
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,920
But this is all wonderful.

793
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,920
Rachel, thank you for helping

794
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,280
improve people's lives.

795
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,920
I love businesses that are taking

796
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,320
people that need help,

797
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,920
finding a good business solution

798
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,760
that is a win-win situation.

799
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,520
I truly believe that in order to make

800
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
a real impact, there has

801
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,800
to be aligned incentives.

802
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,600
People don't work for free.

803
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,120
In order to have

804
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,280
the best people with you,

805
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,760
it needs to be a viable business.

806
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,560
And that's why I am

807
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,880
unapologetically saying

808
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,840
we're not a non-profit,

809
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,960
we're a for profit business,

810
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,440
but we're helping improve people's lives.

811
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,000
And that's a win win situation

812
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,280
that is beautiful.

813
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,800
So, thank you for doing that.

814
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,720
And stay safe and stay healthy.

815
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,080
Thank you.

816
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,400
Thank you so much for having me.

817
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,560
And you stay well as well.
