00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,440
Yaron Carni
thank you so much for joining me on

2
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,560
20 minute leaders

3
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,200
my pleasure
thank you for having me

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,000
you're calling from Israel, right?
I am

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,080
how is everything over there?

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,520
things are starting to get back to some
form of normalization starting this week

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,080
but it's way too early to assess

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,360
I myself am still at home
yeah, you will

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,240
You know, this is going to be
broadcasted in just a few weeks

10
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,920
so hopefully by then we'll keep

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,760
on the optimism and and they're starting
to open up or we fully opened up

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,000
but we'll see
and let me doubt it

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,920
but let's see
We'll see, we'll see

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,520
OK, Yaron, such a great pleasure
thank you so much

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,240
founder of Maverick Partners

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,040
you're on the board of of some incredible
organizations that we'll touch upon

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,880
A contributor at Forbes

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,660
I've been falling for a long time in a big fan,

19
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,320
and I'd love to spend these 20
minutes to sort of pick your brain

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,140
and have a discussion on what it's like to
open up a venture capital firm

21
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,080
in a pretty non-traditional way like
you did while at the same time really

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,160
being a core part of these
organizations and companies

23
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,280
so maybe, give me a quick rundown of what

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:35,800
happened in your life that led to Maverick
and then joining these awesome companies

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,160
so OK, so that goes back to my schooling
I wouldn't know school specifically

26
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,440
yeah,
I studied

27
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,440
I grew up in the States
for a bunch of years

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,440
I'm Israeli born, grew up in the States

29
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,760
and then moved back to Israel to finish
high school, do the army and all that

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:00,760
and then I started studying here
in Israel at the IDC at the Zell program

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,000
I was in the second Zell Program class
wow

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,080
and I just did a talk with Liat Aaronson

33
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,400
I don't know if she was
the director back then

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,680
she wasn't

35
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,880
she wasn't born then

36
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,240
when I, when I was a student

37
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,240
and she's terrific,
she's a force behind the program,

38
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,480
definitely last many, many years,
over a decade, of course, anyhow

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,360
so I study there and I was always

40
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,880
an entrepreneur,
from a very young age myself, really

41
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,600
dabbling in every kind of different
feel that you could imagine

42
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,000
I was always

43
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,240
attracted to setting up companies
and setting up businesses and sailing

44
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,600
I sailed a lack with a lot of different,
different ideas

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,040
and a bit after the my first degree,

46
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,960
my bachelor degree, I flew back to New
York and I worked there with my brother

47
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,920
he had a promotional staffing agency like
H.R. Platform at the Times are independent

48
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,200
contractors that he had founded,
called G.C. Marketing

49
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,680
and I went back and helped
him with the company

50
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,800
and about a year later, we found

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,680
a buyer who we sold the majority
holdings to the company to

52
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,240
and I decided to come home
back home to Israel and

53
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,000
I came back and I was
looking for what to do

54
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,760
and then

55
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,240
I was, actually I started my master's
degree in IP law

56
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,040
and I decided that I would be
very attracted to the whole field

57
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,440
of technologies

58
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,880
was that really a first interception

59
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,960
with technology when you
did your masters in IP

60
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,400
is that when you really got into it

61
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,560
I think during the Zell program,

62
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,080
I was most exposed to it
and I'm actually goes back

63
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,200
the story connects and you're even
connected to it, to this story indirectly,

64
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,440
you yourself

65
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:02,480
and then I, I decided, I teamed up
with with a friend from New York who is

66
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,280
a very successful businessperson
who I met actually also my studies

67
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,840
and he had sold his company in the States

68
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,280
and he said, you know what, let's start

69
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,560
I keep hearing about Israeli innovation

70
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,840
let's start an angel group together

71
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,920
in which we will invest in very
early stage Israeli companies

72
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,360
so I was, it was basically, you know,

73
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,480
everyone had that moment in their life,
yet completely changed their life

74
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,920
that was my moment
wow

75
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,000
I mean, to this day,
it's probably my moment

76
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,840
and I remember that call and I said,
all right, great

77
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,880
and I started looking
for startups to invest in

78
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,640
and I was you know, I was
looking for things for quite a long time

79
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,840
and I couldn't find anything
that I really like

80
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,880
and so I this I thought at the time that,

81
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,560
you know, basically I'm screwed in a way
where this is just too difficult to do

82
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,000
and then out of nowhere,
I was very, very lucky to have

83
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,600
to have been X to have remained

84
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,040
my classmate from the Zell
program of dead contact

85
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,840
he had set up a company with

86
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,760
four other founders that was called
Lappe Pixie's yeah I Pixie's data widgets

87
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,000
for I Google, I Google is the
equivalent of say the App Store nowadays

88
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,120
but this was prehistoric
on such a long time ago

89
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,600
I remember it from my childhood
exactly

90
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,080
and that company I remember it launched

91
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,080
in the first first day
and made five dollars

92
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,240
wow
this is an amazing company

93
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,480
because there's so much potential

94
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,680
and we, I ended up convincing my partner

95
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,520
to invest and he thought it was you know,
he didn't really connect to it as much

96
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,240
and we thought a million
dollars in the company

97
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,840
I'd put a hundred thousand dollars
in the company, which was all I had

98
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,680
and, you know, it was
all the money saved up

99
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,240
and you know long journey

100
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,560
I also became the the head
of this debt at the company

101
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,520
so I was both in the investment
proactively, actively involved

102
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,320
we also also invested in six other six

103
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,680
companies in total
and that company larynxes

104
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,840
and they'd be ended up being the first
Israeli company to be sold to Google

105
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,320
wow

106
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,880
the Google guy

107
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,440
and

108
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,600
he was based in the States at the time

109
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,280
and we started talking

110
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,000
that led to a relationship
that was really amazing

111
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,080
and then the deal was done very quickly

112
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,000
and it was really a true pleasure
to work with Google in this process

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,760
and then at the time made me quite known

114
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,720
in the market and I got a lot
of deal flow off the site

115
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,160
right

116
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,200
as I mentioned earlier,
we had invested in six companies

117
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,480
yeah, well, two of them folded

118
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,600
and for them, we were able to sell
wow

119
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,240
that's considered a very

120
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,520
lucky track record
yeah, of course

121
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,600
and, but I love that

122
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,560
I love being able to find entrepreneurs
at a very early stage

123
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,600
I love being able to help them,
you know, with everything and anything

124
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,480
you can imagine really being one
of them as a founder in a way

125
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,480
so it's some of the companies, you know,

126
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,440
buyers don't touch,
of course, to this every day

127
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,760
but some of them, you know, we have all
the growing pains that they had suffered

128
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,760
we aren't sure with them

129
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,760
how tight was your

130
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,280
relationship with your with your
founders and your first investments?

131
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,560
because, you know, now that it's all over

132
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,600
the spectrum, some some investors
like to be very hands on

133
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,520
some of them are very, you know,
talk to me every quarter

134
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,760
well, what was
extremely I mean, daily, almost daily

135
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,240
oh wow

136
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,000
yeah at least several times a week

137
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,320
nowadays

138
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,480
by the way, we're still
very actively involved

139
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,080
that's a fund also

140
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,080
almost the same level of intensity because

141
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,840
we believe that that's
what we can provide

142
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,120
apart from money, you know,
it's the added value component

143
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,280
but what I learned in that in that angel

144
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,600
group, which is called
the Tel Aviv Angel Group

145
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,120
Yep
Is the importance of working with your

146
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:15,640
investors and getting as much added value
from them as possible because everybody

147
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,960
has the ability to be helpful
to the companies they just need

148
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,560
to be helpful
totally

149
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,760
and that's the point total,

150
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,400
and you need to know how to motivate them
and how to get their attention and all

151
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,120
these people, even though likely
this won't change their lifestyles

152
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,800
the company does it, right well,

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,080
they still want to be helpful

154
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,320
and they find the companies
interesting both

155
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,880
and then they come nudnik perspective,

156
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,760
but also, you know, challenging
in other forms an adult's interest

157
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,520
they like to be helpful to the companies
based on what they're doing

158
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,880
interesting
right

159
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,400
so what is that?
what is maverick actually?

160
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,440
What what does that name stands for?
Maverick

161
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,760
Maverick actually sort of is the next

162
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,280
generation step of of them have the
Tel Aviv Angel group that I've founded

163
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,440
and the word maverick was chosen
because of the dual meaning

164
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,880
we all know what a maverick means
in English, but in Hebrew maverick

165
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,120
it's not sleek
that's art to shine, to be

166
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,640
a genius idea

167
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,800
and that's what that's the
origin of this name

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,840
so we're Maverick Ventures, Israel

169
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,160
that's the name of the fund

170
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,840
we have two funds

171
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,000
our first fund was just a bit
over 40 million dollars

172
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,640
the second fund was over
75 million dollars

173
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,000
wow

174
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,160
and now we are in the process of
fundraising for our search fund

175
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,720
wonderful

176
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,480
so how many companies
have invested in so far?

177
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,640
we've invested in 35 companies I believe
wow

178
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,560
last year was very, very active

179
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,640
I think we were one
of the most active funds

180
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:55,000
it's not the in Israel, but we don't tend
to promote any of the deals that we do

181
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,760
I'm not against it if other firms do

182
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,520
but we ourselves or the company does

183
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,920
we ourselves

184
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,000
relatively shy away from proactive
public relations at this time

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,880
until, God willing, we
succeed in one of the companies

186
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,720
something interesting happens
with the companies and we're very happy

187
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,120
our approach is to try to be relatively
modest and we can at this stage

188
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,680
so give me maybe, you know,
two or two or three very quick

189
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,000
intuitions that you're looking for as

190
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,200
as you're approaching
due diligence about it

191
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,200
I'm assuming this is more
seed stage right for now

192
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,840
we do early growth,

193
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,640
our cheque size is usually
up to five million dollars

194
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,040
wow, ok,
two to five million dollars

195
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,520
is our

196
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,040
so I no longer do the stuff
I did with the angel group

197
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,000
we tried to go

198
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,520
we only look for companies that already
have initial traction in revenue

199
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,160
and we try to help them
scale up as much as we can

200
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,560
we have over 100 investors, 100 LPC

201
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,080
so what I had before in the four to six

202
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,000
investors in the Angel group
just did the same thing

203
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,040
much bigger

204
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,400
and all these people, as I said,
some of them are extremely helpful

205
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,920
you probably know several of them

206
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,600
and they are people that come from all

207
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,400
fields, from that Cadena,
from different businesses

208
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,600
we have business women and men from
all walks of life that you can imagine

209
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,640
so what what are some of the challenges
of running a fund with over 100 LP is

210
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,280
because on one hand you want to really
utilize their their strong backgrounds

211
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,640
and their expertise, whether it's
in due diligence or in deal sourcing

212
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,520
but at the same time, you sort of have
to please a hundred different people

213
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,480
and you know the saying,

214
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,840
you put a hundred percent right two Jews
in a room, you get six opinions

215
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,800
so I can't imagine what
so not Jewish, by the way

216
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,040
they're not only Jewish people thank God

217
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,120
we have people from all walks of life and all
ethnicities, all backgrounds

218
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,800
and happily the people who invest
in maverick, don't invest in mavericks

219
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,600
because of the, say, ethnical aspect
of it being a Jewish homeland

220
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,040
and so on, they just think it's a place
that they can get a high return on

221
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,440
and then how do you balance

222
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,400
how do you balance this expectation
that you'll please everybody while

223
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,880
at the same time
never please anybody

224
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,040
you never please anybody

225
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,720
but you need to first of all, you need
to do a few things, first and foremost

226
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,960
and I say this to every person
who wants to be coming out

227
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,520
and the company is I bluntly tell them
there's a very good chance you'll lose all

228
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,200
your money investing in venture
funding in our venture fund

229
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,200
it makes sense
as well

230
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,920
secondly, we try, we don't try to please

231
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,280
them, but we do try to do
is to do everything possible to reach

232
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,880
the best outcome we can
and to be a go between their

233
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,960
abilities and their connections
and what the companies seek

234
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,040
so each one of these investors in our
mindset has the ability to be helpful

235
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,960
to each one of the companies,
to many of their companies,

236
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,320
people who have gone to like
imagine you in 10 years from now

237
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,040
you'll you know, you will
have your alumni association

238
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,000
you'll have all the friends that you've

239
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,520
had, your past jobs in education
and so on and so forth

240
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,280
and you'd like to be helpful
to the companies where you'd also like us

241
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,920
to be as respectful
to your time as possible

242
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,440
so we like to keep to make sure that we

243
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,480
know exactly what each person
could bring to the table

244
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,880
on one hand and then the other hand,

245
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,560
not to assume that you do
not have connections to

246
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,160
A juice manufacturer in Australia

247
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,240
because maybe you randomly do

248
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,920
and so we tried to sort of, you know,

249
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,280
plan that thin line and be still very
respectful to the to the LPs time

250
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,120
and the way we do this is we send

251
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,400
a quarterly report and then we have to do
a page at the very beginning with what

252
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,240
with three points at each company,
like assistance

253
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,160
interesting,
say, staffing up position like a CFO

254
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,200
they're looking for a CFO
to open an office in the east coast

255
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,480
they want, you know, a connection
to this or that conglomerate

256
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,680
or as anybody has

257
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,800
no experience in a specific tax question
that they may have,

258
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,040
and you will just know, right, that
oftentimes people have something to add

259
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,480
and that's what differentiates us

260
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,120
we act with the same
passion that we had as an Angel group

261
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,320
I want to believe we have the same thing
now when when it's people's private money

262
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,560
it's different than when you're,

263
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,520
of course, and you have raised
money from institutional

264
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,760
and again, of course, not all
the LPs are, you know, very active

265
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,080
many of them surprise you
of course, yeah

266
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,920
no, I have to say that, you know,
I'm a part I'm with a now

267
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,680
at J-Ventures and I and we
also we are a great guy

268
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,200
yeah
over 100 LPS

269
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,400
and it's just so humbling to see that,

270
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,200
you know, people are people are
putting their time, their effort

271
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,000
and I keep
and it's amazing how much of it

272
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,080
they put in and how
willingly they want to help

273
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,400
and when it's not, you know,

274
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,520
for a salary of or because they have to,
but because they want to,

275
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,840
they raise their hand and say, yeah,
I want to be a part of this, of this

276
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,440
company and its due diligence
or this or helpless portfolio

277
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,080
you see so much value that they bring and

278
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,480
and you write that out of, over hundred

279
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,600
potential LPs, sometimes get
these jems that are really random

280
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,920
with a connection to a a juice
manufacturer in Australia

281
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,680
Yaron, I have to ask about a hood that's
Allar United, that's a large group and one

282
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,920
of the most inspiring
organizations and entrepreneurship

283
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,520
elements of Israel

284
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,560
talk to me a little bit about it

285
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,000
and what's your role over there?

286
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,440
I will, just before I get into that,
I want to go back one step and say that

287
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,680
our LPS are from all over the place
and thank, thank God,

288
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,800
really one of the best things to have
happen to remember,

289
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,360
we said there is that moment when I
got that phone call from my first part

290
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,160
yeah
and an Angel group

291
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,240
and then the second moment that I had was
when I met who Michel Abadi,

292
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,800
who was my partner, has been my partner
since the inception of the fund of Maverick

293
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,800
he is originally from Brazil
he lives in Israel, though,

294
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,560
now for 16 years,
and his network spans of Latin America,

295
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,160
which is a humungous
area that people tend to forget

296
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,000
yup
you know, when it comes to this field

297
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,200
and we have investors from Europe and from
Australia, from other parts of the world

298
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,640
so we're very heterogeneous
in terms of the backgrounds

299
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,000
amazing

300
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,920
and of course, I have really inhuman

301
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,520
Michelle and I really complement each
other and we work very well together

302
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,240
that's something very important

303
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,080
I can give one tiny advice to all the
inspiring new people watching

304
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,000
if there's anyone watching that wants

305
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,320
to set up a company of any kind
is to always make sure to do that

306
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,560
what is considered counter-intuitive,
which is to not surround yourself

307
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,120
by people that have the same background,
sets you up from school

308
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,000
his background, he's an engineer by trade

309
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,440
he's a banker

310
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,280
he just

311
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,480
we're very different

312
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,720
and we are very, very close and really
complementors,

313
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,920
about this, so also going back to the
fact that we have only private investors,

314
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,960
it's one of the second reason

315
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,400
second reason we only
have private investors

316
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,480
first, of course, is there potential
added value

317
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,360
which has proven
itself time to time again

318
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,320
is the fact that we decided

319
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:20,080
from the get go to donate two percent
of our funds carry of the success of the fund

320
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,760
to United Hatzalah,
which you mentioned United Hatzalah

321
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,480
in my opinion, it's the most amazing
organization that I've come across

322
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,560
and I think that it embodies two things
that are important to me and to everyone,

323
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,240
which is, again, entrepreneurship,
because what they do is very innovative

324
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,480
what they decided to go against this flow
yeah

325
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,800
and secondly is a very basic
essence of saving lives

326
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,043
take action into their own hands

327
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:48,960
what's that?
taking action into their own hands?

328
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,040
literally bypassing

329
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,640
not waiting for anyone else

330
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,960
and what they do

331
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,640
they started as a guerilla
operation in a way

332
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,520
and to them, too,

333
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,800
I was introduced by that same farmer
markers from the very beginning

334
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,280
and

335
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,200
what they do is they formed
an organization which is similar to Uber

336
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,560
if you think about it
yup

337
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,360
which is an organization that has over

338
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,440
6000 volunteers spread out
throughout all of Israel

339
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,160
and these are people that go around their
day to day jobs or whatever they're doing

340
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,840
and they have, and they are located

341
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,440
they all have medical training and
equipment and they are

342
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,400
first responders
first to get to the first responders

343
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,800
stabilize, whoever is
injured in car accidents, burse

344
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,480
heart attacks, stabbings, terror attacks

345
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
God willing, God forbid they nominate all

346
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:46,080
these other things and they get
to eighteen hundred calls a day

347
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,440
eighteen hundred calls a day?
yeah

348
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,040
and it's all for free

349
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,520
never charge
anything from anyone ever

350
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,280
I also have a few ambulances to help
transport people who just can't pay

351
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,040
are not able or not willing to pay
for transport to a hospital and all

352
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,320
and they just do good

353
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,480
they have people who help with

354
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:16,160
psychiatric help and psychological help,
and they help Holocaust survivors

355
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,960
they help the needy

356
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,880
they are basically a bunch of angels that
it's almost a matching organization

357
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,600
and by the way, similar to startup,
you want to make sure that their

358
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,040
money that goes into them is spent
in a lean manner,

359
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,520
of course
and that's something they could see their

360
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,340
money there goes
the vast, vast majority of it

361
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,840
to buying medical supplies

362
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,600
you're not just, you're not just a fan
you are

363
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,580
you're on the board of of United

364
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,920
yeah, I'm on the board for the
past over a decade

365
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,480
incredible
there are many wonderful people

366
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,160
and

367
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,240
I've decided that my start

368
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,600
trumpet left two to only focus on one
thing and to do it as well as you can

369
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,680
and every single person that I meet,
I introduced in praise and talk about this

370
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,160
organization, because this organization is
the essence

371
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,240
of being a light onto the nations, which
is what the Jewish people ought to be

372
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,760
and this is one organization

373
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,080
they are trying to setup all over the world

374
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,520
this isn't a Jewish thing

375
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,640
we we have many, many Muslims and many,

376
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,800
many Christians,
many women, many male, chiaradia,

377
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,240
which is the ultra-Orthodox
totally secular people

378
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,520
and we're doing the same thing all over

379
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,840
the world where we want
people to copy this

380
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,080
we want this

381
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,080
I myself was in Brazil
when they opened it

382
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,800
Lithuania
New Jersey

383
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,800
Jersey City

384
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,760
in other parts of the world

385
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,560
and this is exactly what we want
we want Israel

386
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,200
this is our exit of a startup company

387
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,300
we want this
to go global

388
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,400
to go global
I love it

389
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,360
just save millions of lives

390
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,120
I love it
Yaron

391
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,400
I can't believe we're
already over 20 minutes

392
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,320
it went by way, way too fast

393
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,960
I have to put you on the spot once
and there and ask you for three words

394
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,600
that you would best describe yourself
or that others would describe you,

395
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,480
whether it's Michelle or
Ellie Bear from United Hatzalah

396
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,280
what are three words that were
really and embrace Yaron Carni

397
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,829
annoying,
good,

398
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:19,000
funny

399
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,960
and a good friend
I love it to these two people

400
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,360
I love it Yaron

401
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,480
thank you so, so much
stay safe

402
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,120
stay healthy
thank you for the inspiration

403
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,800
thank you so much
thank you
