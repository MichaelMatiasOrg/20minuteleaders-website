124
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,240
All right.

125
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,000
Lisandro Brill, thank you so much

126
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,360
for joining me on the show.

127
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,440
I really, really appreciate it.

128
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:02,760
Thank you.

129
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,560
Pleasure.

130
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,680
It's so great to have you.

131
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,440
I'm so excited to learn as much as I can

132
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,400
over these next 20 minutes

133
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,840
about your so, so fascinating life.

134
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,200
As a journalist, television,

135
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,680
and then going on to venture capital.

136
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,040
You've made some incredible investments,

137
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,080
An expert on Latin America.

138
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,440
And I just want to hear as many stories

139
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,200
as I can fit into these 20 minutes.

140
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,320
Lisandro, take me back

141
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,720
to your days of journalism.

142
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,480
Who are you?

143
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,480
I studied economics

144
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,840
at the University of Buenos Aires

145
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,880
in Argentina and never

146
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,280
expected to be a journalist.

147
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,760
But I started as a journalist

148
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,880
in economic section

149
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,840
of a major newspaper, Argentina.

150
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,240
But I never want to be a journalist.

151
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,769
So, I made my degree at Harvard USA.

152
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:47,330
Afterwards came back to Argentina,

153
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,320
As everybody does, of course.

154
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,320
Well, there's a second-class University

155
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,400
there at the East Coast

156
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,000
of the United States.

157
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,440
Then I came back to Argentina

158
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,960
and I became unexpectedly

159
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,480
when I was 32 years old,

160
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,440
Undersecretary of State

161
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,480
for Foreign Trade for the nation.

162
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,400
And this was absolutely unexpected for me

163
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,320
after I graduated from Harvard.

164
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,320
And during my 10 years tenure

165
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,600
at the government,

166
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,600
I reached a conclusion that really

167
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,680
the problem that I was facing

168
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,560
Latin America was that there was not

169
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,040
investment capital for pushing the talent

170
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,760
of Latin America towards global markets.

171
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,360
And this was venture capital.

172
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,960
So, wait wait. Explain to me.

173
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,240
So, dumb it down for me.

174
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,320
You're sitting there.

175
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,800
You're working within the government,

176
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,440
You're overlooking what's happening.

177
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,920
And what is this realization again?

178
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,680
You realized that the innate problem

179
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,120
of the emerging markets is that

180
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,800
there's just not enough venture capital?

181
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,240
I would say that for emerging markets

182
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,200
that want to expand themselves

183
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,800
into value added products,

184
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,760
into innovation.

185
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,520
There was no venture capital.

186
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:58,760
Okay.

187
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,200
And I thought that venture capital

188
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,680
was a crazy idea that,

189
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,760
because when I was the student at Harvard,

190
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,120
there was a guy there that invented the

191
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,840
tools to do the simulation of the cases.

192
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,360
And so I plugged in his software,

193
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,760
was a classmate of mine

194
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,880
in my Apple II 1764K

195
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,400
This was in 1980.

196
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,840
And this was the invention

197
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,400
of the electronic spreadsheet.

198
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,160
It didn't exist the electronic spreadsheet.

199
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,520
This was invented as

200
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,560
under the name of BICS and CALP.

201
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,760
Yeah.

202
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,960
You were not born.

203
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,200
Nope.

204
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,560
Afterwards came MultiPlan.

205
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,640
After cames Lotus.

206
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,240
And Lotus was fantastic.

207
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,000
Because you could key

208
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:48,480
in your keyboard and transform

209
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,120
a bunch of numbers into

210
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,240
a graph interactively.

211
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,640
And this was Lotus.

212
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,800
I know this is all story.

213
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,000
Everybody now is under Excel.

214
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,000
But the concept of

215
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,040
electronic spreadsheet was invented

216
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,560
at a Harvard Business School.

217
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,800
Between a person that wanted

218
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,400
to save time in preparing the cases.

219
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,480
And a guy from MIT.

220
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,880
I crossed the river to the

221
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,640
Kennedy School of Government.

222
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,760
And imagine what happened.

223
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,120
There was a huge discussion there.

224
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,480
Huge discussion was,

225
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,480
well, listen, this was 1980.

226
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,120
Listen, who owns the patent?

227
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,520
And the discussion was the patent

228
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,260
should be owned.

229
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,160
One-third by the inventor.

230
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,680
One-third by the laboratory

231
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,873
of the Harvard University.

232
00:07:33,878 --> 00:07:36,760
And one-third by the university endowment

233
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
as a whole.

234
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,400
And when this was fixed,

235
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,960
how to split the ownership of the patent,

236
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,720
the guy receiving millions of dollars

237
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,880
to develop a genome project.

238
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,160
So, I thought this is crazy ideas

239
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,120
that happen only in the States.

240
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,880
But I came back to Argentina,

241
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,280
Latin America.

242
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,240
I realized that even Latin America

243
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,680
wants to develop a different area

244
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,360
of innovative projects in technology.

245
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,480
We should join

246
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,280
the venture capital world.

247
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,160
And so, I started a venture capital

248
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,480
in 1989 when--

249
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,160
Lisandro, I just want to point out that,

250
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,160
we almost just went past it.

251
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,480
But you were sitting there working,

252
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,120
meeting and discussing entrepreneurship

253
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,000
with the person that invented the

254
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,760
technology behind the first spreadsheets.

255
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,080
But you were getting this inspiration.

256
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,760
And you're sitting and you're understanding.

257
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,960
Wow, all this entrepreneurial spirit

258
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,120
here in Cambridge.

259
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,320
Why don't we have

260
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,200
this in Latin America?

261
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,000
You arrived there in 1989.

262
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,240
What is the entrepreneurial scene

263
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,560
over there?

264
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,240
And what is the venture capital scene

265
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,920
when you go back over there?

266
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,520
Oh, Listen.

267
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,440
Venture capital didn't exist

268
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,920
in Latin America at all.

269
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,600
I'm one of the founders of Endeavour,

270
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,320
which is an NGO that promotes

271
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,040
entrepreneurship in Latin America.

272
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,120
Is the equivalent of a government foundation.

273
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,960
When this was invented, a rich one guy,

274
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,560
This was in 1998,

275
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,880
There wasn't entrepreneur.

276
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,400
Wow.

277
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,520
And so, a guy I was receiving

278
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,160
his office by the assistant.

279
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,720
And the assistant say, "Listen, there's here

280
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,720
a guy on the name of [Peter Kember],

281
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,480
[Alitha Rothenburg] from US

282
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,480
that comes with Lisandro Brill.

283
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,280
They want to do venture capital.

284
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,800
They are here with a backpack.

285
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,160
They are very nice people.

286
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,280
Very nice.

287
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,880
I do not want what they do.

288
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,160
It seemed that venture capital is

289
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,840
something like adventure tourism

290
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,240
in Patagonia, Latin America.

291
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,680
So, people didn't understand

292
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,920
a clue of what

293
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,720
venture capital was about.

294
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,840
And when I wanted to reach

295
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,000
A family office.

296
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:47,240
This happened to me also in 1992.

297
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,600
Explaining what venture capital.

298
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,640
That we have to do incubation

299
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,520
for startups.

300
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,360
After a 20-minute discussion.

301
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,440
The guy that was an older said,

302
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,560
"Listen, I still do not understand.

303
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,680
In this incubator

304
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,280
what kind of chicken you are growing?"

305
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,280
So, venture capital world

306
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,040
did not exist in Latin America.

307
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,160
I would say 1998 with all the boom

308
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,200
of the Internet that was developed

309
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,240
with E-commerce just blew out.

310
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,680
Right.

311
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,040
And so, I was able to raise my first fund.

312
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,400
My first one was underwritten by

313
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,280
Hicks Muse Tate & Furst out of Dallas, Texas.

314
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,160
They were in love with Argentina.

315
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,120
They love Buenos Aires.

316
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,960
They love entrepreneurial spirit.

317
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,040
They loved it.

318
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,120
I say, "How is it possible?"

319
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,520
We have to bring that right through there?

320
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,280
And this was their very

321
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,600
first venture capital firm, I would say,

322
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,640
in Latin America.

323
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,040
We invested $20 million.

324
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,880
And one of the first companies we invested

325
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,600
is very well known by you.

326
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,600
Because it came out

327
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,840
from Stanford University,

328
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,280
Founded by a guy on the name of

329
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:55,920
Marcos Galperin

330
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,480
who just did a copy of eBay, Amazon

331
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,120
and created MercadoLibre.

332
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,560
MercadoLibre today in Latin America,

333
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,640
which you saw only 6% or 7%

334
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,920
of Latin America is under e-commerce.

335
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,320
But today is valued $49 billion

336
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,000
and is just eating the market of retail

337
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,080
in the region.

338
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,480
Not only with e-commerce,

339
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,920
but also, with financial services.

340
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,440
So, this provides an example

341
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,560
that entrepreneurship can happen

342
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,400
this part of the world that can develop

343
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,520
if adequate funding is available.

344
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,720
Especially if you have funds.

345
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,800
And we see some GPs in partners

346
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,520
that know how to grow companies.

347
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,000
Of course.

348
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,000
And now you're actually co-founder

349
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,520
of the Latin America

350
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,200
segment of J-Ventures,

351
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,280
which were both a part of.

352
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,720
Correctly. Because my family

353
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,360
came from prosecutive,

354
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,280
from programs

355
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,640
from Ukraine in 1905.

356
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,840
So, there is a Jewish community of

357
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,600
250 thousand peoples

358
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,200
third after US in America is

359
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,600
the following community of Jewish people.

360
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,320
I belong to this community

361
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,800
and I was very much really

362
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,600
motivated by the vision of

363
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:13,880
Oded Hermoni,

364
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,280
Laura Laver and Jim Cosman

365
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,440
to connect the diaspora of us people

366
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,640
to help develop our threat in our

367
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,920
community with the activity

368
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,040
of doing business.

369
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,480
Which is the same thing

370
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,920
that my father did in 1950s.

371
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,280
I remember my father

372
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,440
when he used to go around

373
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,360
the world doing business in trade.

374
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,960
I said, "Father, but you don't speak English."

375
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,360
And he said, "Well, it is the belief."

376
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,000
"Because I do speak English."

377
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,760
Do you trust my English?

378
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,360
Yes. Yes, I do.

379
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,600
So, he created businesses.

380
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,920
Because he knocked on

381
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,920
with the Jewish community

382
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,640
around the world.

383
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,960
Is an old tradition of our community. Yes.

384
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,800
Okay, Lisandro,

385
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,880
give me your insight

386
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,560
into the Latin America entrepreneurial

387
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,920
and venture capital scene today.

388
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,440
Coming in from Israel

389
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,600
and from the US,

390
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,880
I don't get exposed too much

391
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,800
to what's happening in Latin America.

392
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,200
And the closest I've been there

393
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,120
is to go around and meet

394
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,600
entrepreneurs and VCs in Mexico,

395
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,320
to try and get a little bit of the taste

396
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,160
of what are the challenges

397
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,200
of emerging markets.

398
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,760
Because is it considered

399
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,960
an emerging market,

400
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,440
a developing market

401
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,040
that is still not matured yet?

402
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,960
I'm assuming it is.

403
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,040
But I just want to make sure.

404
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,600
Venture capital is embryonic

405
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,400
in Latin America.

406
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,440
It's very easy.

407
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,200
Latin America is 600 million people.

408
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,720
50% is Brazil.

409
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,720
That's you speak Portuguese.

410
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,560
50% is Spanish

411
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,120
speaking Latin America.

412
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,760
And the most important countries are

413
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,920
Brazil and Portuguese, Mexico, Argentina,

414
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,280
Colombia, and afterwards, the rest.

415
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,960
So, venture capital is

416
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,920
starting Latin America.

417
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,920
By far the most important

418
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,640
country is Brazil.

419
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,720
We have minimum 30 funds in Brazil.

420
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,320
Very much supported originally

421
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,880
by the government.

422
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,680
But also, by the

423
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,840
investors from the Silicon Valley.

424
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,200
You have Kaszek, Monashees,

425
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,680
Redpoint are the names

426
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,640
of the games here.

427
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,040
In Mexico I am a partner

428
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,400
with AltaVentures, and Dalus capital.

429
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,360
They are based there a venture partner in Dallas

430
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,680
and is a smaller country.

431
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,360
But I would say that Brazil and Mexico are

432
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,560
the two only countries in Latin America

433
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,480
that can develop

434
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,120
the J-curve of venture capital.

435
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,480
That means companies domestically

436
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,360
that can grow

437
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,760
to the size of being big plays.

438
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,520
So, for example, we have

439
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,680
our most famous case may be a NuBank.

440
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,320
That is $40 billion market cap.

441
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,120
Is a FinTech company in Brazil.

442
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,320
But you have a Didi's,

443
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,000
which is the Uber originally of Brazil

444
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,840
that was sold to Didi

445
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,560
in China for a billion dollars.

446
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,680
And you have in Mexico

447
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,320
companies such as Clip

448
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,040
That is a square,

449
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,400
In the US, they are valued well above

450
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,360
about half a billion dollars today.

451
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,240
And of course,

452
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,480
this is a part of the story,

453
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,480
which is deals basically with IT.

454
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,560
With software.

455
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,160
I am not pushing a lot,

456
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,760
bringing Israeli technologies and

457
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,840
Silicon Valley technologies

458
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,760
invested by J-Ventures to Latin America

459
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,360
in the AgriFood tech space.

460
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,000
You have a nice company there

461
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,200
in J-Ventures based in Monteview

462
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,160
of Palo Alto on the name of Big Hero

463
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,800
that is trying to enter Latin America.

464
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,840
Because they do colonization

465
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,840
and they increase

466
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,840
the productivity of crops by 30%.

467
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,840
Incredible.

468
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,280
I think how much contribution

469
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,680
you can make to food security

470
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,600
around the world.

471
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,040
And saving these around the world. Yeah.

472
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,720
Of course. Of course. Of course.

473
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,520
And Argentina and Brazil are great

474
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,240
places for crop production.

475
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,560
We can feed in the world

476
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
minimum two billion people.

477
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,400
And we are only, let's say,

478
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,480
200 million people,

479
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,920
250 million people inhabitant.

480
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,960
So, we have the capacity

481
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,920
because you have the technology there.

482
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,880
You have the artificial intelligence.

483
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,120
But in order to embed proteins

484
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,320
into something that is called food,

485
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,520
you need land and water so far.

486
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,040
And Israel and California have land or

487
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,520
water to feed and create these proteins.

488
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,080
This is being done here in South America

489
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,440
as a major destination.

490
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,160
So, what do you just,

491
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,000
I just want to clarify.

492
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:44,280
You just said that Latin America

493
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,840
there are places that accumulates

494
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,720
to about the population

495
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,440
of 200 million.

496
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,160
But the land and the potential

497
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,360
is to grow food

498
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,520
that can feed two billion?

499
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,120
Yes, I yes.

500
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,600
Because Argentina's a country of

501
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,960
40 million people,

502
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,320
has land and water

503
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,080
with adequate technology

504
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,510
to feed the billion people.

505
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,400
It sounds like a gold mine.

506
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,960
It sounds like these places

507
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,960
have so much incredible potential

508
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,000
that why are entrepreneurs

509
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,460
wasting their time here in Palo Alto

510
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,120
building in new social apps

511
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,000
for millions of people?

512
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,600
If they can go to Latin America

513
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,960
and work on problems

514
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,160
that can feed billions.

515
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,920
It sounds like it's a much better idea

516
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,120
to go to Latin American

517
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,760
and do technology there, no?

518
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,680
Well, it's an untapped continent.

519
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,960
So, I would say that our role,

520
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,040
your role Matias,

521
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,920
is the role of J-Ventures,

522
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,240
It's exactly to connect

523
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,440
these communities,

524
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,920
with the philosophy of Ticuna land.

525
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,920
Yes, of course,

526
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,510
As Oded like to say

527
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,640
Oded Hermoni likes to say,

528
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,310
as Laura Logan likes to say,

529
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,480
as Ronald Cohen likes to say,

530
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,880
That we listened to him last week.

531
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,160
And of course, there is a lot of opportunity

532
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,560
in as much as you bother with people

533
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,280
that know how to cope

534
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,790
with our characteristics.

535
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,960
Because you take a New York guy

536
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,600
that went to Harvard or to Stanford

537
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,750
and he lands in Be'er Sheva

538
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,480
and he lands in Tel Aviv.

539
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,320
I am sure that he will not go

540
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,750
with their shoes holds back.

541
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,880
[--]

542
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,030
He would have to adapt.

543
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,310
He would have to partner.

544
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,960
So, I would say that the secret

545
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,960
is to have a global thinking,

546
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,640
to capture opportunity.

547
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,110
And you have the knowledge

548
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,790
and experience to act locally,

549
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,000
to deliver globally.

550
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,520
Wonderful. Okay, Lisandro,

551
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,880
So, you know, I came to Stanford

552
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,400
from my military service.

553
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,600
A lot of my friends went to go

554
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,960
do startups and go work.

555
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,000
But I felt that I didn't understand

556
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,160
what are the biggest problems

557
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,110
that the world needs to be solved?

558
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,200
And what are the biggest things

559
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,440
in Ticuna land that I can do

560
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,280
that are both profitable,

561
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,400
but also have a great

562
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,510
net positive impact for the world.

563
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,510
And so, I'm taking up on this offer.

564
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,600
I'm finishing here--

565
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,030
If it's about food.

566
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,960
It's about health.

567
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,960
It's about housing.

568
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,320
Okay. So, Lisandro the deal is that

569
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,040
I'm finishing up this degree here

570
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,000
and then I'm coming to Latin America,

571
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
I'm taking you as a mentor

572
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,640
and you're showing me

573
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,720
how I can use deep technology

574
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:29,480
to solve big problems in your continent.

575
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,720
More than welcome. I am in debt of you.

576
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,920
OK. Wonderful.

577
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,550
Okay, Lisandro, amazing.

578
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,800
We have this on record,

579
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,750
So, this is fantastic.

580
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,160
But I want to spend the next five minutes

581
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,790
or so talking about your passions.

582
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,600
What are you truly excited about

583
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,720
as an investor, as an entrepreneur,

584
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,560
as a thinker, as a Ticuna lawmaker?

585
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,920
My passion is human development

586
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,200
and progress.

587
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,840
What does that mean?

588
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,120
Human development and progress

589
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,560
is to live in a world

590
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,320
where basic needs

591
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,000
in terms of nutrition,

592
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,010
15 [--] calories per person.

593
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,960
Education.

594
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,790
15 years of education, guaranteed

595
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,440
Health.

596
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,440
Access to health as you have in Israel.

597
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,200
[--]

598
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,350
They are in California.

599
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,680
And let's say 25 square meters per

600
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,800
person for living

601
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,200
Once you have these,

602
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,320
you are assured that you have the freedom

603
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,440
to choose and become a free person.

604
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,920
A citizen of the world.

605
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,080
I love this.

606
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,760
And do you know who invented

607
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,880
this concept of developing economics

608
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,960
with these human development approach?

609
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,480
This was invented in Silicon Valley

610
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,120
by a guy who was a human psychologist

611
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,160
on the name Maslow.

612
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,240
I was just about to say

613
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,280
the Maslow pyramid,

614
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,590
which talks about this idea

615
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,800
that you need the foundations

616
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,000
before you can reach fulfillment.

617
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,480
So, my passion is to connect

618
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,830
venture capital with it.

619
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,960
Abraham Maslow pyramid,

620
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,600
To develop human needs.

621
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,520
To push for human freedom

622
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,400
on a global scale.

623
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,830
And this is the only, in my judgment,

624
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,790
a guarantee for security.

625
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,550
Wow. Unbelievable.

626
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,640
So, does that guide

627
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,160
your investment strategy

628
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,480
and the types of projects

629
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,200
that you're working on?

630
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,080
Obviously, you're taking up your precious

631
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,120
time and you're working also

632
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,240
with the J-Ventures, an early stage fund.

633
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,600
But is this from in the mindset of

634
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,640
I'm going to take on projects that have

635
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,070
the potential to reach meaningful

636
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,350
net positive outcomes on human lives?

637
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,600
I am always fascinated by impact investing.

638
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,070
During the 90s, early this century,

639
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,680
impact investing, the name of the game was

640
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,550
creating great companies,

641
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,590
creating big companies

642
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,310
and creating Endeavor, my NGO

643
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,110
that we invented in Argentina.

644
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,640
Now we are in 25 countries

645
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,480
around the world

646
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,550
to promote economic development.

647
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,200
But as of today I will say that creating

648
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,680
this world has not been enough.

649
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,560
Now we have applied to this technology

650
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,360
to which called impact investing,

651
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,720
which is what we have heard.

652
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,110
J-Ventures from

653
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,280
Ronald Cohen.

654
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,160
Yes.

655
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:27,160
About the environment sustainable

656
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,840
that have inclusion potential

657
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,360
to feed people, to nurture people,

658
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,640
to provide for health.

659
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,800
And no doubt that food tech

660
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,600
and health tech

661
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,830
would be major areas of investment.

662
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,080
Because for me, the offices,

663
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,560
institutional investors,

664
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,480
are pushing

665
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,680
the venture capital private equity industry

666
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,120
to invest in the things that make

667
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,400
the world more sustainable.

668
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,000
100%. Lisandro,

669
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,280
That's just so inspiring to hear.

670
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,480
Before we leave and I can't believe

671
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,680
20 minutes are almost up.

672
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,480
We have just a minute left.

673
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,800
But I want to know your three words

674
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,280
that you would use to describe yourself.

675
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,680
And I'd love an explanation about them,

676
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,320
because I think that your

677
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,920
your mindset is fascinating.

678
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,400
Your ambitions are incredible.

679
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:15,040
And I just love this notion of going

680
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,160
through your journey both as

681
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,760
an entrepreneur, venture capital,

682
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,720
you non-government worker.

683
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,240
With the mindset of improving humanity

684
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,720
and freeing the people

685
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,400
from the shackles of a food,

686
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,310
of water, of health, of living.

687
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,280
So, please Lisandro,

688
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,830
three words that best describe you.

689
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,480
Passion for human development,

690
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,440
fellow for world security.

691
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:36,450
Ticuna land.

692
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,880
Okay. So, ticuna land.

693
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:39,890
It's all about that.

694
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,880
It's all about that impact. Right?

695
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,520
Right.

696
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,480
Okay. Lisandro one tip

697
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,040
that you would give me

698
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,800
or any other entrepreneur

699
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,000
that starting their journey.

700
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,860
Impact investing and Ticuna land

701
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,480
is not necessarily in the mindset

702
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,200
of every young entrepreneur today

703
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,440
going into this world.

704
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,960
So what is one thing that I should

705
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,160
keep in mind as I go through my path?

706
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:05,650
Travel.

707
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,520
Know the world.

708
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,720
Connect deeply

709
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,680
with the people around the world.

710
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,720
Because you have a fantastic background

711
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,200
coming from Israel.

712
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,200
You can connect your world.

713
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,790
The Stanford world with these people.

714
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,280
And we are now sure that we

715
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,920
live in a global system where

716
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,160
everything is interconnected.

717
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,720
It's the time of the pandemics of covid.

718
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,080
It's the time that people realize

719
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,760
that we are in one world

720
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and we have to connect

721
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,960
to each other in a positive sum game.

722
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,320
100%, 100%.

723
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,480
