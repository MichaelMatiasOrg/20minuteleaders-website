1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,999
This is a super fragmented environment.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,359
Right?

3
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,879
Now, when every insurance company

4
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,879
is trying to do their own thing

5
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,999
and try to propose its own model

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,719
and it's not unified and it's not tapping

7
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,960
into the same data feeds and incentives

8
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:16,959
and it's so fragmented, there's no way

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,600
something meaningful can happen

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:45,999
Oron Afek,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,279
thank you so much for joining me

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,279
on 20 Minute Leaders.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:48,719
How are you?

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,639
I'm good, Michael.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,439
Thanks for having me here.

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,599
So, two really interesting things

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,079
to start off.

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,079
First of all, you're in Wyoming, right?

19
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,399
Even though you're based

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,640
out of San Francisco.

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,759
Yeah, yeah.

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,400
What is that about?

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,720
After corona started,

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,000
my wife and I decided to just, you know,

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
take this journey

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,080
and start working remotely

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,600
from multiple places.

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,520
And I've been living in the US

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,600
for seven years now.

30
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,640
And it's the first time I actually

31
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,600
experiencing it from the ground,

32
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:20,680
instead of from the air.

33
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,720
You know, those little,

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,400
20 minute trips from the airport

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,160
into a meeting back to the airport.

36
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:26,839
It's for the first time

37
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,960
I can experience the nature.

38
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,960
And Jackson Hole, Wyoming,

39
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,080
was one of the more attractive

40
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:34,639
destinations for us to spend some time.

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,400
So, trying to work from the road now.

42
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:38,399
And it's been amazing.

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:38,759
I love it.

44
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,200
I love it.

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,960
So, just as fascinating as that is,

46
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,760
you also do Ironman, right, yearly?

47
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,040
Yeah.

48
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,960
Trying to keep in mental shape,

49
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,400
and it comes with a physical requirement.

50
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,760
So, I try to,

51
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,600
I originally started to do it for

52
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,720
just for the challenge.

53
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,480
But over the time,

54
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,440
it's been like a mental therapy

55
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,040
and a great travel destination thing.

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,320
So, you know, I've been in New Zealand,

57
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,760
I've been in Mexico.

58
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,880
Places I wouldn't go otherwise

59
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,520
if I hadn't had

60
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,600
you know, an event.

61
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,840
It is unbelievable.

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,480
So, you know, for a lot of people

63
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,400
doing these Ironmans

64
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:19,959
are almost a full time job

65
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,240
because of how intense they are.

66
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,000
So, just for the ear,

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,680
tell me a little bit about

68
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,240
what is the distance for the

69
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,440
running, cycling,

70
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,400
and for the swimming portions?

71
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:31,600
Yeah.

72
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,760
Well, the folks are doing it

73
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:33,479
full time job,

74
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,600
actually good athletes are.

75
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,400
I don't consider myself a good athlete.

76
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:38,959
I just do it for the sport.

77
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,680
So, the distances would be, you know,

78
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,400
3.8 kilometer swim,

79
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,840
followed by 180 kilometer bike ride,

80
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,200
and with a marathon finish.

81
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,520
So, it's pretty intense.

82
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,640
It sounds very, very intense.

83
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,680
And I'm sure that just as intense

84
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,960
as the Ironman experience,

85
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,160
is running a startup in the health space

86
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,520
and med tech space is just as intense.

87
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:06,079
So, tell me a little bit about

88
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,360
about what VIM is,

89
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,120
the company that you're

90
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,680
currently running.

91
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,960
Yeah. Sure.

92
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,760
So, VIM is something we started back

93
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,480
in 2015,

94
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,760
you know, maybe a year or longer,

95
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,840
if you consider the time

96
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,960
it takes to plan and to get ready

97
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,120
to get a company funded

98
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,880
and get off the ground.

99
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,800
VIM is a operating system

100
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,680
for health care networks.

101
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,000
So, we operate solely

102
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,760
in the United States,

103
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,360
which is a story

104
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:32,479
by itself how we got here

105
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,680
and how we started this thing here

106
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,800
in the US, a bunch of Israelis.

107
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,000
But think about it this way.

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,160
In Israel, we have two

109
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,800
or three large HMOs,

110
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,200
health maintenance organizations

111
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,800
like Maccabi, Leumit,

112
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,760
and so on and so forth,

113
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,680
similar to Kaiser, maybe here in the US.

114
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,760
Fully integrated payer

115
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,960
and medical provider

116
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,400
are part of the same entity.

117
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,120
So, full alignment of interest.

118
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,800
And everything is very streamlined.

119
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,560
The physician would like to see you

120
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:03,559
to prevent costs from happening.

121
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,439
In the US, it's kind of different.

122
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,959
The system here was established

123
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,320
as a fee for service system.

124
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:11,319
So, it's what you would maybe know

125
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,919
from a world of lawyers or accountants,

126
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,719
you know, people that would bill you

127
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,559
by the hour, time and material, right?

128
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,039
So, physicians here actually

129
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,080
have the wrong incentive, in my opinion.

130
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:22,279
Which is, you know,

131
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,119
treat you when you're sick.

132
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,559
There is a lack of incentive

133
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,800
of keeping you healthy.

134
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,640
There's an incentive to render more care

135
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,440
when you're getting sick.

136
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,240
This also is driven because of this

137
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,120
separation or

138
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,160
the institutional separation

139
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,560
between the payer and the provider.

140
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,760
So, you have insurance companies

141
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,720
on one end,

142
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,080
Unitedhealthcare, Cigna

143
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,160
and so on and so forth,

144
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,800
and you have medical providers.

145
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,400
In your case,

146
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,320
you're probably very familiar

147
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,480
with Stanford, Sutter Health

148
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,280
and all those guys.

149
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,600
So, basically the separation between

150
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,720
church and state is actually not good

151
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,280
in healthcare.

152
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,280
A dismissal of incentive,

153
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,440
given that physicians are actually

154
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,360
charging on a fee for service basis,

155
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,400
hence they render more care,

156
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,640
they're getting paid more.

157
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,880
And the insurance companies would like

158
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,840
to get to pay less

159
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,560
to maintain profitability.

160
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,320
And that inherent conflict of interest

161
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,120
combined with the IT fragmentation

162
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,560
is a huge problem resulting in this

163
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,240
almost four trillion dollar cost.

164
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,640
Which is three times more per capita

165
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,320
than any other OECD country.

166
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,280
So, what VIM does in all this chaos,

167
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,280
By the way, Oron, you know,

168
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,680
while we're saying this, you know,

169
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,760
I understand the magnitude

170
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,520
of what you're saying,

171
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,160
and while you're talking about this,

172
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,160
all I'm thinking about is that at VIM,

173
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,600
you have millions of Americans

174
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,240
at the end of the day

175
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,640
through all of this,

176
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,000
you know, misalignment,

177
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,600
and through all this disincentives

178
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,760
that we're introducing into the economy,

179
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,600
we have millions of Americans that just

180
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,640
don't have proper health benefits

181
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,120
and they don't get taken care of

182
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,040
when they need.

183
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,160
They get sick when they

184
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,000
don't need to get sick.

185
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,040
And when they do get sick,

186
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,600
they can't pay the bills.

187
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,880
And so, obviously, you know, on one hand,

188
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,000
a lot of people are going out

189
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,520
and they're solving these

190
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,800
trillion dollar problems,

191
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,160
that of misalignment in the economy.

192
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,159
But what you're doing here,

193
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,800
even more than that,

194
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,440
you're actually working on

195
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,840
on improving people's lives.

196
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:12,719
Which not every startup can come and say

197
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,480
that you're directly impacting

198
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,400
whether a person perhaps lives or not,

199
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,920
or gets to get treatment

200
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,000
when they do get sick.

201
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,600
So that's just, to put in perspective,

202
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,760
it's a huge problem.

203
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:24,359
I believe more than half of Americans

204
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,280
don't have $400

205
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,840
in their bank accounts to pay

206
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,720
in the case of emergency.

207
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,040
And so, you know, it's even greater

208
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,640
when it's a fee for service

209
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,360
type of model.

210
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,000
But sorry. Go ahead.

211
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,080
No. I appreciate you

212
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,720
mentioning the saying.

213
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,360
You know, it's easy to forget sometimes

214
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,240
that we're doing something

215
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,160
that is very special

216
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,320
and helpful for people.

217
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,360
And, you know, myself and the company

218
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,960
in particular, are very driven people.

219
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,080
And we're doing it, first and foremost

220
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,360
to make a difference,

221
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,200
not for economical reasons.

222
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,400
We truly believe there is a huge

223
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,760
financial opportunity

224
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,440
side by side with fixing the system

225
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,200
just by taking the excess cost

226
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,880
out of the system.

227
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,040
Yeah.

228
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,160
So, it's incredible.

229
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,760
And you mentioned 50% of Americans

230
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,880
have less than $400

231
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,720
or less available cash

232
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,640
in their account at any given time.

233
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,120
Take this into consideration

234
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,680
with the huge deductibles

235
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,640
that people need to pay

236
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,760
before their insurance even kicks in.

237
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,200
Because during the past 15 years,

238
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,000
there was a huge shift

239
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,920
to cost to the patients, right?

240
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,360
So, insurance companies would just

241
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,160
be puzzled of how they're going to pay

242
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,560
those bills and say, let's prevent people

243
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:35,519
from using the health care

244
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,719
in the first place by shifting more costs

245
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,400
and making you responsible,

246
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,800
so they stop being opportunistic.

247
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,760
So, the average family deductible

248
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,200
is now 3500 bucks

249
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,960
for a year, per year.

250
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,640
And with 400 bucks for 50% Americans,

251
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,400
it means no access to health care.

252
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,080
So, I mean, look,

253
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,680
we can't do everything we want, right.

254
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,640
So, VIM had to focus on one area

255
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,560
where we can actually, make a difference.

256
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,400
So, what we've been focusing on

257
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,720
the past five years is actually

258
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,080
building this connectivity tissue between

259
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,160
insurance companies and physicians.

260
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,400
Now, physicians is not a physician,

261
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,680
so you have like

262
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,480
maybe a thousand different,

263
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,080
we call them EMRs,

264
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,440
electronic health records or

265
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,960
electronic medical records, you know,

266
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,320
those old operating system

267
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,440
that sit on those provider offices

268
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,680
and maintain the data

269
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,840
and help to prescribe drugs

270
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,800
and so on and so forth.

271
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,200
And obviously billing.

272
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,720
Which is the main function

273
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,560
of those systems.

274
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,480
And those systems

275
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,280
don't talk with each other,

276
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:34,680
and they don't talk

277
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,520
with the insurance company.

278
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,320
So, we make them all talk

279
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,760
and enable ease of access to data

280
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:42,719
and ease of transfer of data.

281
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,479
And what we believe

282
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,799
this is going to become,

283
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,799
we believe it's going to become

284
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,319
the operating system of the network

285
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,679
of health care and thus become the

286
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,360
the ground work or the infrastructure

287
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,680
for value based care.

288
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,119
What is value based care?

289
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,079
It's a world where incentives

290
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,759
are aligned between

291
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,759
insurance companies and physicians.

292
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,559
So, doctors are rendering care

293
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,359
in order to get you healthier.

294
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,999
And they're actually enjoying the

295
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,840
downstream cost savings of your health.

296
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,960
That's what they actually monetize,

297
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,280
not the individual service.

298
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,160
So, think about a physician

299
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,240
who is incentivized to render better care

300
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
and for your long term benefit

301
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,520
in keeping healthy.

302
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,160
That's how she's actually

303
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,480
making money downstream,

304
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,520
not from rendering more care,

305
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,480
but by rendering less care.

306
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,720
And to actually make this happen,

307
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,400
you need connectivity,

308
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,840
you need data to flow,

309
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,160
you need incentives to flow.

310
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,000
And that's what VIM does.

311
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,600
VIM is building this operating system

312
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,240
to enable value base care.

313
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,440
And we are very passionate about it.

314
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,960
So, I'm deeply curious

315
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,920
about what you're saying.

316
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,480
I just need another explanation here

317
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,880
just to make sure I fully understand.

318
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,640
So, how do you change the alignment

319
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,440
so that a physician doesn't get the value

320
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,400
from the service, but gets a value

321
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,280
from the patient's well-being?

322
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
How does that work?

323
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,840
I understand the connectivity between

324
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:01,359
the systems and the fact that you need

325
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,159
some sort of operating system

326
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,400
to handle all that communication

327
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,480
across the board.

328
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,560
But how does that change

329
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,400
the incentive of the physician

330
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,960
versus the insurance company?

331
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,480
Because today, swiping the credit card

332
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,840
happens at the time of the ailment.

333
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,040
Right?

334
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,320
Yeah. Absolutely.

335
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,240
So it's a really good question, Michael.

336
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,200
So, I think the rule of thumb is

337
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,880
is in one word is, capitation.

338
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,520
If you think about a doctor

339
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,160
in Israel or Australia or in the UK,

340
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,360
whatever single payer system

341
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,480
you can think about,

342
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,760
they're getting a salary.

343
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,640
And that salary is adjusted in accordance

344
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,560
with the number of patient they see.

345
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,000
So, think about moving to a similar model

346
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,760
where the primary care physician,

347
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,320
the GP, the person who are managing

348
00:10:47,321 --> 00:10:51,519
your total health, she's making a PMPM.

349
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,440
Per member per month fee.

350
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,040
Let's say she's making 600 bucks

351
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,080
per month for the patient's health.

352
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,320
Right?

353
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,360
If it's an older patient,

354
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,800
let's say that they consume more care.

355
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,120
If it's a younger patient, maybe 250,

356
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,680
300 bucks a month for the patient's care.

357
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,240
Right?

358
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,760
So, she's getting that.

359
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,480
And she is responsible for the total cost

360
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,160
of care of that patient.

361
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,640
Wow.

362
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,480
So, from now on,

363
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,040
she becomes a mini insurance company.

364
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,000
And on the back end,

365
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,320
you have infrastructure supporting

366
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
stop loss and other things.

367
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,400
You guys may be familiar

368
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,840
in your other day job that you guys

369
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,000
are thinking about all day

370
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,360
how do you ensure

371
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,920
the insurance companies, right,

372
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,200
and so on and so forth.

373
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:33,799
But assuming she has this

374
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,440
infrastructure behind her,

375
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,800
she's basically able to be

376
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,360
rendering more care

377
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,880
to prevent downstream cost.

378
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
And she's fully incentivized to do so

379
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,920
because she's getting that PMPM.

380
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,880
By the way, it's amazing

381
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,200
because think about coronavirus,

382
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,720
those physicians been struggling

383
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,000
with having office visits

384
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:58,239
and people come to them.

385
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,640
They've been losing

386
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,560
most of their business

387
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,200
in the first months of coronavirus

388
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,280
because people didn't show up.

389
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,200
They didn't go to see the doctor.

390
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,480
If the doctor gets paid PMPM,

391
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,120
it's getting paid whatever happens, right.

392
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,320
So, now you see this huge

393
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,320
willingness of doctors

394
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,720
to switch their model

395
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,920
into a PMPM capitated model.

396
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,480
So, that's an amazing thing

397
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,640
that happened in the past year.

398
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,680
So, that's what we also see a big growth

399
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,040
for our opportunity.

400
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,120
And then we have specialists.

401
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,840
The specialists are not

402
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,800
primary care physicians.

403
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,640
They don't need to think

404
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,840
about people's total health.

405
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,800
They need to think about specific

406
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,320
condition and procedures to render.

407
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,520
And so, there's a different type

408
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,480
of capitation that may happening

409
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,320
for specialists.

410
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,480
I think about it as bundle payments.

411
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,680
So instead of let's say

412
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,360
someone is giving birth

413
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,040
and seeing a 300 page bill

414
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,960
with three thousand line items that say,

415
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,760
that breaks down the anesthesia

416
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,040
and the hospitalization

417
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,920
and the consultations and the MRIs

418
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,320
and the CT-scans and the ultrasounds

419
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,720
and whatever happens

420
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:06,159
in that specific episode,

421
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,400
instead you have a surgeon who would say,

422
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,920
I'm going to do this delivery

423
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,960
in $30,0000.

424
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,120
Whatever happens, happens.

425
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,200
And I'm responsible

426
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
for total cost of care for that episode.

427
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,880
So, if you cap the PCP, the primary care,

428
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,880
the GP on a per member per month basis,

429
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,040
and you cap a specialist

430
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,800
on an episode basis,

431
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:30,239
you can really form a marketplace, right,

432
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,640
of value based care.

433
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,880
You stop paying for services.

434
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,720
You're paying for people's health

435
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,760
by incentivizing

436
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,200
in their own a per service basis capped or

437
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,000
on a per member per month basis capped.

438
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:44,879
You incentivize the individuals

439
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,919
to just do what's good for the system.

440
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,479
And I believe you see,

441
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,120
I actually believe it's the,

442
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,400
and it's a longer conversation

443
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,120
than 20 minutes,

444
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,800
but I believe it's actually the answer

445
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,240
for other health systems like

446
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,760
Israel and the UK and Australia,

447
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,640
where the single payer system

448
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,280
is bankrupting because of over demand

449
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,920
for private services.

450
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,240
So, I actually think this can solve

451
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,000
all the Western world problems.

452
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,520
If we can actually build this model.

453
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:16,159
Oron, how do you get to educate

454
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,440
a new market in health

455
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,840
and creating a new economy

456
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,440
between customer, patient,

457
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,400
doctor relationship and insurance,

458
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,560
that whole triangle?

459
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,720
You know, this is something that the US

460
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:29,519
has been dealing it with for many years.

461
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,960
Obama, obviously, put it

462
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,080
at the forefront of his campaign,

463
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,280
this idea of how do we provide

464
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,960
accessible health care.

465
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,040
We've seen the disastrous rollout

466
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,720
of Obamacare very unfortunately,

467
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,160
because I think it served

468
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,640
a fantastic purpose

469
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,400
of fundamentally allowing people

470
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,640
access to health care,

471
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,000
which you're giving that same access,

472
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:54,799
but in a different, and perhaps,

473
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,000
even more meaningful way.

474
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,280
What leads you to go

475
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,160
and create this whole

476
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,640
new economy and new marketplace

477
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,680
for doctors, for physicians,

478
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,800
insurance companies and patients?

479
00:15:05,801 --> 00:15:05,919
Yeah.

480
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,960
I think these are two great question.

481
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,040
So, the first question, maybe,

482
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,400
I'll start with answering this

483
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,400
like what's different in what we do.

484
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,240
Because it's obviously the approach

485
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,560
I'm presenting is not my idea.

486
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,960
People have been thinking about it

487
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,240
for 50 years now.

488
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,840
But I think there's something different in

489
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,800
what we do over what we've done before.

490
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:24,999
And the second question is like,

491
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,440
why are we doing it.

492
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,840
Why we approach this problem

493
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,240
and what kind of motivated.

494
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
So, let me answer

495
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,680
the first question first.

496
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,879
So, you know, I mean,

497
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,039
every physician in the United States

498
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,319
is on average, is contracted with,

499
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,120
you know, one large federal insurance,

500
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,040
usually Medicare, purely responsible

501
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,520
for 50% of my business as a doctor.

502
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,840
And then another

503
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,080
20 or so insurance companies,

504
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:54,839
commercial insurance companies,

505
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,239
some of them are seeing

506
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,919
Medicare advantage,

507
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,239
some of them seeing commercial population

508
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,239
like large employers, whatever,

509
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,599
this is a super fragmented environment.

510
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,119
Now, when every insurance company

511
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,119
is trying to do her own thing

512
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,239
and try to propose its own model,

513
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,559
and it's not unified

514
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,359
and it's not tapping into the same

515
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,200
data feeds and incentives

516
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,200
and it's so fragmented, there is no way

517
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,920
something meaningful can happen.

518
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,960
And the doctors not adopting

519
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,560
those offerings because they only apply

520
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,360
for a small subset of their patients.

521
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,240
What VIM does is that we aggregate

522
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,640
those insurance companies.

523
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,760
And we're proud to have to serve

524
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,280
the largest insurance companies

525
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,880
in the United States.

526
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,200
So, think about Anthem,

527
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,760
UnitedHealthcare,

528
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,400
those two companies alone have almost

529
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,640
a hundred million Americans

530
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,720
covered under them. Right?

531
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,680
And you're probably familiar with both.

532
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,920
And we cover additional ones.

533
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,480
So, I think as an aggregator

534
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,800
of insurance companies,

535
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,480
we're actually able to represent

536
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,200
a bigger portion of membership

537
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,560
and talk with physicians

538
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,040
in a way that it appeals to them

539
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,520
to really change behavior

540
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,640
and alter the incentives

541
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,719
and so on and so forth.

542
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,040
As per the second question is,

543
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,160
I guess, it's a more difficult question.

544
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,160
What led us to start.

545
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,440
So, I can personally speak for myself.

546
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,240
My co-founders can tell their own story.

547
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,440
Yael and Asaf,

548
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,440
will be delighted to be on your show.

549
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,040
But my personal story is just frustration.

550
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,920
Pure frustration

551
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,120
from my own personal career.

552
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,320
I was actually very much enjoying

553
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,480
my time in the military.

554
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,920
I feel I'm contributing.

555
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,760
I feel like I'm making a difference.

556
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,840
And then, you know,

557
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,760
when I started to become an entrepreneur,

558
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,640
basically, I never really worked

559
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,240
for a company.

560
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,600
I was trying to start my own thing.

561
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,320
And I think the two main companies

562
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,360
I was involved,

563
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,680
one is in the telecommunications space

564
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:42,799
selling to large mobile operators.

565
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,320
And the other one is in the gaming space

566
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,080
selling to big gambling,

567
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,960
online gaming companies.

568
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:51,239
And not to discount any of the values

569
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,159
of those two areas

570
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,319
are driving for the world.

571
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,800
I haven't felt fulfilled and driven

572
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:01,039
doing those things.

573
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,639
I felt like the economical impact

574
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,480
on my personal life

575
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,799
was pretty much gone after I made,

576
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,759
you know, I would say a little,

577
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,399
a little pocket of change that I could

578
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,959
afford to pay rent and maybe some more.

579
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,559
And I felt like that's not really

580
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,799
making any more difference for me.

581
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,960
I'm trying to really think about

582
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
something that will make a difference.

583
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,720
And the first thing,

584
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,640
it wasn't health care.

585
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,200
The first thing was I want to start

586
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,800
a business with mechanics

587
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,080
that I'll be passionate about.

588
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:32,719
And I put a spreadsheet and I said,

589
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,239
this will exercise, you know,

590
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,840
if I could start any type of company,

591
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,600
10 years ago,

592
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,320
what I would start in the names

593
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,160
on the spreadsheet were

594
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,680
Amazon and Uber and Airbnb.

595
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,800
And, you know,

596
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,320
it wasn't Google, it was Apple.

597
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,480
It wasn't any of these. Right?

598
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,600
And I was thinking,

599
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,880
what is the common denominator.

600
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,280
And I saw that marketplaces

601
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,480
is what I'm really passionate about.

602
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,160
I started reading everything

603
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,080
about marketplaces,

604
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,840
including the Everything Store,

605
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,160
which is the Amazon early book

606
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,080
that really inspired a lot

607
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,720
of what you see in them

608
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,600
from my standpoint.

609
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,320
And so, you know, as a frustrated

610
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,360
builder with a hammer looking for a nail,

611
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,840
I was looking for my marketplace

612
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,600
to be built and Obamacare

613
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,000
was starting to emerge back in 2014.

614
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,800
And it looks such a natural,

615
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,760
natural place for me to try something.

616
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:20,999
Right.

617
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,040
So, it's like huge variation of cost

618
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,400
with no difference in quality.

619
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,200
It's like retail 25 years ago.

620
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,560
Right.

621
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,600
I mean it's just amazing opportunity.

622
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,120
And cost and quality variation

623
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,040
in healthcare is the biggest disparity

624
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,600
in everything else in the world.

625
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,520
I mean, US healthcare is the most,

626
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,680
the biggest market with variation

627
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,080
that you can ever imagine.

628
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,600
So, I thought it's a great opportunity.

629
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,920
And I didn't know anything

630
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,760
about health care back then.

631
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,680
I don't think I know too much today.

632
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,280
But I think I know a little bit more.

633
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,360
And I feel very lucky to stumble upon

634
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,280
this amazing opportunity

635
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,120
in an industry and people.

636
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,080
And it's been fun.

637
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,440
I think it's fascinating

638
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,920
and it's inspiring for me to hear

639
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:06,719
about the shift in you.

640
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,800
And sort of self responsibility

641
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,440
that you took over

642
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,560
your own contentedness, happiness

643
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,840
and satisfaction and fulfillment, right?

644
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,440
I mean, I believe that

645
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,880
they've done multiple studies on happiness,

646
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,560
and satisfaction levels of people.

647
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,600
And multiple levels of satisfaction

648
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,160
and fulfillment of people.

649
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,240
And they found that there is the,

650
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,640
as you approach, I believe,

651
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,600
80 or $90,000 a year salary,

652
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,880
it's actually like a logarithmic curve.

653
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,280
Your happiness shoots up

654
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,920
as you are able to feed your family

655
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,120
and pay your rent.

656
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:43,519
But then as you reach that

657
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,320
80, 90, 100,000,

658
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,400
it starts leveling out.

659
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,840
And then the extra money doesn't actually

660
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,000
make a difference in fulfillment.

661
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,640
And that's where you go

662
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,000
and you find your passion.

663
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,840
And I just love that.

664
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,800
Oron, thank you so much

665
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,880
for being on the show.

666
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,400
Thank you for being

667
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,440
so generous with your time.

668
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,600
This was inspiring for me

669
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,000
and it's inspiring me

670
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
and hopefully my friends as well

671
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,000
who are listening to this

672
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,320
to go and tackle these big, big problems

673
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,160
that are both very

674
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:06,439
economical for a startup,

675
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,319
but also just a huge impact

676
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,760
on people's lives.

677
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,480
But before we go,

678
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,200
I have to ask you

679
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,840
the most important question,

680
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,360
which is three words that you would use

681
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,240
to describe yourself.

682
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,760
And the hardest question.

683
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,920
Yeah.

684
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,760
Well, you know, the first one is easy.

685
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,480
I think I'm pretty driven.

686
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,800
You just described why.

687
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,040
And I think it's a really

688
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,720
good description.

689
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,320
I'm really not motivated by money.

690
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,240
I'm motivated by impact.

691
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,280
I think I rediscovered myself.

692
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,600
I'm 38 now.

693
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,960
So, I rediscover myself in the age of 30.

694
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,320
The second one is

695
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,480
fortunately or unfortunately,

696
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,600
I'm pretty optimistic.

697
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:50,919
So, I need to try and see the horizon,

698
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,000
the full picture

699
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
and what's going to happen

700
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,640
and try to believe in this

701
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,160
and try to be part of that.

702
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,680
I am truly optimistic

703
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
the US healthcare system

704
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:01,800
is going to change because

705
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,360
if it's not going to change,

706
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,760
we're going to have a 20% GDP problem,

707
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,040
kind of problem

708
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,880
emerging in the next couple of years.

709
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,840
It's ridiculous, right?

710
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,880
So, something need to change.

711
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:14,199
So, hopefully to be

712
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,039
in the right set of a change.

713
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,960
The third one is pretty tactical, I think.

714
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,920
I think I'm pretty decisive.

715
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,280
So, I mean, there is an unlimited

716
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,320
number of literature, pages, articles,

717
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,240
people you can speak

718
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,320
with in this industry.

719
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:34,159
And it's not never going to be enough.

720
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,159
And I think just me coming

721
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,080
from a place of zero knowledge,

722
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,040
don't know what I don't know.

723
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,079
In the long term my co-founders

724
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,759
and we try to make a difference

725
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,079
in this industry, decisiveness

726
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,799
is a really important feature.

727
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,959
And I think those three maybe describe me

728
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,119
at least in 2020,

729
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,279
or in the past seven years,

730
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,280
they describe me pretty well.

731
00:22:59,360 --> 00:22:59,880
I love it.

732
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,440
Oron, thank you very much. Toda raba.

733
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,800
Enjoy the rest of your time in Wyoming.

734
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,000
Thank you for making an impact

735
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,080
in a lot of people's lives.

736
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,520
And stay safe and stay healthy.

737
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,440
You too, Michael. Thanks man.
