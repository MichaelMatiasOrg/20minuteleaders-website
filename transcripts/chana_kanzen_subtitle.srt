00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,900
Chana Kanzen,

2
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,880
thank you so much for joining me.

3
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,680
How are you?

4
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,200
I'm very well, thank you.

5
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,080
I know you're extremely extremely busy.

6
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,000
So, thank you for taking the time

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,680
to do this.

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,040
You're the CEO of Jewish Interactive,

9
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,560
a non-profit organization,

10
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,200
very successful non-profit organization.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,920
But you're an educator at heart.

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,680
A teacher by profession.

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,640
And you have your own views on education

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,800
and what needs to happen

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,160
in order to improve education

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,600
and spread messages to children

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,760
around the world.

18
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760
Right now, you're focusing

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
on Jewish education,

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,400
but you're passionate about

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,120
the broader sense of education

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,560
and how to do that more effectively.

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,320
So, I'd love to hear a little bit

24
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,360
about your journey.

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,000
We'll start from there.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,440
And we'll talk also, obviously,

27
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,600
about Jewish Interactive

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,320
and what you're doing over there.

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,080
Sure. So, I've been a teacher

30
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,280
for about 20 years.

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,480
Started teaching every age group

32
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,640
from little ones right through

33
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,520
to high school.

34
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,640
And I've always been really passionate

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,480
about good education

36
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,720
and getting the kids excited.

37
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,880
And I feel it's a really important role.

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,640
And about 10 years ago,

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,160
I was actually leading a school.

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,640
I was approached

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,360
by the current chief rabbi actually

42
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,240
in the UK to open up a school.

43
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,600
So, I like challenges.

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,160
And I decided,

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,600
okay, I'll open up a school.

46
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,480
But I wanted it to be a beacon school.

47
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,560
I wanted it to be a school

48
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,960
that would be a model for other,

49
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,640
especially Jewish schools to look at.

50
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,040
And we worked really hard.

51
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,400
By the way, just for context,

52
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,480
when you're saying

53
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,680
you're a teacher for 20 years,

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,800
is this specifically Jewish education

55
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,040
or what sort of teaching did you do?

56
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,600
No. I was a qualified teacher

57
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,200
to general studies.

58
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,520
And about halfway through my career,

59
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,440
I actually started to work

60
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,640
in Jewish schools and realized that,

61
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,240
actually, anywhere up to 50% of the day

62
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,080
in a Jewish school

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,200
is devoted to Jewish education.

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,160
But what I found fascinating

65
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,960
was the delivery and actual relevancy

66
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,080
of the education for that 50% or 20%

67
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,560
or 10% was just not very good.

68
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,280
The teachers weren't always qualified

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,680
or they didn't have good resources.

70
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,760
And I found that quite disturbing,

71
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,560
actually, that parents are choosing

72
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,960
to send their kids to a school

73
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,920
for that reason.

74
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,000
And yet the education

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,040
that was being delivered

76
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,160
was not on the same standard.

77
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,600
So, I decided to move

78
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,800
being a qualified teacher

79
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,960
into the Jewish faith

80
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,160
to try and up the game.

81
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,280
And so, we opened up this Jewish school,

82
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,960
the beacon school

83
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,080
and it was very exciting.

84
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,760
And this was 10 years ago,

85
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,960
more actually, about 13 years ago.

86
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,200
We started opening a school

87
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,000
and smart boards were just coming in.

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,800
And it's amazing how much things

89
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,320
have moved in the past 13 years.

90
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,000
But if you think back,

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,880
we didn't even have iPhones then.

92
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,960
It was like really computers.

93
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,440
Were just coming into school

94
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,520
and it was just the beginning

95
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,320
of the technology boom.

96
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,840
It was the Facebook.

97
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,260
I remember those smart boards,

98
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,480
I remember them coming in

99
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,120
and slowly being placed

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,360
in the classrooms. Right.

101
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,760
Right.

102
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,120
So, because we're new school,

103
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,720
we had smart boards in every classroom.

104
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,080
It's really cool.

105
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,240
And I had great stuff to put on it

106
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,520
for math and English,

107
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,560
and it came to Jewish studies.

108
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,160
And it just really wasn't anything

109
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,920
except for some Chabad videos.

110
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,120
And I was just thinking,

111
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,040
this is crazy.

112
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,920
Like there's just no good content

113
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,360
for religious education.

114
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,040
And in parallel,

115
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,560
what's going on is that

116
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,320
you've got the world is just going crazy.

117
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,880
And religious education is really about

118
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,000
mainly morals and inclusivity

119
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,040
and living good lives.

120
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,720
So, as people

121
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,960
most general religions like that.

122
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,360
And yet, the way it was being delivered,

123
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,560
it was in a very old fashioned

124
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,520
paper-based worksheets.

125
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,240
So, these kids were experiencing

126
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,440
English and math in this

127
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,400
really virtual exciting way.

128
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,000
And then the religious education

129
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,120
was very 2D.

130
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,960
And that, for me was a really big problem.

131
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,880
And I met this girl

132
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,680
who came from South Africa,

133
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,400
her name was Nikki Neufeld.

134
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,440
And she had this CD

135
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,480
that she had made about Shabbat.

136
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,040
And she put it in my computer

137
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,880
and it was like Disney animation,

138
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,680
blew my mind.

139
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,000
I haven't seen anything like this before

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,640
and it's just like,

141
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,880
"Where have you been all my life?"

142
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,960
"This is exactly what I need."

143
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,360
I can't even imagine.

144
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,400
Disney animation is about Shabbat.

145
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,760
Yeah, it was like

146
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,320
this whole animated Disney style.

147
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,880
Amazing CD and the amazing story

148
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,400
was that she had created this,

149
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,320
she wasn't an educator,

150
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,040
but she had created the CD

151
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,520
on bedrest throughout her pregnancy.

152
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,760
She couldn't get up

153
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,160
and she had this idea

154
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,160
to create digital content

155
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,520
and she made this CD.

156
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,240
So, she came.

157
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,360
And I didn't even watch it.

158
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,680
Like she put it in my computer

159
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,360
within first seconds,

160
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,060
I was like, "I love it."

161
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,440
She's like, "But wait, see the rest of it."

162
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,040
"I don't need to see anymore."

163
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,600
"I want my school to use this."

164
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,400
"This is what we need."

165
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,800
"But why isn't it online?"

166
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,480
"And where is your educational guide?"

167
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,560
"And where's your lesson plans?"

168
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,560
And I was just grilling her

169
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,760
and she was like,

170
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,760
"Okay. Okay, I need you

171
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,440
to come and work with me."

172
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,800
And at that point,

173
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,600
I have been in education,

174
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,800
formal education all my life,

175
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,680
salary jobs, I was training and lecturing

176
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,600
and doing all sorts of things.

177
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
But I never thought

178
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,240
about leaving the security of a salary

179
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,320
and starting something,

180
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
especially a non-profit.

181
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,440
I had no non-profit background at all.

182
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,800
It was a funny story, actually.

183
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,400
I remember I went to see a funder

184
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,080
to potentially get office space

185
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,520
for Jewish Interactive.

186
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,040
And she said to me,

187
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,160
"So, have you got a boards?"

188
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,520
And I said,

189
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,440
"So, what's a board?"

190
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,520
That's how green I was.

191
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,680
Like, I literally did not know anything

192
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,040
about what I was doing.

193
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,560
I just knew I had this vision.

194
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,520
I knew that this is something

195
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,000
that needs to be done.

196
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,840
So, I have to say already kind of that,

197
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,680
a lot of people

198
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,560
that are coming on this in the series

199
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,600
are the entrepreneurs, investors,

200
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,880
a lot of them coming from the tech scene.

201
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,160
And over there, going to the tech scene,

202
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,640
the route is pretty known that

203
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,680
when find the pain point,

204
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,120
you raise money, you go build a startup.

205
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Now you're coming in,

206
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
which I think is fascinating

207
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,800
as 20 years into education

208
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,840
and you're saying that,

209
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,640
Okay. While I'm teaching general studies,

210
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,920
I'm seeing that there is this gap

211
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,480
and the way that Jewish education,

212
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,200
it doesn't necessarily have to be Jewish,

213
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,400
but in general, there is a gap

214
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,080
that a certain segment of education

215
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,720
is not receiving, is not getting

216
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,960
the quality education that it needs.

217
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,640
There's this gap.

218
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,880
I'm going to create a school

219
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,280
that is going to do this better.

220
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,360
And then you find somebody

221
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,040
who is actually leveraging technology

222
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,480
to actually make this

223
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,720
much more interactive.

224
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,760
I just think that it's fascinating

225
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,480
to draw the parallel because this is

226
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,720
pure entrepreneurship right there.

227
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,280
It really was.

228
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,480
I mean, she basically

229
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,600
was almost like an investor.

230
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,120
So, she had this trust fund set up

231
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,280
that she wanted to devote

232
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,400
to developing this.

233
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,920
But she didn't have the mechanism.

234
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,560
She wanted to pilot it in England

235
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,960
because it was a small community.

236
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,120
And I happened to be quite good networker

237
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,920
and I was networked with all the schools.

238
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,480
So, we just gathered or I gathered.

239
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,280
I got in contact with all the principals

240
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,680
and we did this release and we did this,

241
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,960
we just released the product

242
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,560
without even having a company.

243
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,720
So, basically what we did was

244
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,800
we had this whole day

245
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,480
and 70 teachers turned up.

246
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,600
It was unheard of.

247
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,720
Like 70 school appeared

248
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,400
and by the end of the day,

249
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,480
they were signing checks

250
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,400
to Jewish Interactive, which didn't exist.

251
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,360
So, I walked away

252
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,160
with like $6,000 in checks and no company.

253
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,400
Wait. So, were they trying

254
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,560
to purchase the product or donations?

255
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,960
Yeah. So, we are almost like

256
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,080
a social enterprise.

257
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,200
So, what we do is we believe

258
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,600
in charging for some of our products

259
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,440
because we want to bring in revenue,

260
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,480
sustainable revenue,

261
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,840
but not to make a profit.

262
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,040
Any revenue that we bring in

263
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,200
goes to the non profit.

264
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,000
And also, because the Jewish market

265
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,920
is quite small, it's not sustainable.

266
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,960
So, most technology,

267
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,880
the way that they work is scalability

268
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,280
and mass consumption.

269
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,480
But even if we reached

270
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,280
every single Jewish child in the world,

271
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,760
it wouldn't really be profitable.

272
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,680
So, we need to tap

273
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,160
that non-profit element into it.

274
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,480
But at the same time,

275
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,640
this was at the beginning

276
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,160
of the technology boom,

277
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,760
which was having an impact on education.

278
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,080
So, I left my job

279
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,560
and I started Jewish interactive.

280
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,480
But at the same time,

281
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,920
I was advocating

282
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,160
for different approaches in education

283
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,120
because what I could see is

284
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,720
I saw something remarkable happen.

285
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,240
I walked into my classroom of 30 kids

286
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,040
with an iPad and it wasn't even open,

287
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,560
and it was like bees to honey.

288
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,720
Like all of a sudden

289
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,520
I had 30 kids around this iPad

290
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,520
with this engagement

291
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,880
that I had never seen before

292
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,160
with anything else that I did.

293
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,400
And if you are a passionate teacher

294
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,120
and you want to get something across,

295
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,960
then you're going to use

296
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,240
the most effective way of doing them.

297
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,120
For me, I could see that the levels

298
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,200
of concentration and engagement

299
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,760
on these devices was just unprecedented.

300
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,400
I hadn't seen that before and I thought,

301
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,240
"Whatever happens,

302
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,520
I have to get my head around this.

303
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,800
If I want to get to these kids."

304
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,040
Because this is where they're at.

305
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,360
And the issue that I then had

306
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,440
was years of trying to convince

307
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,840
head teachers and teachers

308
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,880
that we've got to move this.

309
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,840
It's not even debatable.

310
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,160
It's not a luxury.

311
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,320
So, they perceived technology

312
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,400
as this luxury.

313
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,240
And even today, you go into classrooms

314
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,920
and many classrooms are still paper-based.

315
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,240
The kids are writing,

316
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,320
handing in their results.

317
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,480
They don't get their results

318
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,920
'till two weeks later.

319
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,800
And how does that correlate

320
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,760
with these kids' day to day experience

321
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,480
of instant gratification.

322
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,000
There are multiple platforms

323
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,760
that accessing huge levels of information

324
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,040
and yet the teaching,

325
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,000
the education methods have not moved on.

326
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,440
So, what's happening are

327
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,680
a lot of teachers who haven't moved on

328
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,400
are still focused

329
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,760
on delivering content and information,

330
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,160
which is just not where,

331
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,360
the kids don't need to know

332
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,080
and be delivered huge amounts

333
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,920
of information any more on rote learning.

334
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,880
What they need to do

335
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,720
is learn how to access

336
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,160
the right information.

337
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,960
They need to learn how to collaborate,

338
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,920
how to access and build relationships,

339
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,480
emotional intelligence,

340
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,760
all of these other skills

341
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,200
that are so vital for jobs today

342
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,920
are not being taught.

343
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,360
So, what I did, I actually made

344
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,520
some connections with Google and Apple

345
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,200
and we started to train.

346
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,520
We actually had a couple of trainings

347
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,320
in Apple headquarters in London

348
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,920
for all the Jewish teachers in the UK.

349
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,080
And Google helped as well

350
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,760
to try and train these teachers

351
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,200
in embedding technology

352
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
into their classroom.

353
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,880
And it's not just about having a computer.

354
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,720
We can see that now

355
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,000
with covid really quickly.

356
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,920
Really, it's being actually

357
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,960
fascinating for me

358
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,640
to watch over the past six months

359
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,360
what's happened.

360
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,680
Because what's happened

361
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,800
in the past six months,

362
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,640
I've been advocating for years.

363
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,960
And all of a sudden education has moved,

364
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,880
I would say, more in the past six months

365
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,320
than it has in the past 20 years.

366
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,400
It's unbelievable how, now,

367
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,000
every single teacher

368
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,080
has had experience

369
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
with online education,

370
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,720
whether they like it or not.

371
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,400
Some have been really successful

372
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,960
and some have been really frustrated

373
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,120
and some children

374
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,040
have been really successful,

375
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,600
and some children

376
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,680
have been really frustrated.

377
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,160
And I think that it's not about,

378
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,720
it's not the technology

379
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,120
that's the problem,

380
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,840
it's you cannot teach online

381
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,960
in the same way

382
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,400
that you've been teaching offline.

383
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,880
You have to change the pedagogy.

384
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,000
And so, that's what

385
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,280
I've been trying to do is

386
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,600
to change people's approach to education.

387
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,920
And instead of

388
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,760
just delivering information,

389
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,080
changing that whole emphasis

390
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,880
unto allowing children

391
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,680
to access knowledge and learn

392
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,760
and be self directed and creative,

393
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,640
which you know, and I suppose

394
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,520
most people watching here

395
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,760
who are entrepreneurs know that

396
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,480
these are essential skills

397
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,360
for entrepreneurship which we know.

398
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,600
Or any learner in the 21st century, really.

399
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Yeah. And quite frankly,

400
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,400
with this new generation that's coming up,

401
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,240
like these kids,

402
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,320
they're going to be graduating

403
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,720
in what? 2025, 2030, right?

404
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,320
Where is the world going to be that,

405
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,080
how many jobs are going to be available.

406
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,160
If these kids

407
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,560
don't have the skills to be creative

408
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,600
and to work in a global way

409
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,400
and collaborate,

410
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,960
they're not going to be employable.

411
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,200
Because all the other jobs

412
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,880
aren't going to exist, right?

413
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,640
The jobs that the teachers

414
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,960
are currently teaching for

415
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,400
will not be there.

416
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,320
So, unless they have experience

417
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,880
in these skills, they're just not going

418
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,840
to be able to survive in the world.

419
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,280
And school is meant to be

420
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,320
priming your children for survival

421
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,200
in the world.

422
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,600
And it's not being doing that

423
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,560
up till now.

424
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,440
I think what's happened with covid is that

425
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,640
the world is sort of,

426
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,120
especially the world of education

427
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,080
is having to rethink.

428
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,680
It's being forced to rethink.

429
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,080
And it's difficult and it's challenging

430
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,880
and not everyone's getting it right.

431
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,800
But it's necessary.

432
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,240
And it's been a really interesting

433
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,480
few months to observe this

434
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,360
going on in the world

435
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,880
and seeing what's working, what isn't.

436
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,000
And I think we've definitely hit

437
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,720
a turning point.

438
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,040
I don't think there's any going back.

439
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,200
I think that technology and education

440
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,000
is here to stay and we've just got to

441
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,160
get our heads around that

442
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,960
and make it work.

443
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,160
And what been great for me is that

444
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,040
I've been privileged to be in a position

445
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,400
for the past 10 years

446
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,520
where I've been gradually working

447
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,680
with a bigger and bigger market.

448
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,240
I now work with a global market,

449
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,520
with schools all around the world.

450
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,920
And so, I'm able to see

451
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,200
what works and what doesn't

452
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,440
and how they're using platforms.

453
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,760
And we're now actually building

454
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,920
a new platform,

455
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,680
not just for the Jewish world,

456
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,960
for everybody.

457
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,200
We're building an open source platform

458
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,320
so anybody can use it.

459
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,640
And the idea of this platform is

460
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,040
for teachers to create content

461
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,680
and children to learn asynchronously

462
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,640
using this content

463
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,120
and build the sharing community.

464
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,480
And so, we're developing this now.

465
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,080
It's really exciting.

466
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,200
And it's really a gift

467
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,880
to be able to develop this platform

468
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,480
during the time of covid

469
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,120
when we've got so many teachers

470
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,040
who are experiencing

471
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,680
challenges and blockages.

472
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,480
And we're trying to get that information

473
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,000
and then build that into

474
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,480
what we're creating.

475
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
So, it's a very exciting time for us

476
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,080
at the moment.

477
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,320
Of course. But Chana, then I have to ask

478
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,720
so, everything that we've talked about

479
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,400
until now, it sounds like it's relevant

480
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,400
for all subjects in education

481
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,680
and for all teachers and for all students.

482
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,520
Why is it Jewish Interactive?

483
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Because it sounds like

484
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,680
even that experience of having that person

485
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,400
come in with a CD

486
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,320
and and sharing those lessons

487
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,920
about Shabbat in an interactive way,

488
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,800
it sounds like the pain point

489
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,240
and the solutions you uncovered

490
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,760
is something that's relevant

491
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,520
for many many other fields, right?

492
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,440
So, why specifically in that market?

493
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,520
Because you're starting off

494
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,960
by also saying that,

495
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,360
inherently the Jewish education market

496
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,040
is so small that you have to position this

497
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,240
as an NGO.

498
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,240
Why not take this to a for profit company

499
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,080
that is trying to help education

500
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,040
all around?

501
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,880
It's a really good question.

502
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,480
There's a few reasons for that.

503
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,240
First of all,

504
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,240
the Jewish market needs specific content.

505
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,440
And what's very difficult

506
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,960
about the Jewish market is

507
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,800
there's a saying that:

508
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,920
if you have two Jews,

509
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,000
you have three opinions.

510
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,880
Right?

511
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,200
So, the same with all the schools.

512
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,960
Every school is unique.

513
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
So, everyone says,

514
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,800
"Why don't you just do

515
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,360
like one curriculum on Judaism

516
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,160
and then you've got it."

517
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,120
And there's been many many people

518
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,400
that have made online curriculums

519
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,200
about Judaism.

520
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,400
So, why do we need to do it?

521
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,040
And the answer is that

522
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,160
every school has their unique,

523
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,840
their USP so to speak,

524
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,080
and every school has their own way

525
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,440
of delivering that form of education.

526
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,920
And that's what makes this school unique

527
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,600
and that's why people

528
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,360
sending their kids at school.

529
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,040
So, what we did was

530
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,840
we developed a platform

531
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,720
that allows people

532
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,000
to create their own content

533
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,960
that's personalized to them.

534
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,120
Now that is relevant to everybody.

535
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,280
You're right.

536
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,000
But someone needed to do it

537
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
for the Jewish market.

538
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,680
And because it wasn't profitable,

539
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,720
who's going to do that?

540
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,640
If you want to start a business

541
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,720
and make it profitable,

542
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,040
you're not going to do something

543
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,760
for the Jewish market.

544
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,440
But unless we actually consciously did it,

545
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,480
there wouldn't be anyone doing that.

546
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,360
So, I had a decision to make,

547
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,760
I could either build

548
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,240
a profitable business.

549
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,440
If I wanted to build

550
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,800
a profitable business, I would have to

551
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,760
not focus on the Jewish content

552
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,680
to make it profitable.

553
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,920
And I just decided

554
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
that I didn't want to do that.

555
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,640
I wanted to give

556
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,880
to the Jewish world consciously.

557
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,040
And in order to do that,

558
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,280
I had to make a non-profit.

559
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,320
I wasn't going to make profit.

560
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,760
And what's actually amazing

561
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,320
about this organization is we have

562
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,480
the most phenomenally talented people

563
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,040
that I've cultivated and brought together

564
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,640
amazing amazing team members.

565
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,760
And they all feel the same way.

566
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,640
They're all doing this

567
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,400
out of a social conscious need

568
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,960
for the Jewish world.

569
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,240
And they're very talented.

570
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
All of them could work

571
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,360
in like Google or Facebook.

572
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,600
But they're doing it because they feel

573
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,960
there is a need for the Jewish world.

574
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,160
So, if you look at other markets

575
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,480
like the Islamic market

576
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,840
and the Christian market,

577
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,960
there are phenomenal phenomenal products.

578
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,200
They have much bigger budgets.

579
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,520
They have much more people for a start.

580
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,560
And they have phenomenal content

581
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,200
And the Jewish world just doesn't.

582
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,440
So, I mean, there are other organizations

583
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,560
that are doing great jobs

584
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,720
for high school and beyond.

585
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,640
But there wasn't really

586
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,880
anyone doing something

587
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,040
for the elementary and middle school,

588
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,840
and we felt that that was needed.

589
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,120
So, it was a conscious decision

590
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,480
to actually be a nonprofit

591
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,960
to fill a need in the Jewish market.

592
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,120
However, you're right.

593
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,480
What we are building now,

594
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,840
the place that we've got to now,

595
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,800
where we're actually building

596
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,520
our own platform,

597
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,240
is consciously being built

598
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,280
for other markets,

599
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,520
not just the Jewish market.

600
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,000
We've taken our learning

601
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,720
because we're quite way a small community.

602
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,480
There's only 5,000 Jewish schools

603
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,560
in the world and we're working

604
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,760
with about a thousand of them already.

605
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
Really?

606
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:28,960
Yeah.

607
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,640
Wow. 20% of the market you're going after.

608
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,280
We do.

609
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,680
We do.

610
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,600
And in over one hundred countries

611
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
so we can really see

612
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,960
the cultural differences

613
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,760
and what's happening.

614
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,000
We've got a global view

615
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,640
of what's happening in education.

616
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,840
So, we can take that information

617
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,920
to develop this platform

618
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,040
and then share it beyond

619
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,080
the Jewish market.

620
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,120
And at that point, it is possible

621
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,440
that we could diversify

622
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,680
and form a for profit

623
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,880
that will help the non-profit market.

624
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,560
But if we wouldn't have focused

625
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,200
on the Jewish market,

626
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,000
then that would still be the spark here

627
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,400
because it isn't profitable.

628
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,440
So, it's like a labor of love

629
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,120
at the moment.

630
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,600
It's something that I wanted to give

631
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,320
to the Jewish world.

632
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,040
And it's not just me.

633
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,960
I wouldn't be where I am today

634
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,240
without a phenomenal team,

635
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,640
phenomenally talented team

636
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,680
who are based in four countries.

637
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,520
And an amazing board

638
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,680
and phenomenal founders

639
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,760
and visionaries who will come together

640
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,960
to do this thing.

641
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,440
So, it's very exciting. Yeah.

642
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,120
That's just unbelievable.

643
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,480
Chana, 20 minutes go by way too fast.

644
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,560
But this is just inspiring.

645
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,920
Incredible, you're in 100 countries.

646
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,680
You're in a thousand schools.

647
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,600
You're in 20% of the Jewish schools.

648
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,120
I mean, that's it.

649
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,200
And the whole story

650
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,480
is just so entrepreneurial.

651
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,800
It's like raw entrepreneurship.

652
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,920
It's just that it's very very inspiring.

653
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,120
And I wish you best of luck.

654
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,200
Thank you for being so generous

655
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,000
with your time. Before we finish,

656
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,800
I have to ask you

657
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
the most important question,

658
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,080
which is three words that you would use

659
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,800
to describe yourself.

660
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,520
Three words I would use

661
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,480
to describe myself.

662
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,200
So, I think, I have to say an educator.

663
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,520
Because I'm passionate about education.

664
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,880
I'll use three words in one word,

665
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,360
like pushing the boundaries.

666
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,880
I like to push.

667
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,720
And resilient. I'm very resilient.

668
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,920
Which you have to be running a nonprofit,

669
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,360
especially in the Jewish world.

670
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,160
And I think to be a teacher,

671
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,280
you have to be resilient to open a school.

672
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,040
You have to be resilient

673
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,240
into run a nonprofit, let alone a company,

674
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,080
you have to be resilient.

675
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,480
Chana, thank you very very much.

676
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,800
Consider doing good for the world.

677
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,680
And stay safe and stay healthy.

678
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,480
My pleasure.

679
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,200
Take care

680
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,680
Thank you.
