185
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,080
Cindy Padnos, thank you so much

186
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,400
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

187
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,880
It's a pleasure to be here. Thank you.

188
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,160
It's so great to have you.

189
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,640
I can't wait to learn so much

190
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,560
as much as I can

191
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
over these next 20 minutes.

192
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,040
You know, I'm not gonna be able to do justice

193
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,400
for all the incredible things you've done.

194
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,040
But just as a background.

195
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,560
You're running Illuminate Ventures

196
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,680
that I think you've deployed over

197
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,720
a hundred million dollars,

198
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,360
and incredible investments,

199
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,120
which I'd love to hear a little bit

200
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,760
about your investment strategy there.

201
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,840
Fast Company has cited you as one

202
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,680
of the most influential women in tech.

203
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,320
San Francisco Business Times,

204
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,400
something similar.

205
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,240
You're very excited about

206
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,000
women in tech in general.

207
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,320
And you have been a widely cited paper called

208
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
High Performance Entrepreneurs:

209
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
Women In High-Tech.

210
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,200
Okay, I've done my part.

211
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,200
Cindy, talk to me a little bit

212
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
about where you come from.

213
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,160
How did you get started with entrepreneurship?

214
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,960
And let's roll into illuminate ventures.

215
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,000
Okay, love to.

216
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
But your first question is a good one.

217
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,200
Because I come from a very

218
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,200
entrepreneurial family.

219
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,920
My grandfather left Eastern Europe.

220
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,040
Built his own business in the United States.

221
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,160
That was then run by my father and uncle.

222
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,680
Then by my four siblings.

223
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,000
Wow.

224
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,920
And now by the fourth generation

225
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,560
that's involved in that business.

226
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,280
So I grew up in that business.

227
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,280
I grew up understanding what it meant

228
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,200
to have integrity.

229
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,040
I understood what hard work was.

230
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,960
I understood what working on weekends meant.

231
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,160
Because I would go into the office

232
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,880
with my father doing

233
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,840
everything known to mankind.

234
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,360
And so, interestingly enough,

235
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,160
I assume from day one that I would do

236
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,400
something entrepreneurial in my life.

237
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,120
But I took an interesting,

238
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,800
circuitous path to get there.

239
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,080
I had to get my MBA at Carnegie Mellon.

240
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,360
I came out of there and actually joined

241
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,640
the largest corporation in the world.

242
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,440
At the time.

243
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,920
And I started really, really big.

244
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,560
And I learned what it was like to sell

245
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,960
into large enterprises

246
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,200
and all the rest of that.

247
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,600
But my first job was actually

248
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,720
a sales position.

249
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,720
Wow.

250
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,400
And I think that's one

251
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,840
of the best jobs you can have.

252
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,440
Including after you get your MBA.

253
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,080
Because you learn about

254
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,560
how to overcome obstacles.

255
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,000
[--]

256
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,400
Cindy,  I'm sorry.

257
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,400
I'm losing you a little bit.

258
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,480
I'm sorry I lost you.

259
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,560
Can you go back to that?

260
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,200
About why the sales is,

261
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,360
Why having a sales position

262
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,520
early on is important?

263
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah.

264
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,600
I think it's really interesting

265
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,240
about having an early role

266
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,400
in your life in sales is that

267
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,360
you are constantly facing

268
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,000
obstacles and objections.

269
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,160
And you learn how to overcome those.

270
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,320
You learn how to deal with adversity.

271
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,720
You learn how to deal when people say no.

272
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,040
And to move on.

273
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,920
And continue feeling that you can still

274
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,160
be successful in spite of one person,

275
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,400
perhaps one customer saying "No".

276
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,600
I think those are skills and learnings

277
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,240
that are really, really helpful as an entrepreneur.

278
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,480
I've heard that quite a few times,

279
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,920
I've heard it quite a few times actually.

280
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,320
That  one of the most important things

281
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,880
to really hone in is,

282
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,280
especially as young entrepreneurs

283
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,440
is to be able to sell.

284
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,960
Which is or almost

285
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,280
counter intuitive to what you know,

286
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,760
I grew up learning is selling is bad.

287
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,360
Just build impactful stuff

288
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,560
and and the people will come to you.

289
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,720
But now I hear a lot of really

290
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,920
incredible people say that

291
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,040
actually having the skill sets

292
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,440
of selling and being able

293
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
to communicate well,

294
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,040
that's incredibly important.

295
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,800
Yeah, I think sales is a really

296
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,760
maligned job and title.

297
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,480
In some companies, I remember

298
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,520
when I was doing this at IBM

299
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,960
you were they were pull up marketers.

300
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,280
And I think this is not marketing.

301
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,000
They're selling.

302
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,520
You know, just face it.

303
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,560
Admit it. Be proud of it.

304
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,520
And I was proud of it.

305
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,440
I was one of the top 10 sales people

306
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,960
in an organization that

307
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,960
had hundreds of thousands of employees.

308
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,880
You were one of the

309
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,600
top 10 salespeople at IBM?

310
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,560
At AT&T.

311
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,720
At AT&T.

312
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,040
Yeah.

313
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,440
Wow. Unbelievable.

314
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,760
And I was very proud of that. Right?

315
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,160
And you had to work very hard to get that.

316
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,920
But it wasn't that

317
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,200
I wanted to be a salesperson.

318
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,240
The rest of my life.

319
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,920
But what a great experience.

320
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,880
I mean, even after my MBA,

321
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,200
the training they put me through

322
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,280
included how to overcome objections.

323
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,000
How to communicate better with people.

324
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,800
Helped me understand my own style.

325
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,160
And how that could relate to other people.

326
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,440
And it was super helpful.

327
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,600
And it also took me down

328
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,240
a notch or two from time to time

329
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,200
when customers just said "No".

330
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,640
Right. Well, I'm guessing that

331
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,920
to get to the top,

332
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,280
then you have a lot of yeses

333
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,440
along with those no's.

334
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,960
So, I'm guessing that

335
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,560
that's pretty incredible.

336
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,160
So, take me to Illuminate Ventures.

337
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,520
And why are you running a venture firm?

338
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,600
Why are you investing in other entrepreneurs

339
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,280
having gone through your path?

340
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,960
That's a great question as well.

341
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,240
I had gotten to a point in my career

342
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,840
where I had been, I've been

343
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,040
at a number of startups.

344
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,720
I had founded my own.

345
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,840
We had been fortunate to have that

346
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,840
be acquired by a public company.

347
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,800
And I started working with some

348
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,520
of my friends in the venture community.

349
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,160
Doing roles that people today

350
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,440
would call venture partner.

351
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,680
Operating partner kinds of activities.

352
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,520
And I had an amazing opportunity to work

353
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,560
with some very respected investors.

354
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,520
I didn't start doing that thinking

355
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,840
I would become a VC.

356
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,280
But over time, I realized that

357
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,880
it was an amazing opportunity for me

358
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,000
to start applying skills and experiences.

359
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,520
And just knowledge sets that

360
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,280
I had acquired over many many years.

361
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,600
And my network.

362
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,440
And I would say the network itself

363
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,040
was perhaps the most important element of it.

364
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,880
I knew investors because I had been out

365
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,960
raising capital for my own company.

366
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,440
I knew entrepreneurs because I'd been

367
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,720
in several entrepreneurial startups.

368
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,680
And I also knew people in the corporate world,

369
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,320
customers, business partners, etcetera

370
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,880
that I could then leverage

371
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
those relationships to help

372
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,680
a whole series of founders.

373
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,080
Rather than just help myself

374
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,920
getting access into those.

375
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,600
And I suddenly started discovering

376
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,680
that even though I had never set out to do it,

377
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,080
I didn't have a finance degree.

378
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,600
I had a very quantitative MBA

379
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,560
from Carnegie Mellon.

380
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,800
But I've never been

381
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,240
on that side of the equation.

382
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,040
I believe you very recently gave

383
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,160
a commencement address. Right?

384
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,840
To the School of Engineering?

385
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,280
The master's program

386
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,920
on the West Coast campus.

387
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,360
Yes. I had a really great privilege

388
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,760
and terrifying to do that.

389
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Because you're always right.

390
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,200
Oh no. You don't want to mess up

391
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,560
someone's college graduation.

392
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,360
There you go. Yeah.

393
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,720
It was a great honor. Yes.

394
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,080
But in any case,

395
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,800
the opportunity for me suddenly

396
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,640
just staring me right in the face.

397
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,720
So, I looked at it and I said,

398
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,320
"Why not create a portfolio versus invest

399
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,040
all of my time and energy in one company?

400
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,520
And why not start giving

401
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,440
back into my community  of the things

402
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,520
that I've learned over so many years

403
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,360
and experiences."

404
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,840
And then I had the good fortune to be

405
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,720
invited to join one of those firms

406
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,640
that I was doing some projects with.

407
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,560
I invested out of their fund

408
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,120
for about four years.

409
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,120
Had an opportunity to build

410
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,800
a track record of it.

411
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,880
Then 2008 came along.

412
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,160
And that was super interesting.

413
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,400
Because the firm I was with have

414
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,960
had offered me a full partnership.

415
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,800
They were going to go out

416
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,090
and raise a new fund.

417
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,480
But I stood back and I realized

418
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,960
how much the world had changed.

419
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,880
When I started my company,

420
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,440
a company called Vivant,

421
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,200
which was a SAS services

422
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,240
procurement software company.

423
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,050
The public cloud didn't yet exist.

424
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,560
And so we had to--

425
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:21,570
When was this again?

426
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,880
That was in 1999.

427
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,520
Wow. So the Internet is about

428
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,120
four or five years old, really. Right?

429
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,600
That's right. No, no, no.

430
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,360
Pre-AWS. That's for sure. Right?

431
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,120
And yet there were companies that were

432
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,880
choosing to move down the path of

433
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,320
having a recurring revenue model

434
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,480
of building a multi-tenant architecture.

435
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,960
But we had to spend a lot of money to do that.

436
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,400
We had to buy all of those tools anyway.

437
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:48,960
We had to spend

438
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,400
hundreds of thousands of dollars

439
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,840
for an Oracle database slice sets

440
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,640
with all sorts of servers.

441
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,640
And then we had to pay

442
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,920
to host everything at Rackspace.

443
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,880
So we created our own.

444
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,240
And that's what every company

445
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,160
them that wanted to do what  SAS had to do.

446
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,960
And then, of course,

447
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,320
brilliant people came after that.

448
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,680
And that's what I stood back and realized,

449
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,080
"My gosh, I needed $2 million

450
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,960
just to start my company."

451
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,480
I needed to buy the servers

452
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,080
of the software and everything else.

453
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,400
Look for the brightest  in the line of code.

454
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,840
And from 2004 to 2008,

455
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,560
I was investing in early stage companies.

456
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,240
But that was still series A.

457
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,200
That wasn't seed.

458
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,840
There was no such word as a series seed back then.

459
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,480
You had angels. And then you had series A.

460
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,080
And I looked at it and I said,

461
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,760
"This is just crazy."

462
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,000
Companies don't need $2 million.

463
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,320
Or $4 million to get started any more.

464
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,680
They need credit card.

465
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,080
And they need some chutzpah.

466
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,040
And they need to go out there.

467
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,120
And start building something.

468
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,130
I love it.

469
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,640
And so that's what I started looking for.

470
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,040
And I realized that there weren't any

471
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,920
seed stage funds that were focused

472
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,280
exclusively on enterprise software.

473
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,760
Most of the people starting funds

474
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,440
that were at that point,

475
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,760
they were called micro VCs.

476
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,680
Most of those funds

477
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,080
were focused on consumer Internet.

478
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,720
Because the people came out of their wall

479
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,840
or came out of some,

480
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,280
more consumer centric kind of a business.

481
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,720
So crazy beans were taken.

482
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,480
Many of them

483
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,920
I must have dosed myself heavily

484
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,000
because in 2009,

485
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,280
right in the middle of the financial crisis,

486
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,120
I decided to launch Illuminate.

487
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,920
To focus on exclusively

488
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,880
seed stage enterprise investing.

489
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,400
So, the world was collapsing

490
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,000
and you're starting a new venture arm

491
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,720
to invest more money.

492
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,240
To spend more money.

493
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,760
Yeah. I love it.

494
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,680
I started the firm and

495
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,920
I launched it in 2009.

496
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,120
And I understood at the time I was

497
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,400
at least smart enough to understand

498
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,360
it wasn't a great time to go out

499
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,520
and raise capital.

500
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,880
So, I started warehousing investments

501
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,400
using my own capital.

502
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,080
And when I went to raise the first fund,

503
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,000
it was small.

504
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,720
It was a proof of concept fun.

505
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,720
And I basically contributed those

506
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,640
investments into that fund.

507
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,840
And they became what we now call

508
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,580
Spotlight Fund.

509
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,560
Which we did a one

510
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,240
and done and closed it in late 2011.

511
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Then we closed our fund.

512
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,800
Roman numeral one in 2013.

513
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,320
and Roman numeral two in 2017.

514
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,960
I guess that was mid 2017.

515
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,840
We started investing from that fund.

516
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,480
And my partner Jennifer joined me

517
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,440
just about a year and a half ago now.

518
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,520
And we'll go raise our third fund. So,

519
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,920
Incredible. Okay.

520
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,280
So, Illuminate over these past,

521
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,040
I guess, 10, 11 years.

522
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,040
How have you noticed this venture arm transition?

523
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,360
As you're gaining more experience.

524
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,480
As you're seeing hundreds

525
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,800
or thousands of companies.

526
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,400
What kind of earned secrets

527
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,200
did you gain over these years?

528
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,480
What kind of secrets have I gave?

529
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:10,920
Earned secrets.

530
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,720
Stuff that only from experience

531
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,280
you could really gain.

532
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,640
Yeah. I think one of them is

533
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,320
to really spend your time finding

534
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,160
the people that you want to work with.

535
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,640
More so than the technologies

536
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,560
of the products or even the markets.

537
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,040
If I've learned one thing, it's that

538
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,600
early stage investing is all about the people.

539
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,120
Right.

540
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
All about the people.

541
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,640
And, of course, you know,

542
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,200
there needs to be product market fit

543
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,120
eventually and all of those other things.

544
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,080
But if you've got the right team,

545
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,160
and you have a much, much

546
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,520
higher probability of success.

547
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,800
Not only that though.

548
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,800
Some of the companies that I've worked with,

549
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,360
I've sat on the boards now at Bright Edge.

550
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,200
It's almost 11 years.

551
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,680
And exactly before we took them public

552
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,440
and then they were acquired by [--]

553
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,960
and that was 10 years.

554
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,440
And so, you really better,

555
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,560
at minimum,

556
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,120
trust and respect the people

557
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,720
that you're going to invest in.

558
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,520
Because you may be working with them,

559
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,640
if you're lucky, for a very long time.

560
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,360
That's the goal.

561
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,440
So, have you ever invested in a company

562
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,000
that you didn't necessarily believe in?

563
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,040
But you really believed in the people.

564
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,040
And you felt that these people are a good, bad.

565
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,360
Maybe the product is not.

566
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,080
But I trust that they'll pivot if necessary.

567
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,840
I don't think so. To be really honest.

568
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,240
Well, I think that in you're seeing

569
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,800
a thousand deals a year or something.

570
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,000
Then you're going to find a good combination.

571
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,560
Right?

572
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,160
But we have the opportunity to be very

573
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,120
selective and entrepreneurs do as well.

574
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,480
And, you know, we look for the fit.

575
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,720
You look for the fit. I love that.

576
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,640
Okay. Talk to me a little bit

577
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
about a women in tech.

578
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,680
Women entrepreneurs.

579
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,800
I mean, you started long before 2020.

580
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,280
When you know things are looking up.

581
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,280
Talk to me a little bit about this.

582
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,800
What you noticed over the past few decades

583
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,160
as you're in technology?

584
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,760
You know, I don't have the luxury

585
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,080
of living so long and knowing

586
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,240
and seeing these things progress.

587
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,240
I'm coming into a time in the workplace

588
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,800
where, you know, as far as I'm

589
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,280
concerned, everything is equal.

590
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,040
And every VC that I talk to

591
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,200
has at least one woman who is a

592
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,120
founding member or a managing director.

593
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,000
So, talk to me a little bit about

594
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,880
what's happened over these past years.

595
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,080
Well, sure, I'd be happy to.

596
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,800
So, when I wrote the first white paper,

597
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,180
which was back in 2010.

598
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,160
So, 10 years ago, it's kind of remarkable.

599
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,160
I was never intending to invest

600
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,320
only in women.

601
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:48,880
But, I did know having been a

602
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,880
woman founder, CEO of myself,

603
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,720
that there were challenges.

604
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,120
That there were some obstacles

605
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,800
that women faced and other

606
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,920
minority groups as well,

607
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,160
not just women.

608
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
That the typical white male did not.

609
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,320
And I thought it was important

610
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,240
to try and understand.

611
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,040
Are those obstacles

612
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,040
self-imposed in some cases?

613
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,200
Are they pipeline issues?

614
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,760
As many people always have suggested.

615
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,200
What are the obstacles?

616
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,920
And also try to understand.

617
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,720
Okay, for those women

618
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,240
who did receive funding,

619
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,280
who managed to somehow get to that level.

620
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,320
What happened?

621
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,520
How well did they perform?

622
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,200
Was there that the same level

623
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,440
of performance as men?

624
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,640
Or less or more.

625
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,080
But what did it look like?

626
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,000
So, while I was fundraising and doing

627
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,960
investments and everything else,

628
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,480
I decided to do some

629
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,320
research around all of this.

630
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,800
I ended up enlisting the help of two

631
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,600
master's students at Carnegie Mellon,

632
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,920
my alma matter, to work with me on it.

633
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,560
And I ended up reading, I think,

634
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,800
something in the range of

635
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,160
600 existing research reports.

636
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,560
Talking to the professors

637
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,880
that were doing the research on campuses

638
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,200
around the country.

639
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,380
Talking to VCs.

640
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,720
Talking to women who had founded

641
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,600
venture capital firms previously.

642
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,440
That had in most cases,

643
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,080
Frankly not been successful,

644
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,280
because they were funds

645
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,640
that focused exclusively on women.

646
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,320
And I was trying

647
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,280
to understand what happened.

648
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,520
What why didn't that work?

649
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,560
What was wrong with the strategies?

650
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,880
And I learned so much.

651
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,960
It was pretty overwhelming.

652
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,360
A lot of that is in that paper.

653
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,600
If anyone wants to find it,

654
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,480
they can go to our website and just go

655
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,440
to Illuminate Ventures or just

656
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,680
illuminate.com/whitepaper

657
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,120
That's a great domain, by the way.

658
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,960
But you know it was a labor of love

659
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,280
And one where after I did the research,

660
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,360
just to be honest,

661
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,440
I was never planning to write a white paper.

662
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,280
But I wanted the data for myself.

663
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,480
I put it into a PowerPoint.

664
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,880
I shared it with my advisory board

665
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,540
at one of our advisory meetings.

666
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,120
And they said,

667
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,640
"Well, you have to write white paper."

668
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,640
And I said,

669
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,960
"I don't write white papers."

670
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,800
And anyway, they insisted I finally did it

671
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,040
with some help from these students.

672
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,760
And we had a phenomenal reaction.

673
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,560
Because what we found

674
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,040
and what we discussed was

675
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,880
the really high performance

676
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,040
of women when they were funded.

677
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,960
And the fact that so many more than ever

678
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,720
in the past were qualified,

679
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,680
had the entrepreneurial skills,

680
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,280
had the entrepreneurial desire,

681
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,200
had the right training, education,

682
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,960
work experience, everything.

683
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,960
And yet many of them

684
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,200
not only were being funded,

685
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,560
but when they were it was

686
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,440
at a smaller level of funding

687
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,400
[--] table.

688
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,880
So, it was an interesting paper.

689
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,200
Then following that

690
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,960
just 18 months ago,

691
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,760
we published a new report

692
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,440
that focused more on gender differences

693
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,200
in existing entrepreneurs

694
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,040
and venture capitalists.

695
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,360
And we're right now finishing up

696
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,360
our latest in this series, I guess.

697
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,520
Now, and I guess I can call it a series

698
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,920
of unintentional white papers

699
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,600
that is focused on students.

700
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,040
And in particular on MBA students.

701
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,000
And how they think about

702
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,920
entrepreneurship and venture capital.

703
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,200
Fascinating. Fascinating.

704
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,720
And I mean. And really papers

705
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,400
are sort of considered a hallmark

706
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,320
of understanding the gender

707
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,880
differences in entrepreneurship

708
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,280
and in venture capital.

709
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,560
Cindy, you know, I'd love to get

710
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,760
your take on entrepreneurship right.

711
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,760
Before we started this talk,

712
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,880
you're starting to tell me how awesome it is

713
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,520
to be able to be a young

714
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,800
entrepreneur today.

715
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,080
You know, it makes me feel good

716
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,600
about me being a young entrepreneur.

717
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,120
So here's the reality.

718
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,240
It doesn't matter if you're young or old

719
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,480
from a chronological perspective,

720
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,360
but if you are thinking entrepreneurially,

721
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,600
if you are creative,

722
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,400
if you are innovative, if you dare

723
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,760
to take your ideas and put them

724
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,840
in front of other people

725
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,880
and risk rejection,

726
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,320
risk them saying no,

727
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,000
and gather that feedback and build

728
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,920
something meaningful from it.

729
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,840
I'm not sure there's any better feeling

730
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,320
that you can possibly have.

731
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,080
It could stretch if

732
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,480
it's just so rewarding.

733
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,320
It's such an exciting thing to be

734
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,440
able to be an entrepreneur.

735
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,440
So, before you mentioned the word chutzpah.

736
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,200
Which is quite possibly

737
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
my favorite word ever.

738
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:22,440
Talk to me a little bit about chutzpah.

739
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
What does that mean to you and why?

740
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,280
Why is that an integral part

741
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,360
of being an entrepreneur?

742
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,440
Yeah. So, some time ago,

743
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,240
someone asked me,

744
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,880
"What do you think is

745
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,040
the definition of an entrepreneur?"

746
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,080
And I said, "I think it's someone who's

747
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,760
able to look at insurmountable obstacles

748
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,400
and choose consciously,

749
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,160
knowingly to ignore them."

750
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,400
Not stupidly.

751
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,960
Not pretending they don't exist.

752
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,600
But choosing to ignore them.

753
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,000
That's chutzpah.

754
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,520
That's being able to have

755
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,480
the ability to put your concerns

756
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,360
and worries aside and

757
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,760
take the opportunity to put yourself

758
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,560
if you are, you're really

759
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,640
putting yourself out there.

760
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,040
Your ego is out there.

761
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,360
Because it's your idea.

762
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,080
It's your product.

763
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,960
And your energy that's going into it.

764
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,080
And then being a great leader,

765
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,000
a strong enough leader to convey that

766
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,800
to a whole team of people.

767
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,200
The best people you can find

768
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,640
that want to follow you

769
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,480
in meeting that ambition

770
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,480
and reaching that goal.

771
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,640
That's more than  that want.

772
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,080
That's leadership as well.

773
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,920
But it's the combination of those two.

774
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,640
I think that it can make

775
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,600
for a great entrepreneur.

776
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,080
100%. I keep hearing that it takes

777
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,960
somebody that crazy

778
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,320
to forego a good salary

779
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
as an engineer or something.

780
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,880
And decide to go and run after

781
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,840
a crazy idea that could possibly

782
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,920
make the world a better place

783
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,640
or change the world

784
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,120
or move the needle in some way.

785
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,920
But having to go through those obstacles

786
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,480
and more than just ignoring it.

787
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,680
But actually tackling them

788
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,040
and getting excited every day,

789
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,840
tackling them.

790
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,120
I often talk to my wonderful girlfriend

791
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,480
about how excited we are

792
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,560
that we have people telling us that

793
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,720
what we're doing is not going

794
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,880
to succeed or it's just not right.

795
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,800
And we get excited by this feeling that,

796
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,440
yes, we're going against the crowd,

797
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,200
we're going against what people are

798
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,000
telling us, because we innately believe

799
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,040
that what we're doing is right.

800
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,160
And that it's going to work.

801
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,680
And even if we fail, that's okay.

802
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,520
Because  just that excitement

803
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,400
and the energy we get all along

804
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,560
is just worth everything.

805
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,640
Cindy, what are you really passionate about?

806
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,200
Today, you wake up every day,

807
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,720
you look at companies, you're investing,

808
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,040
you're doing all sorts of things.

809
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,240
What what are you really excited about?

810
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,360
Oh, my gosh.

811
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,760
You know, I think that

812
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,560
I love the work that I do.

813
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,560
If it doesn't show, I don't know

814
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,720
how to explain it.

815
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,120
But I love the fact that we have

816
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,800
the opportunity to build

817
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,600
long term relationships with founders.

818
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
I mentioned two of the founders

819
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,840
and I sat on their boards for 10 years.

820
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,100
It's a remarkable opportunity

821
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,240
when I stood with the others

822
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,080
on the floor of the

823
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,360
New York Stock Exchange.

824
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,520
And my founders,

825
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,520
the original founders of Xactly.

826
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,240
Were up there on the balcony

827
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,280
and ringing the bell.

828
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,560
I started crying.

829
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,080
You know, I started crying

830
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,080
and somebody said to me,

831
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,640
"Well, is it the money?"

832
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,160
"No, for god-sake".

833
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,120
But it is definitely not that old.

834
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,840
You've seen them when they just had

835
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,520
a slide deck and an MVP, right?

836
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,200
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

837
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,400
No, I'm excited and passionate about

838
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,760
a number of different things in life.

839
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,960
And in some of it is how our lives are

840
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,840
changing because of the crisis

841
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,240
that everyone is facing today.

842
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,880
The innovation that's coming out of that.

843
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,920
The heartfelt sympathy

844
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,200
that people are able to share

845
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,200
and express and help one another.

846
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,400
In times like this,

847
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,560
you see the best side of people.

848
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,440
Right.

849
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,240
And how they step up.

850
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,480
I just think that  work will change.

851
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,640
How we all work,

852
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,600
how we all learn is changing so rapidly.

853
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,480
Because of limitations being

854
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,680
and restrictions being placed

855
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,520
on how we can work together.

856
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,240
And I think the innovation that is going

857
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,160
to come out of this is going to be--

858
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,280
I can't wait. You bring so much optimism into it.

859
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,840
I love it.

860
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Cindy, right before we go,

861
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,400
I want to thank you again for your time.

862
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,360
It's so generous of you.

863
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,680
You have so much going on.

864
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,440
And really, I really appreciate

865
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,440
you taking the time for this.

866
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,160
I need three words that you

867
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,520
would use to describe yourself.

868
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,800
And then I'm going to let you continue

869
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,040
running this awesome venture.

870
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,720
Wow. I would say entrepreneurial.

871
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,720
I would say I could use two words for this.

872
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,040
High integrity.

873
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,480
Okay.

874
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,880
And yeah, Passionate.

875
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,360
I love it.

876
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,320
Entrepreneurial,

877
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,280
High Integrity, and Passionate

878
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,440
Cindy, toda raba.

879
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,160
Thank you very much.

880
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,680
I didn't, I want to also talk about J-Ventures

881
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,120
that we're both a part of.

882
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,800
We didn't get to that.

883
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,840
But I look forward to learning with you

884
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,120
on our work through the fund.

885
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,520
And thank you for all the support.

886
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,480
And yeah, good luck with everything.

887
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,520
And I can't wait to see this optimism play

888
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,160
out in real life in the years to come.

889
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,440
Thank you so much, Michael.

890
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,040
Take care.

891
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,640
Bye bye.

892
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,120
Bye bye.
