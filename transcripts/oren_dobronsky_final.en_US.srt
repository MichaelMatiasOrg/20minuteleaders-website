1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,440
I'm just a person that was very lucky,

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,840
I did something that I liked

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,240
since I was a kid,

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,840
which was writing code.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,440
Getting into computers at the time

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,500
it wasn't a popular thing.

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,560
Oren Dobronsky, thank you so much

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,040
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,600
How are you?

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,400
Very good.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,680
Thank you for having me.

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,040
I am blushing.

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,760
I'm a huge, huge fan,

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,000
I have to say.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,520
I'm a huge fan on several fronts.

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,600
First of all, your Hummus helped me

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,080
get through many final exams

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,120
at Stanford, not just me,

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,440
but about all of my dorm.

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,360
It's Stanford's favorite restaurant,

21
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,480
I have no doubt.

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,080
The second thing is the direct flight

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,680
between San Francisco and Tel Aviv.

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,040
I believe you had quite an important hand

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,440
in making that happen.

26
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,720
So, my father, myself

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,040
and everybody else,

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,600
really thank you for that.

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,760
But more importantly than that,

30
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,440
Oren, you have an incredible,

31
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,560
streamline of entrepreneurship endeavors

32
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,400
that you've had.

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,960
Most recently, an incredible unclear,

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,080
given that I can't wait to hear about it.

35
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,920
But also a pretty prominent,

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,720
now TV persona,

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,280
through the Sharks in Israel.

38
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,177
So, wow.

39
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:39,400
Oren, how did you do so many things?

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't know.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,120
I guess I can't help it.

42
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,000
That's the right answer.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,840
I love that answer.

44
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,320
But tell me how you started.

45
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,520
You went to Mamram, and from there

46
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,440
how does this happen?

47
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:57,240
So, I consider myself very lucky.

48
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,000
That's the bottom line.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,040
I'm just the person that was very lucky.

50
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,440
I did something that I liked

51
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,840
since I was a kid

52
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,400
which was writing code.

53
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,000
Getting into computers at the time

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,200
it wasn't a popular thing.

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,800
My parents used to shout at me,

56
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:13,169
you know,

57
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,440
"Why don't you go out and play?"

58
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,400
And I said, "I just love it."

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,120
And I used to play a lot

60
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,240
with my computer.

61
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,560
And then it was very natural

62
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,560
for me to go to Mamram.

63
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,200
And when I was leading the army,

64
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,360
it was '96

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,440
and I really had this vision

66
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,000
of what the Internet can happen.

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,880
And back then, in Israel in '96,

68
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,920
very few people thought, you know,

69
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,120
about the upcoming revolution.

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,440
So, I started my first startup in '97

71
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,120
just because I felt that again.

72
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,120
This was like I had

73
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,400
to do something about it

74
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,120
and I created my first startup.

75
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,920
It was the first Craigslist.

76
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,600
I didn't even know about Craigslist,

77
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,960
but I still get to Craigslist in Israel.

78
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
A bulletin board.

79
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,120
And I mean, the year wasn't,

80
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,760
the market wasn't ready.

81
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,600
So, I had to close that the year later.

82
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,840
It was a big heartache.

83
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,480
And thank God I had a girlfriend

84
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,400
at the time who told me,

85
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,600
"You must work on the second one."

86
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,120
I told her, "You know,

87
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,200
it doesn't work this Internet."

88
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,160
And she said, "No no no. You must do it."

89
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,000
And so I started my second one.

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,440
And then I basically hit the jackpot.

91
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,360
I came up with a concept of toolbar.

92
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,280
And I hold the patent over toolbar

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,480
and that became history.

94
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,200
Unbelievable, literally everywhere.

95
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,520
That is Hotbar, correct?

96
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,880
Right. That was Hotbar.

97
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,840
We had an estimate that

98
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,640
we had like one

99
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,080
in every four computers in the world

100
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,280
had our toolbar installed, at the time.

101
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,640
That is just unbelievable.

102
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,360
Talk to me a little bit

103
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,880
about that resilience

104
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,120
of being a young entrepreneur.

105
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,480
Your first startup fails.

106
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,880
With the inspiration and motivation

107
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,520
from your girlfriend,

108
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,680
you moved on to the second startup

109
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,480
and it skyrockets to the point

110
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,680
where you are literally in a quarter

111
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,240
of the computers in the world.

112
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,600
What was that transition like?

113
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,160
How do you fathom that transition?

114
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,160
Well, you know, even then,

115
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,160
the mindset, it was so,

116
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,040
everything was so,

117
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
every day there were new things.

118
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,320
People didn't really know.

119
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,320
They would know today.

120
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,760
It's funny today when you start stuff,

121
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,320
there's so much material

122
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,040
to read about and to learn,

123
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,160
you know, even when you went to Stanford.

124
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,600
At the time there was nothing.

125
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,880
Anyone who did anything

126
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,040
in the Internet space,

127
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,320
it was all discovered.

128
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,280
It was a totally like the Wild West.

129
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,360
I think about it this way.

130
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,160
You know, we needed to invent,

131
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,720
you know, from the methodology.

132
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,200
And what are you going to do,

133
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,440
how you're going to do, there were no tools.

134
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,440
You need to build everything yourself.

135
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,880
Obviously, there was no cloud.

136
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,640
So, we needed really to figure out

137
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,320
what we were doing.

138
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,600
And, you know,

139
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,040
it's also the market's modification.

140
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,960
Then 2000 came and everything tanked.

141
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,200
And we needed to, you know, stay afloat

142
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,560
in a very difficult year.

143
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,000
Unbelievable.

144
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:04,160
Different times.

145
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,240
I have to say that, you know,

146
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,960
I spent five years in 8200

147
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,560
which was a phenomenal experience.

148
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,120
I'm sure a very similar

149
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,680
to the experience in Mamram.

150
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,840
And then, going to California

151
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,280
and seeing what's happening there,

152
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,720
literally every corner at Stanford

153
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,880
there's a class teaching you

154
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,400
how to start a startup.

155
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Every kid that walks

156
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,560
on campus is thinking,

157
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,000
"What am I going to do?"

158
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,160
In 97, 98, that wasn't the case.

159
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,920
You didn't have a class

160
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,280
in every corner helping you,

161
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,040
which is amazing.

162
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,600
No, there was nothing.

163
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,000
You know, I needed to explain that

164
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,920
what I'm doing is

165
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,240
I'm a computers company

166
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,760
in a special field called the Internet.

167
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,540
It was kind of a subset

168
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,320
of being in computers.

169
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,160
Wow.

170
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,600
That is just unbelievable.

171
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,560
I want to fast forward

172
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,320
the journey a little bit.

173
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,040
And I want to make sure

174
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,960
that we very soon get clear,

175
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,760
giving them all

176
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,320
your most recent endeavor.

177
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,800
But you have two stints along the way

178
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,240
that are very irregular

179
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,760
for the average, you know,

180
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,640
Silicon Valley entrepreneur.

181
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
The first one is something

182
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,360
that we can all thank you

183
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,240
for allowing us to travel back and forth

184
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,080
to Tel Aviv and San Francisco.

185
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,560
That is a startup by itself,

186
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,720
it sounds like, because

187
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,600
that was quite a journey.

188
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,560
Tell me a little bit about that.

189
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,880
Well, that was totally

190
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,800
an irrational thing to do, right?

191
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,160
So, I was living in the valley.

192
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,040
I moved to the valley in 2008.

193
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,600
So, first I moved to New York in 2000.

194
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,320
I lived there eight years.

195
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,280
I already sold my startup Hotbar.

196
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,120
I exited, I made some money

197
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,200
and I had another one.

198
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,880
That one also went well.

199
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,120
And then I moved to the Valley.

200
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,800
And then living in the Valley,

201
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,000
having to take this daunting flight

202
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,280
to Tel Aviv once or twice a year

203
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,040
when you need to stop somewhere

204
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,480
and collect your luggage

205
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,840
and move it to a different terminal

206
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,760
and all kind of crazy shit,

207
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,520
I just said, "This cannot be the case."

208
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,760
So, you know, I contacted United

209
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,533
and they said to me,

210
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:57,418
"You know, Oren,

211
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:58,880
there's just not enough demand."

212
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,880
And I said, "Well, this is not possible."

213
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,200
There are so many startups here,

214
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,160
so many Israelis.

215
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,000
But not just Israel here,

216
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,004
there are so many American startups

217
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:09,920
that are, you know,

218
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,800
I have a location in Israel

219
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,360
that need to fly people

220
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,560
from Google to phase,

221
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,880
I mean, anyone I knew.

222
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,480
Yes.

223
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,560
There's a big, big center in Tel Aviv.

224
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,040
And so, I decided to do a petition.

225
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,840
And, you know,

226
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,800
and about 10,000 people

227
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,080
signed a petition committing to flight

228
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,000
of 36,000 flights roundtrip tickets.

229
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,520
And with that, I basically came back

230
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,592
to all the airlines and I said,

231
00:07:33,593 --> 00:07:35,559
"Guys, there is a demand."

232
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,480
And there was a phase there, you know,

233
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,960
that United just got tired of me.

234
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,400
And, you know, it's funny because

235
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,000
after they launch that direct line,

236
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,840
two months after that

237
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,720
they had this national convention,

238
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,080
they have an annual convention

239
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,640
with all the managers meeting United.

240
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,880
And the guy who is in charge

241
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,880
on route planning is going to the stage

242
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,920
and he says the following.

243
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,160
He said, "I don't know how these Israelis

244
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,520
remodel all our algorithms.

245
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,240
But this is the number one flight

246
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,960
in our network

247
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,840
and we couldn't see it."

248
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,440
That is really unique.

249
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,840
How do you explain that?

250
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,240
Is it that did they fly under the radar?

251
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,320
You know, look, I think that they look

252
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,040
at Tel Aviv and San Francisco

253
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,800
as two random locations

254
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,120
like Boston and Rome, okay?.

255
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,560
I told them, "No, these are two tech hubs

256
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,840
that the companies who work

257
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,600
in these places

258
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,600
will definitely use your business class."

259
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:36,760
Yes.

260
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,120
"If they have an option to fly direct,

261
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,960
they will not fly in direct

262
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,160
because of price."

263
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,720
Yes.

264
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,320
You know, maybe it's my fault

265
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,440
that the prices went so high.

266
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,000
But United said, you know, "Okay.

267
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,760
So, let's have a bigger business class.

268
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,400
Let's charge a lot of money."

269
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,440
And guess what?

270
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,600
People just were willing to pay any price

271
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,640
to have a direct flight

272
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,480
instead of wasting a day.

273
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,000
I mean, it's a very simple market.

274
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,680
Right?

275
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,200
On one hand, when you have

276
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,880
the regular flight,

277
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,520
you're applying to the larger market,

278
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,480
most of it is business and leisure.

279
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,120
But here, not many people

280
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,160
take a vacation to San Francisco.

281
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,400
Right?

282
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,480
So, I think that's just [--].

283
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,680
But that was minor compared

284
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,000
to the innovative nature

285
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,640
of Oren's Hummus

286
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,400
that I you know,

287
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,440
I have to say, Oren,

288
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,640
I'm in Tel Aviv,

289
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
I ate hummus here every day.

290
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,720
And somehow I find myself

291
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,240
missing your restaurant.

292
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,498
No, no way.

293
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:36,480
You are too sweet.

294
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,480
But you introduced the Jaffa.

295
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:39,840
Right?

296
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,000
The off menu Jaffa dish

297
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,840
that one of the waiters told me about.

298
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,320
And since then...

299
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,200
So, tell me a little bit about

300
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,840
why start a Hummus Restaurant?

301
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,880
So again, you know,

302
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,040
as an entrepreneur,

303
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,520
you just can't help it.

304
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,680
But you always see

305
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,880
what needs to be done.

306
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,160
You always say, what is missing,

307
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,600
what can be done with this,

308
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,920
what is not, you know.

309
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,800
Here I have to admit

310
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,960
that not only that

311
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,520
I saw how much it was missing,

312
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,400
I myself, miss hummus.

313
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:09,880
Yes.

314
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,040
I used to go eat hummus before

315
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,600
I board a plane to go to San Francisco.

316
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,480
And when I come back,

317
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,764
I used the first thing to do

318
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:17,360
is to go to eat hummus.

319
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,760
Yes.

320
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,280
And I said, "Let's have a place

321
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,640
basically for the Israelis."

322
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,080
I didn't think about it too much.

323
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,760
I just wanted a place for us.

324
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,120
And my wife thought at the time

325
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,920
that I was a little bit crazy.

326
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,448
And I told her,

327
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:32,240
"You know, Nancy, you're right.

328
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,760
Consider it like a midlife crisis.

329
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,240
But we'll have a place."

330
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,720
And she has experience.

331
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,080
I was very lucky to have her

332
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,880
because she has a restaurant experience.

333
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,640
And so, she helped me open it

334
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,360
in the beginning because

335
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,240
I didn't know what I was doing.

336
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,280
And the one thing

337
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,520
that I insisted on is that

338
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,480
you will keep it like

339
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,720
the best quality possible.

340
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,280
We were not aiming into profitability.

341
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,960
We say we are going to,

342
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,920
let me give you an example.

343
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,440
So, from day one,

344
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,800
we would import the grains themselves

345
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,360
from Israel in a boat.

346
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,160
Think about it.

347
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,200
The grain needs to go halfway

348
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,680
around the world to be on your plate.

349
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,920
And the tahini,

350
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,640
we bought the whole pita machine

351
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,160
because there were

352
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,560
no decent pitas in the dairy.

353
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,120
So, it was really,

354
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,560
how would I say it,

355
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,320
it was not a financial project,

356
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,800
it was a project

357
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,720
that comes from the soul.

358
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,360
And, you know,

359
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,160
some people are saying

360
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,680
that this is the recipe for success.

361
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,520
I don't know if that's true.

362
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,040
But it really came from a place

363
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,920
to do the best,

364
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,640
the best food I can do.

365
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,000
My only goal was, I mean,

366
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,280
other than financing it,

367
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,640
my only goal was to make sure

368
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,240
that the taste is the way I remember it.

369
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,320
To be as authentic, because some people

370
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,120
along the way suggested, maybe we should

371
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,200
adjust it to the American palate.

372
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
And I said, "No way.

373
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,400
We are going to do it exactly

374
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,960
the way it is in Israel."

375
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,960
And I think that's where the charm is.

376
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,040
That suddenly there was

377
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,200
such different taste,

378
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,280
such a different experience.

379
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,640
I mean, when we opened,

380
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,080
we had Americans who came in.

381
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,280
And the fact that you use your hand

382
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,493
to rip the pita and scoop it,

383
00:12:04,494 --> 00:12:06,400
it was like mind blowing.

384
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,919
A hummus eating guy.

385
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,320
We explain how to do it

386
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,440
because people didn't know how to do it.

387
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,240
And you know, somebody told me

388
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,640
this is the best place for a date.

389
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,560
You just come and you share and you

390
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,680
I mean, it's unique.

391
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,600
So, when you say that you miss it,

392
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
when you're in Israel, you know,

393
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,640
in Israel there is a hummus

394
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,560
in every corner,.

395
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,480
And people are like diehard fans

396
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,320
of one hummus

397
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,480
and they will never step

398
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,000
into another hummus.

399
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,040
California was a desert.

400
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,560
I mean, if they were anywhere near

401
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,520
a decent hummus,

402
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,200
I wouldn't have the opened.

403
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,720
The only reason I opened is that

404
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,760
I couldn't find anything decent.

405
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,600
And Oren, of course,

406
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,320
I have to mention

407
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,360
that the missing ingredient

408
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,320
from everything that you mentioned

409
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,280
which exists there,

410
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,120
is when you walk down

411
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,240
University Avenue or Castro,

412
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,500
you hear Shlomo Artzi

413
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:52,280
coming from one of the restaurants

414
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,040
and that just warms the heart

415
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,600
of every Israeli that walks there.

416
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,040
But Oren, we have to...

417
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,360
And that's totally my wife.

418
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,440
That's totally my wife.

419
00:12:59,440 --> 00:12:59,942
Yes.

420
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:00,880
That's genius.

421
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,560
We have to fast forward

422
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,800
because we only have 20 minutes.

423
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,960
We have to still talk about Clear Giving.

424
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,800
And we completely skipped

425
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,480
over the fact that

426
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,040
you're a huge TV celebrity

427
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,920
in Israel now, known as a startup guru,

428
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,680
investing as part of the Shark Tank show.

429
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,760
But we'll leave that

430
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,960
for another discussion.

431
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,000
Oren, after all of that

432
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,960
incredible success and endeavors,

433
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,800
which I have to say

434
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,200
that the most inspirational part for me

435
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,240
is not the toolbar

436
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
and it's not the startup in '97,

437
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,800
it's about this lifelong mentality

438
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,200
of being an entrepreneur.

439
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,440
And it's about your motivation to go

440
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,760
and fix whatever you see

441
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,560
happening around you.

442
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,840
And I think that is just so incredible.

443
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,800
And that's a mentality

444
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
that I wish for myself,

445
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,520
I wish for all my friends,

446
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,400
for everybody that's surrounding me.

447
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,680
So, I really want to thank you for that.

448
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,280
Talk to me a little bit

449
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,160
about Clear Giving.

450
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,800
What happened that you said,

451
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,040
"Now I want to make a social impact."?

452
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,280
Yeah.

453
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,880
So, Clear Giving is actually

454
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,760
a continuation of a project

455
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,480
that I did for many years before that.

456
00:13:57,481 --> 00:13:59,600
So, when I had some money to give

457
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,400
and I really started to struggle

458
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,800
where I'm giving it.

459
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,880
I felt that just giving it

460
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,998
to the first random nonprofit

461
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:10,440
is just not the right thing.

462
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,200
You need to treat it with respect

463
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,280
as if this is, you know,

464
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,680
you are serious about

465
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,120
getting it to the right places.

466
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,840
And none of the non-profits,

467
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,960
none of the organizations

468
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,480
that I worked with

469
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
offered the level of transparency

470
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,640
that I would use to, I usually

471
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,240
give a big sum of money

472
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,320
but you don't really know

473
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,787
what happened to it.

474
00:14:29,788 --> 00:14:31,000
You don't know what impact,

475
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:32,160
you don't know where it goes,

476
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,520
you have no control of where it go.

477
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,880
So, for many years

478
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,880
I used to employ an individual

479
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,320
who used to find me families in need

480
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,520
that I could support them directly.

481
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,502
So, after doing that

482
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,680
for more than 10 years,

483
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,240
I basically decided, you know what?

484
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,160
How about taking it to the next level.

485
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,320
How about productizing it

486
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,080
and basically doing, again,

487
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,280
what I wished would be,

488
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,880
what I started giving,

489
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,000
which is basically

490
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,840
someone who could build for you

491
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,600
a portfolio of families.

492
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,200
And that's basically

493
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,400
how I started Clear Giving.

494
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,947
I basically said,

495
00:15:09,948 --> 00:15:12,040
"We will make a website

496
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,280
where we first of all,

497
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,640
we screen families

498
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,040
that need support in Israel.

499
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,080
We get them all from the HaRevaha,

500
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,520
which is the social services in Israel,

501
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,480
then governmental social services.

502
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,680
We screen them,

503
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,040
they need to pass certain criteria

504
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,280
before we upload a certain profile

505
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,480
of them on the website.

506
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,560
Obviously, it's anonymous.

507
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,240
You cannot know who they are,

508
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,720
but you get to know their story.

509
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,320
So, you as a donor,

510
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,720
you can go into the website

511
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,080
and choose families you want to support.

512
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,480
Amazing.

513
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,760
We initially report it

514
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,520
like adopt a family.

515
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,280
Some people felt it's like too much.

516
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,680
So we said, let's call it Clear Giving.

517
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,640
Another big feature

518
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,600
other than knowing

519
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:53,280
who you're giving the money is that

520
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,640
we set a 100% of the donation

521
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,800
goes to the family.

522
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,200
So, we separate the operation,

523
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,200
of course, we have dedicated donors

524
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,360
for operational cost.

525
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,560
At this point, it's me.

526
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,240
But in the future,

527
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
it can be other people as well.

528
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,400
But the vast majority of donors,

529
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,680
if they give a dollar,

530
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,840
then the dollar goes to a needy family.

531
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,440
So, that gives you a feeling

532
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,840
that you are not, we are not,

533
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,720
there's no conflict of interest.

534
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,520
I like to say,

535
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,160
it's the biggest bang for the buck.

536
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,880
You give $10,000,

537
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,840
$10,000 go to families

538
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,920
and there's nothing being taken out.

539
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,280
I have to ask because first of all,

540
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,280
regarding that last point,

541
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,080
it's fascinating because,

542
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,320
because when they do take a cut

543
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,920
or a margin from the donation

544
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,720
then obviously, the more they market

545
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,440
the more they make.

546
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,200
And then there's a conflict of interest.

547
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,040
But I have to ask about the distinction.

548
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,200
A lot of the nonprofits

549
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,040
that I'm aware of

550
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,480
and a lot of the organizations,

551
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,440
you give them the money

552
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,120
and they promise

553
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,440
that they'll disseminate it

554
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,960
to those that are in need.

555
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,600
But you don't have that story.

556
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,680
You're missing that individuality aspect.

557
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,600
And when you're mentioning

558
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,160
that you're telling

559
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,240
the story of a family,

560
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,800
even though it's anonymous,

561
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,240
I feel like I'm giving to that family.

562
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,920
So, tell me about that business model.

563
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,120
You picked it.

564
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,080
So, I want to make that,

565
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,080
I want to give the benefit

566
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,720
to you as a donor

567
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,560
that you know who you helped.

568
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,520
It's like if it wasn't for you,

569
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,400
they did not had food on the table.

570
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:20,760
Right?

571
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,720
I mean, this is literally,

572
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,320
you chose them, you picked them

573
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,840
and your money is going to them

574
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,200
and you get reports to the last cent.

575
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,040
You know where it went.

576
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,400
Another important thing that you said

577
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:33,800
is that we believe

578
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,960
that helping people in need

579
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,520
is something that, you know,

580
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,800
people who need food,

581
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,120
people who need clothing,

582
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,000
people who need basic, basic things.

583
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,280
I want to help them.

584
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,800
You know, there are many,

585
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,680
many nonprofits today that help

586
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,200
on a higher magnitude.

587
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,440
We will build a big matnas.

588
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,200
You know what a matnas is?

589
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,080
A big school.

590
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,560
Like a community center, yeah.

591
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,200
We will change poverty.

592
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,000
You know what?

593
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,280
I think it's important.

594
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,520
But I think it's also important

595
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,680
to help the poor person

596
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,560
who cannot feed his kids

597
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,600
or who cannot buy his daughter,

598
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,600
you know, [--]

599
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:17,280
because he doesn't have money.

600
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,880
And just think about the drama

601
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,360
that these people are living in.

602
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,000
If you can help them get something,

603
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,680
you know, so basic

604
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,800
that we all are taking for granted.

605
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,000
I think that's a big mitzvah.

606
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,200
I think people need to think

607
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,960
about it when they do philanthropy,

608
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,920
they need to say, you know,

609
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,920
I have big, big goals

610
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,880
and I have, you know,

611
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,680
immediate help that I can offer.

612
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,760
I like to say it's like,

613
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,560
you're planning a financial portfolio.

614
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,600
You sometimes invest in high risk,

615
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,040
you go to startups

616
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,600
and you go to make equity,

617
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,320
but you also have bonds

618
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,920
and with low risk products.

619
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,880
And the same thing here.

620
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
You need to think long term,

621
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,800
but you also need to get fish

622
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,520
to the poor person standing at your door

623
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,701
and is asking. You cannot tell him,

624
00:19:05,702 --> 00:19:07,400
"Oh, no, I'm going to send the kid

625
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,320
to the university."

626
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,560
You know, that's nice.

627
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,760
I'm going to give a tuition

628
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,080
to a kid like a scholarship.

629
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,200
Yeah, that's nice.

630
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,640
But what about the young people

631
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,120
who need the help right now?

632
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,440
So, I like to think

633
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,000
that this is the solution.

634
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,160
What we started doing

635
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,120
and I think it's valuable to say

636
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,640
is that we started as really offering

637
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,360
this service to anyone

638
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,240
with a credit card

639
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,240
so people could, you know,

640
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,560
give $10 or five dollar,

641
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,080
whatever they want, they can give.

642
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,280
And it's a monthly thing

643
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,920
that they support a family.

644
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,320
By the way,

645
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,160
whenever we get to $200 a month,

646
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,720
that's what we want to raise per family

647
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,040
then that family goes off the site

648
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,560
and now we will help another family.

649
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,080
Wow.

650
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,600
So, that's the quota.

651
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,000
But my point is that

652
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,120
we recently started doing basically

653
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,680
a service to bigger donors.

654
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,760
So, people who want to give me

655
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,960
$10,000 or $20,000.

656
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,920
What we said is that we will build

657
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,080
a portfolio for them,

658
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,840
think about it as a managed portfolio.

659
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,200
Yes. I was just about to ask about that.

660
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,000
So, if $200 a month, right,

661
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,720
times 12, it's 24.

662
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,760
For $2400 a year,

663
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,160
you can basically take

664
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,560
a family in need,

665
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,400
families with very difficult stories

666
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,320
and basically move them

667
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,720
into a totally different place.

668
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,880
It might not change them.

669
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,920
It's not that they are not poor anymore,

670
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,520
but you take so much drama,

671
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,640
bad drama out of their life.

672
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,800
You give them support,

673
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,480
you give them the basics.

674
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,280
Now, whatever extra money they have

675
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,840
they use in buying something.

676
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,320
They buy new shoes for their kids

677
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,000
or stuff like that.

678
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,640
But if you may even think about it,

679
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,360
for almost 11,000, right?

680
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,600
10,800, you help five families a year.

681
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,280
I don't think other nonprofits

682
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,760
can offer something like that

683
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,360
because usually, again,

684
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,720
when you think long term,

685
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,000
then you need to invest more.

686
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,720
When it takes longer

687
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
and then things are more costly.

688
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,920
But here, for $11,000,

689
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,720
you basically can help five families.

690
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,800
And this is what we are aiming now.

691
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,640
We are aiming now

692
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,040
for people who basically come to me

693
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,040
and say, look,

694
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,320
I'm giving you a budget,

695
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,920
think about like a bank account,

696
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,440
I'm giving you a budget,

697
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,240
and you will build me

698
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,600
a portfolio of families.

699
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,800
These families will stay with them.

700
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,720
We are not going to switch them.

701
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,320
They will be your families.

702
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
We will update you

703
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,800
what's going on with them.

704
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,560
From time to time

705
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,520
they might write you a letter.

706
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,920
But basically you will know

707
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,720
that you support these families.

708
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,920
I think that's remarkable.

709
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,560
When you mentioned

710
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,542
about the families

711
00:21:44,543 --> 00:21:45,720
not being poor anymore,

712
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,440
but at least

713
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,160
they'll give them comfort.

714
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,680
I'm a huge fan

715
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,040
of the pyramid of Maslow.

716
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,960
I remember when I learned about it,

717
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,880
first in middle school,

718
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,640
I understood it so well.

719
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,280
I was going through

720
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,600
a heartache with a girlfriend

721
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,480
and I couldn't function

722
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,240
because I didn't have

723
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,200
that baseline field.

724
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,520
And I can only imagine

725
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,120
how difficult it is for a family.

726
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,360
And I'm very privileged to come

727
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,480
from a family where I never had

728
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,160
to worry about food on the table.

729
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,600
But by giving them the food,

730
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,760
by giving them some comfort,

731
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,613
you're allowing them

732
00:22:14,614 --> 00:22:15,680
to think more critically

733
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,600
about how they can then

734
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,000
improve on the other things.

735
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,040
And it's like you're a rolling ball.

736
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,320
It's a spiral.

737
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,560
I love it.

738
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,480
Think about the shame

739
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,200
of the parents that need to look

740
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,280
into the kid's eyes

741
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,400
when they cannot afford

742
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,680
buying them shoes.

743
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,000
You know, when I think about it,

744
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,240
I'm starting to howl.

745
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,360
I'm tearing up right now.

746
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,160
Because I have kids.

747
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,960
If I would have a situation

748
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,000
that I could not afford

749
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,960
buying them something

750
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,600
that is pretty much basic

751
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,200
that other kids have,

752
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,240
you know, this is a terrible situation.

753
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,240
So, the $200 a month

754
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,920
is as small as it sounds,

755
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,120
makes a huge difference

756
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,800
for these families.

757
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,040
Unfortunately, there are so many families

758
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,560
here in Israel, now, especially you know,

759
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,600
we didn't speak about that,

760
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,920
but now with the corona, you know,

761
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,760
I returned to Israel for a year.

762
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,960
I took a gap year now

763
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,840
in August for a year

764
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,200
after 20 years in the States.

765
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,960
And, you know, I was shocked.

766
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,520
The corona literally took families

767
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,760
who were already in a good place

768
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,040
and put them in a bad place.

769
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,520
Those that were in a bad place

770
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,560
it put them in a place

771
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,640
that you cannot imagine.

772
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,200
So, the level of poverty,

773
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,160
usually you don't see it,

774
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,040
because when you stay Tel Aviv,

775
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,400
Tel Aviv is like another country.

776
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,560
It's like the Silicon Valley.

777
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,600
It's like the state of Tel Aviv, yeah.

778
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,120
Right.

779
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,640
When you move out of Tel Aviv

780
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,440
and you go Holon and Lod and Ramla,

781
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,360
you know, all these places,

782
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,400
you cannot believe

783
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,240
what stories we found.

784
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,080
And again, I would say, you know,

785
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,760
if now is a time,

786
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,000
if there was ever a time

787
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,680
to give to help people directly,

788
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,440
it's now.

789
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,366
Now it's not a time to say,

790
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:51,880
You know what?

791
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,680
I'm going to save for your tuition.

792
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,640
I'm going to change

793
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,040
the education system.

794
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,320
Now is the time to just give.

795
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,800
Oren, thank you for all the amazing work

796
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,720
that you're doing.

797
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,480
You are touching literally

798
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,680
so many lives before this,

799
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,480
after this, during this.

800
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,320
Thank you very, very much.

801
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,640
Before we leave,

802
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,360
I have to ask you

803
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,440
the most important question,

804
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,760
which is three words

805
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,040
that you would use to describe yourself.

806
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,960
Oh, my goodness.

807
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,640
Well, I'm definitely entrepreneur.

808
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,080
Yeah.

809
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,440
But I would like to say

810
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,240
that I'm a world benefactor.

811
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,040
That's my goal in life.

812
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,040
A world benefactor.

813
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,560
Yeah.

814
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,640
I want to make this world

815
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,800
a better on many levels.

816
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,760
That's how I see myself.

817
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,440
Entrepreneur, world benefactor.

818
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:40,840
I love it.

819
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,960
Oren, toda raba.

820
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,360
Thank you very, very much.

821
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,200
Okay my friend.

822
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,480
Thank you for having me.

823
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,080
Of course.

824
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:52,200
Thank you for having me.
