1
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,160
Shiran Melamdovsky Somech, how are you?

2
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,760
I'm great, thank you.

3
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,360
And it's finally it's great to meet you.

4
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,840
Really good to be here. First of all,

5
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,360
did I say your name correctly?

6
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,360
Actually, yes.

7
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,960
Okay. So, all the rehearsing

8
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,360
that we did before this paid off.

9
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,440
Shiran, I can't wait for this conversation

10
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,960
because we have so much to talk about.

11
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,120
From your work at DRIVE TLV

12
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,160
to the two communities

13
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,960
that you are a part of,

14
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,440
Yazamiyot and Saleet.

15
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,320
Really incredible incredible missions.

16
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,760
And I'd love to talk

17
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,280
both about your day job,

18
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,440
but also your night job,

19
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,800
as you referred to it.

20
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,040
And some of the impact

21
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,360
that you're making on women

22
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,800
in Israel and the world.

23
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,360
So, maybe you can take me back

24
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,560
a little bit and give me a little bit

25
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,480
of an overview of what you do

26
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,520
at DRIVE TLV and then transition into

27
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,440
what are these two other communities

28
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,920
that you are a big part of?

29
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,400
Sure. So, DRIVE, its Innovation Center

30
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,640
for smart mobility.

31
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,000
And we are working together

32
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,240
with eight different partners.

33
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,320
And what is so unique with our partner

34
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,360
that they create

35
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,160
a wide range of domains.

36
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,760
So, today, many people think

37
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,240
that mobility is related to automotive.

38
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,880
Maybe kind of a very narrow world.

39
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,440
But it's much much more than that.

40
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,920
And today, we are working

41
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,320
with our partners.

42
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,160
So many different domain.

43
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,600
It could be infrastructure,

44
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,280
industry 4.0, smart cities,

45
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,640
logistic and delivery.

46
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,160
Even marketing, insurance, and finance.

47
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,360
So, it's amazing.

48
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,720
So, what is the end mission?

49
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,520
For us, so, we are really focus and drive

50
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,160
to create competitive advantage

51
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,800
both for our partners and our startup.

52
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,320
And what does that tangibly mean?

53
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,000
So, you're sitting in Tel Aviv

54
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,800
and what does the organization actually do

55
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,760
with these partnerships

56
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,600
and with these startups?

57
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,120
So, in the first phase,

58
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,920
we create a friction with as many startup

59
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,920
in the Israeli ecosystem.

60
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,000
We know how to create a value

61
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,120
for them from day one.

62
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,440
It could be a business opportunity

63
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,560
with our partners

64
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,680
using our connection, knowledge.

65
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,880
We have a lot of workshop and meetup.

66
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,720
We bring people

67
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,000
from all over the world and so on.

68
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,360
Also, we agnostic to the startup stage.

69
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,920
Could be early stage, mature,

70
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,360
round A, round B,

71
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,040
and even public companies.

72
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,600
So, in the second phase,

73
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,840
we find some promising startups

74
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,480
and we offer them to sit

75
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,880
in our core workspace for free

76
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,640
for a few months.

77
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,640
We consider this mature due diligence.

78
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,480
So, they have the opportunity

79
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,920
to learn about us,

80
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,040
about our value and so on.

81
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,760
And then for us to learn about them.

82
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,600
About the team.

83
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,480
Their progress, their technology.

84
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,400
And the third

85
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,600
and the most important phase for them,

86
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,960
we have the Fastlane program.

87
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,280
This is a program that I'm running.

88
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,280
It's drive commercialization program.

89
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,360
And it's relevant

90
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,640
for cutting edge technology startups

91
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,080
and also, startups that relevant

92
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,760
to our partners needs.

93
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,840
And we are working pretty intense

94
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,520
with those startup during five months.

95
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,480
And we assist them to meet the market.

96
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,920
Because usually they are coming to us

97
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,840
when they are very familiar

98
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,680
with the technology,

99
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,680
but not too familiar with the market.

100
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,960
A true Israeli story.

101
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,080
Exactly.

102
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,360
And we have this process with the startup.

103
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,200
Also we have a parallel process

104
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,120
with the partner.

105
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,720
We work in pretty tight

106
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,440
with our partners as well.

107
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,480
We assist them to adapt

108
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,480
and adjust the technology.

109
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,600
And also, of course,

110
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,760
that we're working with a startup

111
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,440
and the corporate,

112
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,560
now we need to create the touch point

113
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,520
between those two.

114
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,320
And it's usually in regular days

115
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,560
before the covid.

116
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,200
So, we have a real show.

117
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,880
We visit our partner in the headquarter

118
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,360
in Japan, Sweden, and the US.

119
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
Yes, it was super amazing.

120
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,240
And we had a presentation

121
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,880
in front of the top executive,

122
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,840
the CEO, the CTO, top engineer.

123
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,520
And we create a consensus

124
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,560
to drive in the startup.

125
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,520
And after we build this consensus,

126
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:16,960
everyone say,

127
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,040
"Wow. Drive is so amazing."

128
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,400
"And such a great startup."

129
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,960
"We have to work with those."

130
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,760
Now, after the CEO say that,

131
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,520
so then it's easier to move forward

132
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,560
to the next stage.

133
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,800
And then we create a B2B

134
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,480
with relevant business unit.

135
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,920
And they're talking about the technology

136
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,360
and how to move forward.

137
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,200
And I mean, it's the collaboration.

138
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,160
So, very very strategic partnerships

139
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,480
between the start ups and helping them

140
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,440
get into this very mature market already.

141
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,920
With very very big players

142
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,520
that I'm guessing,

143
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,880
getting contracts with them

144
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,600
and getting them to come on board

145
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,960
is very very difficult.

146
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,880
And having somebody like DRIVE TLV

147
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,080
facilitate that communication

148
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,760
and that strategy

149
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,560
is something that I'm sure

150
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,760
it's very very helpful.

151
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,840
Before I ask the why,

152
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,520
I want to ask the how.

153
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,880
What is happening with mobility right now

154
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,200
in the world or in Israel

155
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,880
that you're seeing

156
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,320
some of the trends in 2020?

157
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,240
Obviously we have autonomous vehicles,

158
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,200
we have electric vehicles.

159
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,280
But what in the world of mobility

160
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,640
are we still missing

161
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,080
some interesting opportunities

162
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,760
that we hope to see soon?

163
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,440
So first, I will consider

164
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,080
to what's happened in those days.

165
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,080
We cannot ignore to the covid effect.

166
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,920
So, first of all,

167
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,840
the automotive is booming.

168
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,640
But probably only if you're a Tesla.

169
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,120
So, for the other companies,

170
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,720
there is a big slowdown

171
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,320
in the manufacture and sales as well.

172
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,840
Less attention to innovation

173
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,640
and working with startups also,

174
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,920
in some of the time.

175
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,800
However, we can recognize also

176
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,760
new opportunities.

177
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,840
Like there is a new normal.

178
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,760
We are not sure what is going to stay

179
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,560
and how the world is going to look like.

180
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,000
But for now, there is a new normal.

181
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,880
There is new challenges.

182
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,360
We call it opportunity.

183
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,800
The cliche for making lemonade.

184
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,560
But this is what we're trying to do.

185
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,320
We are trying to be proactive.

186
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,760
So, we recognize, for example,

187
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,120
that many fleets.

188
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,640
That there is a car that is just

189
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,200
standing there in a parking lot

190
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,920
with no use at all.

191
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,120
And we approach our startup

192
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,520
and we assist them

193
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,880
to adjust their technology.

194
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,640
So, for example,

195
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,200
we have a solar panel company

196
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,960
that now it protect the vehicle batteries.

197
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,040
And also, we recognize

198
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,920
there is the rental car, for example.

199
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,480
There is no use for a rental car today.

200
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,160
However, there is increase

201
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,080
in the demand for delivery.

202
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,960
So, we took this rental car together

203
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,320
with the startup and the system to use it

204
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,360
as a delivery vehicle.

205
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,360
And utilization of the fleet.

206
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,640
So, it's amazing.

207
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,000
For those startup

208
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,440
it's amazing opportunity.

209
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,320
Very very cool.

210
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,400
Okay. So, I want to make sure

211
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,120
that we leave enough time

212
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,960
to talk about the two other organizations,

213
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,440
which are just wonderful.

214
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,040
Talk to me a little bit

215
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,360
about Yazamiyot.

216
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,320
This great community of females

217
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,560
that are working together

218
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,040
to promote women in entrepreneurship

219
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,160
and leadership positions.

220
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,280
But tell me a little bit about,

221
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,440
first of all, Yazamiyot,

222
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,760
for the English speakers

223
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,600
means female entrepreneurs.

224
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,360
That's the name of the community?

225
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,080
Exactly.

226
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,520
It's not exactly international name.

227
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,760
But this is exactly

228
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,640
the meaning of Yazamiyot.

229
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,080
And it was established,

230
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,360
I think it was the first

231
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,600
and the leading community in Israel

232
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
for propelling forward female entrepreneur

233
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,720
in the high tech industry.

234
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,000
And establish like more than 10 years ago

235
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,640
by a serial entrepreneur

236
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,480
named Hilla Ovil-Brenner.

237
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,520
And what we do in Yazamiyot,

238
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,880
it's actually give

239
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,240
the female entrepreneur hooks.

240
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,760
We want to be productive

241
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,280
and to assist them.

242
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,960
To give them relevant tools

243
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,440
so they can build successful companies.

244
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,080
And we collaborate

245
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,520
with leading IT company

246
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,960
as the Google campus.

247
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,000
We create Google campus for moms

248
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,040
for our family maternity leave.

249
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,320
That instead of stay at home

250
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,880
and have a massage courses for babies,

251
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,960
they have the opportunity

252
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,680
to get some relevant tool

253
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,640
and follow their dream

254
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,480
and change the world.

255
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,720
And I remember that,

256
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,240
I think it was five or six years ago,

257
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,120
I came to the Google campus offices

258
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,520
back in the old location.

259
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,960
And I remember I walk in

260
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,640
and there is like 20, 30 moms

261
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,440
with their babies

262
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,040
sitting there on Google campus

263
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,360
working together.

264
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,840
It was incredible.

265
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,760
It was really incredible.

266
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,800
So, this is an amazing initiative.

267
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,000
And it also became worldwide in Google.

268
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,600
And now actually we finished

269
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,800
another accelerated program

270
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,480
for more mature startups.

271
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,840
This time there's no babies.

272
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,200
Just the entrepreneurs themselves.

273
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,680
And together with Microsoft.

274
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,160
And it was very interesting program.

275
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,560
This time we did it during the covid.

276
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,800
And so, we did mostly in during Zoom

277
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,360
or Google Meet, the Microsoft platform.

278
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,520
And I think that it was

279
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,840
a very very interesting period.

280
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,800
Because the female founder,

281
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,040
specifically in those time,

282
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,840
need a guidance and assistance.

283
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,880
Right.

284
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,320
So, talk to me a little bit more broadly

285
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
about female entrepreneurship in Israel.

286
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
Something that you're now very familiar

287
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,280
and involved with.

288
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,120
What are some of the trends

289
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,720
that you've seen

290
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,240
over the past decade or so,

291
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,040
and perhaps where are we today

292
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,640
and what do we hope to become

293
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,600
in a few years as Yazamiyot

294
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,240
is trying to move the needle there?

295
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,920
I think this is a very important question.

296
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,320
Today we are talking about

297
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,160
like 7% of female founder.

298
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,440
It's very low number.

299
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,480
Just a quick reminder,

300
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,440
we have 51% of the population.

301
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,320
And for my experience,

302
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,440
I recognize two main reason for that.

303
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,800
The first one, the gates to Silicon Valley

304
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,800
and to successful startup company,

305
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,000
start with have a funding.

306
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,480
So, usually startup in the early stage,

307
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,280
don't really have a product.

308
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,160
Don't really have a product market fit.

309
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,600
Don't have income or revenue or whatever.

310
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,040
So, usually the investment

311
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,840
is based on chemistry

312
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,040
between the founders

313
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,360
and the venture capital.

314
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,440
And because of there are mostly

315
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,920
9% of the investor are male,

316
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,560
so it's a bit more difficult for female

317
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:10,000
to build this trust and those chemistry

318
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,080
and to get funding.

319
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,320
Interesting.

320
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,760
So, just to recap.

321
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,280
What you're saying is

322
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,440
one thing that you've noticed

323
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,920
is because, the beginning of the cycle

324
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
is that the majority

325
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,760
of the venture capital partners

326
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,000
in Israel are males,

327
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,680
and they make their pre-seed

328
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,920
or seed investments primarily based

329
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,000
on the chemistry with the team.

330
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,720
Because there's still very little,

331
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,640
perhaps annual revenue.

332
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,480
It's still there is not necessarily

333
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,240
product market fit.

334
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,760
So, they based it off of chemistry.

335
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,840
And just traditionally,

336
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,080
usually male investors

337
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,240
will have a better chemistry

338
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,320
with male founders.

339
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,760
So, it sounds like what you're saying is

340
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,800
that the touchpoint is not just

341
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,560
in getting more female entrepreneurs,

342
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,600
it's actually also getting more

343
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,280
female venture capital partners

344
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,040
who will help drive that investment

345
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,900
into female founders, right?

346
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,090
Did I get that right?

347
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,520
Yes, totally.

348
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,280
You've got it right.

349
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
And this is one of the biggest barrier

350
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,440
for a female founder.

351
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,680
And the second one is also related

352
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,000
to what you just mentioned.

353
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,280
It's women don't have

354
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,320
enough technical skills.

355
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,400
There's not enough technical female.

356
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,080
So, also I heard some theory,

357
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,320
call it, the leaking pipe.

358
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,160
So, you start in the high school,

359
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,000
it's a 50% boys and girls

360
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,600
study the mathematics

361
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,280
and computer science and so on.

362
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,440
But then in the army,

363
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,400
and then in the university,

364
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,040
the number become much lower.

365
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,200
And then the IT company.

366
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,920
And this is reflect both

367
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,480
about the skills itself.

368
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,600
So, it's very important to have

369
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,680
this technical skills

370
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,400
in the technical companies.

371
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,470
And also in the network.

372
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,500
Women usually,

373
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,720
don't have the right network.

374
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,600
Yeah.

375
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,040
Women usually

376
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,040
don't have the right network

377
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,600
because they weren't part

378
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,800
of the technical units in the army.

379
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,520
And they usually

380
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,800
don't have been in the university

381
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:17,680
in the relevant studies and so on.

382
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Okay. So, the first thing we talked about

383
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,480
was this idea that we need more women

384
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,800
in venture capital positions

385
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,760
to make those decisions.

386
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,040
To invest in female entrepreneurs.

387
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,640
But inherently, we also need

388
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,600
more female technical founders

389
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,320
that are coming in from this background

390
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,160
and they don't fall within the pipeline.

391
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,000
And I actually had

392
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,280
a few fascinating conversations

393
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,920
with female engineers on this show.

394
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,080
And very similarly,

395
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,400
they were talking about

396
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,840
this decision making process

397
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,680
in high school, especially in Israel,

398
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,160
you have to choose your path

399
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,240
right already in high school,

400
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,280
where you're going to be studying.

401
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,640
And so, that's a very interesting junction

402
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,840
before you go into the military.

403
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,880
And I want to leave enough time

404
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,760
to talk about Saleet.

405
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,480
Because it's a very, while it's similar,

406
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,720
I mean, the idea about helping females,

407
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,360
but it's on a very different level.

408
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,600
So, talk to me a little bit

409
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,440
about what Saleet is

410
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,480
and what you're trying to do over there.

411
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,160
So, Saleet is a nonprofit organization.

412
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,080
Power Tel Aviv municipality

413
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,560
and the government.

414
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,920
And it's to help women in prostitution.

415
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,680
So, it's kind of different phase.

416
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,320
Very different.

417
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,840
Yes. In my life.

418
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,240
And it was very important to me to,

419
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,560
this is a topic that were very important

420
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,000
to me to assist those female

421
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,640
that not equal and part of the society.

422
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,840
So, in Saleet,  in the first phase,

423
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,720
the first detect the prostitution,

424
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,600
the prostitute,

425
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,880
and then give them a shelter.

426
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,520
Like a kind of a protection,

427
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,360
basic and sleep.

428
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,880
Sleep over, grab some food,

429
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,440
hiding from their pimp or whatever.

430
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,920
And then after they build the trust,

431
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,880
they can offer them rehabilitation.

432
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,840
To offer them to some treatment.

433
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,560
It could be a psychologist treatment

434
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:24,280
or a personal group therapy.

435
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,520
And also give them some tool

436
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:32,520
to be integrate in the society again.

437
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,200
So, how do you even get started

438
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,920
with waking up and saying,

439
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,600
now I want to work on a nonprofit

440
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,120
that will help women in prostitution?

441
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,440
There's so many different issues.

442
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,840
I mean, what drove you specifically

443
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,480
to this issue that you said,

444
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,040
"Okay, this is what I want to start

445
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,320
spending my nights on."

446
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,280
Because you obviously have

447
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,960
a full time job.

448
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,000
You're very involve with Yazamiyot

449
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,000
yet you're taking on this another project,

450
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,480
which technically sounds like

451
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,400
another full time job.

452
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,760
This is very good question,

453
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,920
I'm not sure I have the answer for that.

454
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,600
I was always attract to assist women

455
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,200
in human trafficking,

456
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
sex trafficking and so on.

457
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,960
I never had the opportunity to do it.

458
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,480
I just read about this

459
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,840
and I was thinking how awful it is.

460
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,040
And now the world

461
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,880
and the society can make this happen.

462
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,040
Right.

463
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,680
And while I finish my degree

464
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,360
and I have some free time,

465
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,680
like people looking for hobbies,

466
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,440
so, I calls it my hobby.

467
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,240
Wow. That's whats inspiring.

468
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,720
Instead of going dancing

469
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,240
or do something else,

470
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,440
it was very interesting.

471
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,520
And this topic, I think,

472
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,800
is super important.

473
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,760
Because like those female,

474
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,720
and this is also something

475
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,840
I understand along the way.

476
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,600
In the beginning,

477
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,040
my state of mind was,

478
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,640
we should do the prostitution to be legal.

479
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,640
To make it legal.

480
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,920
To give them the rights.

481
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,480
They should pay fees and so on.

482
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,360
But after a while,

483
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,640
after I was more involved in Saleet

484
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,120
and understand what's happened

485
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,840
to those women, so, I understand that

486
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,960
they don't do it from choice.

487
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,000
It's not like a freedom

488
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,480
of the occupation stuff.

489
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,080
It's not.

490
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,160
Like most of them,

491
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,840
90% in their childhood,

492
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,000
they have like a self abuse.

493
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,640
So, it's not like the easy choice

494
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,680
to make easy money.

495
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,200
It's far away from that.

496
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,440
And I think society need to do something.

497
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,400
And to assist these women.

498
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,760
So, what is the vision

499
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,320
that you are seeing

500
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,400
in the coming years with Saleet?

501
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,400
The vision.

502
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,120
I wish that they're talking a lot

503
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,960
about a new regulation in this field.

504
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,120
And it's something that

505
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,680
it's look positive.

506
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,200
They're talking about it for a while.

507
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,480
And also it looks positive

508
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,200
for a while as well.

509
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,560
But there is no sustainable government,

510
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,880
so, it's very difficult.

511
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,600
But the regulation, I think is right.

512
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,120
And this is what we are talking about.

513
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:27,400
It's to prevent the prostitution at all.

514
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,600
Right.

515
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,400
But from the customer side,

516
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,880
to cut the demand.

517
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,320
If there is no demand,

518
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,560
so, no be prostitutes.

519
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,800
Right. Classic economics.

520
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,280
Yes.

521
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:42,960
That makes sense.

522
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,840
Well, I just want to say that,

523
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,520
it sounds like all the programs

524
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,480
that you're running along,

525
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,680
in your night job,

526
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,520
right after your day job with DRIVE TLV,

527
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,040
it's completely inspiring.

528
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,320
And I'm getting personally

529
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,080
a lot of inspiration.

530
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,480
Because I think that at the end,

531
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,360
you can feel the energy

532
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,600
that you're bringing to these programs

533
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,000
and saying that your hobby

534
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,400
is to help women in prostitution

535
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,740
through a nonprofit that you're making

536
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,680
a scalable impact,

537
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,080
I think that's wonderful and I think

538
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,120
it's such an incredible hobby to have.

539
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,200
Even if you can call it even a hobby.

540
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,480
But before we leave,

541
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,000
I have to ask you

542
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,760
the most important question.

543
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,800
I need three words that you would use

544
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
to describe yourself.

545
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,080
Oh, tough one.

546
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,400
The hardest one.

547
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,280
Yeah. I think the first one is stamina.

548
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,960
Empowerment.

549
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,440
And people person.

550
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,200
Stamina, empowerment and people person.

551
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,320
Shiran, thank you again

552
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,280
for your generous time and effort.

553
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,800
It sounds like you're doing

554
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,000
really really fantastic things.

555
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,760
And I can't wait to see the impact

556
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,520
of both Yazamiyot and Saleet.

557
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,960
And to continue following your journey

558
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,840
in DRIVE TLV.

559
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,760
Thank you very much.

560
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,560
Thank you for the opportunity. Bye.

561
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,440
Take care.
