1
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,832
All right. Yael Shemer, thank you so much

2
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,499
for joining us on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,766
Thank you so much for having me Michael.

4
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:58,466
So, you're originally from Israel

5
00:14:58,467 --> 00:14:59,532
but you live in New York.

6
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:00,832
And now you're visiting Israel.

7
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,732
Yeah. That's right. I'm here for a month,

8
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:05,532
but I moved to New York six months ago.

9
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:06,832
And you moved there

10
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,232
for your start of TULU. Right?

11
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:08,966
Yeah.

12
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:10,332
Okay. So, what is TULU?

13
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,232
Talk to me about TULU.

14
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:14,499
So, TULU is an on-demand rental service.

15
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,432
We provide smart rental units

16
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:18,299
in apartment buildings, in neighborhoods,

17
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,132
in offices

18
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:21,099
where tenants can practically download

19
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,799
our app and rent whatever they want

20
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,966
for as long as they want.

21
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:26,932
So, we work mainly in residential buildings

22
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:27,766
in Manhattan.

23
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:29,932
We also have 10 locations in Tel Aviv.

24
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:31,399
Some student dorms.

25
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,066
We're now launching a location with Wix

26
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,799
so employees can actually rent something

27
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,566
after work and return it the next day

28
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:40,399
or for the weekend.

29
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,766
But really our mission is to re-shape the way

30
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:45,199
people use and consume stuff.

31
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,566
Okay. So, it's the idea of renting stuff.

32
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:49,899
What stuff are we talking about?

33
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,566
Is this like, it's vacuum cleaners and bicycles?

34
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:56,166
Is that the sort of stuff we're talking about?

35
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:59,299
So, it's a wide range from what you really need,

36
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,532
and what you kind of want but don't need.

37
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:04,332
Which also makes sense to rent.

38
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,099
So, we have a Dyson vacuum cleaner,

39
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,599
and we have a ladder, and a drill,

40
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,532
and a projector, and a steamer.

41
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,632
So, the essential stuff for a home.

42
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:13,099
So, household items,

43
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,266
but we also have fun stuff

44
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:16,166
like a VR headset, a drone.

45
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:18,132
- Wow.
- Sewing machine.

46
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:19,966
And we just have a very eclectic,

47
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,832
So, we always have the essential product

48
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,032
that we know people are using

49
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:24,966
and then we also try pop-up products

50
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:27,766
and pasta maker, mixer, air fryer.

51
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:30,266
So Yael, one of the key things that

52
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:32,432
I think unifies all of these things together

53
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:33,832
is that all of them break.

54
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,632
Right? All of them are bound to break

55
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:36,899
at a ... point.

56
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,866
So, how does that even work?

57
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,566
So, you go to these apartment buildings.

58
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:41,266
I'm guessing you have a room

59
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:42,999
where you're putting in all of these supplies.

60
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,732
And then something breaks.

61
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:45,666
What do you do?

62
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:48,599
So, actually when our users break something,

63
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,332
we just ask them to tell us,

64
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,432
and then we'll repair it.

65
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:55,332
So, our philosophy is to really try

66
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,599
to repair everything we can

67
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,466
or to provide products that are higher quality.

68
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:01,832
And we know from our users also that

69
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,132
they rather use a really good projector

70
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:07,232
but they're buying a bad one from online

71
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:09,132
because they don't want to spend the money.

72
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:10,999
So, our stuff don't really break.

73
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,132
And if someone hurt it on purpose,

74
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,932
which almost never happens,

75
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:17,999
we kindly just take it

76
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,132
and take a deep breath

77
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:20,399
and understand that it's a part of

78
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,466
educating a market.

79
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:22,599
Right. So, okay.

80
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,999
So, Yael, educating a market,

81
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,566
talk to me a little bit about this

82
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:29,032
this idea and it's not very conventional.

83
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:30,999
This idea that you have an apartment building

84
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,032
and you have all the tenants share

85
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:34,799
the same Dyson vacuum cleaner.

86
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,932
So, where did this come from

87
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,132
and what are the different challenges

88
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:41,599
in educating the market for that?

89
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,432
So actually TULU is,

90
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:45,866
ever since we started TULU

91
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:47,432
my co-founder Yishai and I

92
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,199
and we have an amazing team

93
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,532
here in Israel and in New York,

94
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:52,932
people are telling us this is such a simple idea.

95
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:54,932
And it had to happen.

96
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:56,766
But what we’re doing that is different,

97
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:59,899
is we're providing access to a really

98
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,066
highly maintained household items.

99
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:04,666
We're choosing our products carefully,

100
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,466
and it's very aesthetic and it's a product.

101
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:09,032
It's something that really wants

102
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:10,432
to be a part of your lifestyle

103
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:12,199
and create a habit in your lifestyle.

104
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,432
So, starting from our design

105
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:16,532
and our data and our marketing,

106
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,466
everything, it's just like a brand

107
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:19,466
but in your building and

108
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:20,866
it's just like a gym or a pool.

109
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,266
It's an amenity you have.

110
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,932
Something you can use in your life in the building,

111
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:27,966
but also, now, as I told you,

112
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,032
we have other ideas regarding the workplace

113
00:18:31,033 --> 00:18:32,499
and regarding neighborhoods

114
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,399
around sharing stuff.

115
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,866
But the sharing idea is not new like you said.

116
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,699
People tried doing peer to peer rentals.

117
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,732
And what we figure is that

118
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:44,532
the access economy is just,

119
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:46,699
just makes more sense. Yeah.

120
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,966
So, I mean the whole idea

121
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:49,966
of sharing goes back all the way

122
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:51,266
to the days of the Kibbutz, right?

123
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:53,199
When the inception of Israel and they said,

124
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,732
"Okay. Let's share a lawnmower

125
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,666
across the whole Kibbutz.

126
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,399
We don't need each person to buy their own"

127
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,566
But this also speaks pretty close to what

128
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:03,199
I believe WeWork started few years ago

129
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,132
called WeLive. Right?

130
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:06,866
And others have picked up on this idea

131
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:08,366
of shared living spaces

132
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:09,832
and the fact that the new generation

133
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,032
might be more open to the idea

134
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:14,732
of reducing privacy,

135
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:17,032
more sharing, more social interactions.

136
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:18,266
So, where does that fit in

137
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:21,432
to this whole genre and paradigm?

138
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:24,699
So, actually the meaning of TULU is

139
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,499
originated from TULU, which are

140
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,032
Chinese buildings in China.

141
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,832
It's a very very beautiful big structure

142
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,566
with micro-apartments that the center of,

143
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:38,266
it's a circular structure that the center of it

144
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:39,732
has the kitchen, the living room.

145
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:42,132
Of course, it doesn’t look like what we know.

146
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,566
But the idea is to really leverage

147
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:47,966
spaces in a building where the individual

148
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:50,632
doesn’t need to own or to have stuff

149
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:52,999
that can be shared with more people

150
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,166
and then therefore use space better.

151
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:57,632
So, my co-founder is an architect,

152
00:19:57,633 --> 00:20:00,132
and I come from an environmental background.

153
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,599
And together we really,

154
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,432
we were really thinking hard about

155
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:06,632
how come cities,

156
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:09,599
people live so close to one another

157
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,066
and there are much progress happening

158
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:13,732
in the world of rentals and co-living

159
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:14,532
like you said

160
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:17,366
but there's still no integration

161
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:18,499
in your daily life.

162
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,032
If you really wanna do sharing,

163
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:22,232
you have to move to a WeLive

164
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:23,932
or you have to move to a,

165
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:29,166
kind of prestige living situation

166
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,932
where people living in buildings right now,

167
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,299
they can still do that.

168
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,966
So as you said, our demographic

169
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:38,532
is mostly young professionals.

170
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:40,066
People that are,

171
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:42,532
showed on research that are more adaptive,

172
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:45,932
and early adaptors to the idea of access.

173
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:47,832
And differently than a Kibbutz,

174
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,132
we're using an app,

175
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:50,732
and a state of mind

176
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,266
where, in a Kibbutz

177
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:54,499
if you borrowed something from someone

178
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,599
and they brought it back dirty,

179
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,699
you would get upset

180
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,499
and you would talk to them.

181
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,699
But now it's through us.

182
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,832
And we take care of everything.

183
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,032
And you pay us.

184
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:07,799
So, in a sense it's a bit easier on the user

185
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,832
to go through the mental process

186
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,866
of trusting a company to do that for you,

187
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:13,999
but we are trying to create

188
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,766
a sense of ownership in a rental world

189
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:18,999
where, if you took your vacuum cleaner,

190
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,499
you'd wanna return it clean

191
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,532
because you know your neighbors

192
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:22,499
are also relying on that.

193
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,832
Right. And I think

194
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,399
it does also speak to a difference on

195
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,466
I imagine living in an apartment building

196
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:30,232
and then my neighbor above my floor

197
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:30,999
comes and says, "Hey Michael,

198
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,599
can I borrow your vacuum cleaner?

199
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,532
Mine just broke."

200
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:34,699
I'd say, "Yeah, of course.

201
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,466
Here just grab it."

202
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:37,066
If somebody on the street

203
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:38,232
comes up and says to me,

204
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:39,399
"Hey Michael can I come up with you

205
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,332
to take your vacuum cleaner

206
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,199
and I'll bring it back."

207
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,866
Probably not so much. Right?

208
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:45,466
So, I think there is some psychological

209
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:47,699
acceptance in the fact that you're sharing

210
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,199
this living building or office with other people.

211
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,266
And automatically,

212
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:53,232
you have something in common

213
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:55,699
that you're more apt to share these

214
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,299
more personal things. Right?

215
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,466
Vacuum cleaners are going on all these

216
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:03,166
different surfaces. But how big does it get?

217
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:05,232
So, how many of these items

218
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:06,566
do you actually offer

219
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:07,932
to apartment buildings or offices?

220
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:12,399
Each TULU unit has around 25 products.

221
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,099
It really depends on the size of the building.

222
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,832
So, our average size is around 200 units.

223
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:21,566
And then we just decide how many Dyson,

224
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:23,532
how many scooters, how many printers,

225
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:23,999
how many -

226
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,066
200 units means 200 apartments

227
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:26,832
in a building?

228
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,032
Apartments in a building.
- Wow

229
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:31,266
And then our matrix as a company

230
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,032
is to really engage with as many people

231
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:34,499
as possible within a building

232
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,766
or within a neighborhood.

233
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:38,499
So, we also work with Tel Aviv Municipality

234
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,499
and we have this really cute

235
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,132
TULU room in the middle of

236
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:44,699
Nordau Boulevard where we install

237
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,399
the smart glass door. And it's 24/7.

238
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,766
And people can just come pick up

239
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:52,632
folded chairs, a tent, bike carrier,

240
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:54,032
sewing machine, different stuff.

241
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:56,966
And then we also calculate how many

242
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:58,466
potential users we can get.

243
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:01,732
And that's kinda how we think about it.

244
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:03,466
That's incredible.

245
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,666
And that is in Tel Aviv?

246
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:07,232
That's in Tel Aviv. We have three locations.

247
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:08,732
We have Tel Aviv, New York and New Jersey.

248
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:11,099
And hopefully in the upcoming year

249
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,999
we'll have some more surprises.

250
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,466
Incredible. So, what are the biggest challenges

251
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:18,966
approaching this type of new market?

252
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:20,432
You are creating a new market

253
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:21,232
in a sense. Right?

254
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,066
I mean, this is something that's very different,

255
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:26,766
and I imagine that there is a generation gap

256
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:29,466
on accepting this new customer behavior.

257
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:30,499
Is there?

258
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,732
There is a generation gap.

259
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:34,766
You know, we've discovered that our

260
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:35,499
product market fit

261
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,932
is actually in student dorms.

262
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:39,699
People that are temporary. The renters. They're also -

263
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,032
- I would love to use it in my dorm. Yeah.

264
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:44,499
Yeah, you know, and the average millennial

265
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,932
moves every three years.

266
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:48,532
So, if you're buying crap you don’t need

267
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:49,899
you also have to carry it with you

268
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,732
to the next apartment

269
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:52,632
because you're cheap. You're young.

270
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:53,399
You're a student.

271
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,699
You don’t wanna buy new stuff.

272
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,332
That's exactly my issue now.

273
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,066
I wanna come back to Israel for six months

274
00:23:58,067 --> 00:23:58,699
with my girlfriend,

275
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,366
but I have all this crap from Stanford

276
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:01,666
that I don’t know where to put.

277
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:04,699
So, friends have graciously offered to host it,

278
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,999
but it sucks because this is stuff that I don’t need

279
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,966
it's probably gonna go bad

280
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:09,632
in six months sitting away.

281
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:11,632
I wish I could just let somebody else use it

282
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,299
and then come back and rent it out again

283
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,832
for my next year.

284
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,266
Of course. It makes perfect sense.

285
00:24:16,267 --> 00:24:19,132
Yeah. So, it's really a state of mind

286
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:21,099
we're, as young professionals

287
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,299
or millennials, our lifestyle

288
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,999
are more dynamic. We're moving a lot.

289
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,632
We don’t wanna be attached to things.

290
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,799
Some people like myself, I'm a minimalist.

291
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,799
I really love the joy of not having stuff.

292
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,099
It really brings me joy.

293
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,499
But other people also find a practicality of it.

294
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,832
And I think, when we designed TULU

295
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:40,299
our mission was to say,

296
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,199
"If we create something

297
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,499
that's good enough, that's reliable,

298
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,499
that rents you a suitcase when you need it

299
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,399
and you can rely on it,

300
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,899
that's how we're going to start

301
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,966
educating a market"

302
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:50,966
So, that's really

303
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:53,366
The first stage of TULU was for us

304
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,032
to understand that the building,

305
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:56,899
we have to be in a good location

306
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,732
in the building. We have to be in the lobby.

307
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:01,532
We have to be in an accessible place in the building.

308
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,699
It can't just be the roof or the basement

309
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,766
for us to really engage with the tenants.

310
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:09,266
But also, to really learn about our demographic.

311
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:12,099
It's people who move a lot, work a lot,

312
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,099
the weekends are the strongest usually.

313
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,132
So, that's how you educate a market.

314
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:17,932
You have to really be obsessed with

315
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,632
integrating in their lifestyle.

316
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:23,766
Right. So, then what are you learning about

317
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:25,832
your customer behavior over this past time?

318
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:26,866
What are some of the things

319
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:28,566
that you've been observing?

320
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:31,932
Some stuff are easier to rent than others.

321
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:34,366
Some like bikes and scooters

322
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,699
and a vacuum cleaner, and some brands.

323
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,299
Those are easier right?

324
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,199
Yeah.

325
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,232
Okay.

326
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:41,199
What did you say?

327
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,966
Those are the easier kinds.

328
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:44,866
The bicycles and the vacuum cleaners.

329
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:46,532
Yeah 'cause it's already happening

330
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:48,699
and you really just don’t wanna buy

331
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,599
something that cost a thousand dollars.

332
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,232
And you really see the value for money.

333
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:55,299
We rent a couple dollars an hour.

334
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,399
And then some other stuff are just

335
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,166
a bit more challenging in how you tell

336
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:00,432
the story of renting them.

337
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,432
Whether if it's cooking products

338
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:04,766
or if it's more personal stuff

339
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:06,699
that are still rentable.

340
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,232
So, I think these are some of our challenges.

341
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:10,432
Really learning the curve

342
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:14,599
of getting enough products rented in a month.

343
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,299
Changing our inventory and making it

344
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,566
contextual to the life of our users.

345
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:23,566
If it's a PS5 that just is coming out,

346
00:26:23,567 --> 00:26:24,466
you know we'll have it.

347
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:27,732
But also, being aligned with our mission,

348
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:29,966
which is to really always be

349
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:32,366
in the frontier of rentals.

350
00:26:32,367 --> 00:26:33,932
And how do we make more people

351
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:36,032
be adapt to it and learn about it

352
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:37,966
and try it for the first time.

353
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:40,199
So, and what is the business model?

354
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,099
So people come, paint me a picture.

355
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,932
They come in to the room.

356
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:43,699
They open the app.

357
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,799
They see a PlayStation five.

358
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,032
Then what happens?

359
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:48,899
And then they add credit.

360
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,732
They can choose a plan.

361
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:52,432
And then they rent it for as long they want.

362
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:53,666
And they have a ticking clock.

363
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:55,832
You pay by the hour.

364
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:57,599
When you're done, we ask you how it went

365
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,899
and we get you to rent it again.

366
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,132
Okay. So, you self-report everything. Right?

367
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:06,432
We what?

368
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:08,499
You self-report everything?

369
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,266
Yeah.

370
00:27:09,267 --> 00:27:10,832
Okay. That's very very cool.

371
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,699
And then, Yael, tell me a little bit

372
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,499
about your background.

373
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,932
So, you did quite a few projects

374
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:17,299
and you led quite a few organizations

375
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,532
prior to forming TULU.

376
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:22,066
So, where did you come from?

377
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:24,866
Well, I'm originally from Be'er Sheva.

378
00:27:24,867 --> 00:27:27,799
Lehavim, which is the southern part of Israel.

379
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,099
I moved to North Carolina for my middle school

380
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,766
and high school.

381
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:32,699
When I moved back to Israel

382
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,299
I became a tour guide in the army.

383
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,599
It was like hiking for two years,

384
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,032
which is a, very privileged.

385
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,132
I fell in love -
- I think you did it right

386
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:45,899
yeah. I was fascinated with nature.

387
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,232
With everything that's happening

388
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,232
with climate,

389
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:51,466
and I decided to learn, to study

390
00:27:51,467 --> 00:27:53,199
environmental science.

391
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,299
And in my bachelor’s degree,

392
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,166
I became an activist in the field of

393
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:01,032
environmental justice, transportation,

394
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:03,232
and then that's how I started learning

395
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:05,599
about food waste and also fashion waste

396
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,366
and consumption.

397
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:09,866
And these were I guess the seeds

398
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:13,032
but only when I was accepted into

399
00:28:13,033 --> 00:28:14,266
a program at MIT

400
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:16,832
which is called Our Generation Speaks.

401
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:20,666
We were in designX accelerator for three month,

402
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:22,866
and that's how I met Yishai, my co-founder.

403
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:27,599
And it was a year when I was listening to podcasts

404
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,599
all the time about entrepreneurship,

405
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,932
but I never really thought

406
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:32,166
I would do something myself.

407
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:34,666
I really thought I would go to an NGO

408
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,732
kind of world and hopefully also become

409
00:28:36,733 --> 00:28:38,532
maybe a politician.

410
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,099
Nothing was really set.

411
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,899
Wow. Quite a different path.

412
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,899
Yeah. But I think you can be an entrepreneur

413
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,832
in so many fields.

414
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:50,499
Just the tech world, it's where it's harvested.

415
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,599
But you can just, it's a mentality.

416
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,399
And when I met Yishai,

417
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,232
and he's coming from an architecture background

418
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:01,666
and my background,

419
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:03,299
things just kinda started to make sense.

420
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,432
And we said let's work together.

421
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:05,799
Let's create something together.

422
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,466
And we really started from

423
00:29:07,467 --> 00:29:09,866
the problem we're trying to solve

424
00:29:09,867 --> 00:29:10,866
and not from TULU.

425
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:14,666
TULU was just an evolution of other ideas

426
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:16,299
we've had and so we said,

427
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,999
"Okay, now we know what we are doing."

428
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,099
Interesting. I think that's amazing

429
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,466
because I think that really

430
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:23,332
a lot of entrepreneurs, they go on

431
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,466
the different path and say,

432
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:27,266
"I have this idea. I'm in love with it.

433
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,032
I think it's a great idea.

434
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:30,199
And now I'm gonna force myself

435
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,766
to understand that there's a problem

436
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:32,999
behind this idea"

437
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,599
But going through the approach of,

438
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,232
okay, well the world is changing.

439
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,632
People need to get stuff.

440
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:40,866
People don't wanna necessarily own the stuff.

441
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:42,732
It's expensive. It's cheap. It breaks.

442
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:45,632
There is a problem and now let's find

443
00:29:45,633 --> 00:29:46,632
a solution to this problem.

444
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:48,399
That's exactly how I wanna approach and start.

445
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,032
And what are some of the sort of

446
00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:52,399
earned secrets that you've learned

447
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,666
over the past few years running this thing

448
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:58,666
that perhaps you would go back and say

449
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:01,466
to your few years younger self?

450
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,499
Well, when we started the company,

451
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,932
I was still doing my environmental science

452
00:30:05,933 --> 00:30:07,066
master’s degree.

453
00:30:07,067 --> 00:30:09,066
And I was like, "Okay, I can do that

454
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:11,166
and that together. It's totally possible.

455
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:12,799
And I can also work"

456
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,132
And I think the minute I realized

457
00:30:15,133 --> 00:30:17,566
that I have, besides committing to TULU,

458
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:19,432
being my full-time thing.

459
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:20,799
It's also a mentality.

460
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,299
You have to wake up and go to bed

461
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,732
thinking about something

462
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:26,199
that's really meaningful to you

463
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,399
and you have to commit to it.

464
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,732
So, I had to leave everything

465
00:30:28,733 --> 00:30:30,899
and say okay it's scary.

466
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,566
It's really scary but I have to do it.

467
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:35,132
So, this is the first thing I learned

468
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,299
that I have to really prioritized

469
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,199
this and only that.

470
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,866
And when you build something,

471
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:43,632
you can have a really good idea

472
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,866
but it's about the team

473
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:46,632
and it's about the people you work with.

474
00:30:46,633 --> 00:30:49,099
And being a co-founder,

475
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,932
or leading something,

476
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:54,832
I can work 24/7 but in order for other people

477
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:57,066
to be aligned with what we're doing,

478
00:30:57,067 --> 00:30:58,766
you just have to create a sense of

479
00:30:58,767 --> 00:30:59,899
togetherness

480
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,499
which is something we're working on.

481
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,766
Right.

482
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:05,566
And personally, moving to New York

483
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:06,999
for that, it's just,

484
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,599
it's so much fun to see the similarities

485
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,932
between Tel Aviv and New York

486
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:12,466
with millennials mainly.

487
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:14,866
Like we have such similar buyer personas.

488
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:16,866
Such similar people that are adapting

489
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:18,866
and reacting the same way to our product.

490
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:22,599
And I'm just fascinated with the world of rental

491
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,366
'cause I really believe that,

492
00:31:24,367 --> 00:31:27,399
you know, going forward with everything

493
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,699
that's happening in the world,

494
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,866
and I'm not even talking about

495
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:30,766
the coronavirus.

496
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:33,766
I'm talking about the way we act as humans.

497
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:37,766
I really think solutions that are practical,

498
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:39,099
that are fun, that are sexy,

499
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,232
that are interesting,

500
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:41,399
these are the solutions that are

501
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,332
gonna carry people to be obsessed with

502
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:45,966
and to wanna use and to wanna pay for it.

503
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:49,566
And we decided to do it ourselves

504
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:51,466
rather than wait for someone else to do it.

505
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:53,366
I love it. So, where is this going?

506
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:54,766
So, now you have the challenge of,

507
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:55,766
okay, you have the product.

508
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:58,366
You found a product market fit in some areas.

509
00:31:58,367 --> 00:31:59,532
How do you get this now

510
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:00,432
to millions of people?

511
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:04,232
Well, you know, raising some money.

512
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:07,966
But definitely we are much more

513
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,666
comfortable now with what we're offering

514
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:14,399
and we know where we're aiming

515
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,799
and we know what could possibly happen.

516
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,766
And of course, we've been getting a lot of offers

517
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:22,399
that are shifting us from our original idea.

518
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,032
But yeah. Now we just wanna scale.

519
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:26,299
We're ready to scale. Ready to expand.

520
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,999
We're ready for partnerships.

521
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,432
So, it's been a lot of fun.

522
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:34,466
We're fantasizing and also doing together.

523
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:37,199
So, it's a lot of fun.

524
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,999
And it's really fun mainly talking to our users

525
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,432
and learning what they need

526
00:32:41,433 --> 00:32:42,566
and how it meets them.

527
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:45,099
You know, some people told us if

528
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,732
I knew I had a tool room in my building,

529
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:51,399
I would have come in a simpler way

530
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,532
to live in this building.

531
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:53,832
100%

532
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,266
But many times, we launch

533
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:57,132
after people already have their lease

534
00:32:57,133 --> 00:32:58,199
and they already bought everything.

535
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,632
So, I think going forward it's gonna be easy for us -

536
00:33:01,633 --> 00:33:02,432
... this is like the chicken and the egg now

537
00:33:02,433 --> 00:33:03,832
because you're entering a market that

538
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:05,566
the apartments are already filled

539
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,799
and sort of you have to wait until the next cycle

540
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,099
of tenants to be able to validate

541
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,066
whether they really forego purchasing

542
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:16,432
the items and getting them for TULU.

543
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:18,432
But you know Yael, last thing that

544
00:33:18,433 --> 00:33:19,632
I wanna mention is that you have a

545
00:33:19,633 --> 00:33:21,832
pretty interesting way of entering this

546
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,766
than, you know most co-founders

547
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:25,199
they grew up entrepreneurial.

548
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,866
Went to study computer science or business,

549
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:29,466
and they grow up knowing that they

550
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:30,066
want to do a startup,

551
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:32,232
but it sounds like you didn't really know

552
00:33:32,233 --> 00:33:34,232
you're going to do a startup.

553
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:35,432
Right a tour guide in the army.

554
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:36,866
Environmental science.

555
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:38,966
So, how is that process like for you?

556
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:43,199
I remember when I was a,

557
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,132
I had a different venture before TULU.

558
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:47,066
We were doing hydroponics on roofs

559
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,766
with a great friend.

560
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:50,332
And when I met him for the first time,

561
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:52,132
he told me, I was like "What do you do?"

562
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:53,232
And he said, "I'm an entrepreneur."

563
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:55,666
And it was for me like mind blowing.

564
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,132
What do you mean you're an entrepreneur?

565
00:33:57,133 --> 00:34:00,099
It's a thing. I'm an entrepreneur.

566
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,532
And I went home

567
00:34:01,533 --> 00:34:02,932
I googled entrepreneurship.

568
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:04,199
I had to learn about it.

569
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,732
I realized you can study it in university.

570
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:09,266
And that has just kind of sat with me.

571
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:10,099
And then I realized,

572
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:14,199
you know, if there is stuff or causes that

573
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,232
you really relate to and you wanna do

574
00:34:16,233 --> 00:34:17,099
something about it,

575
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,499
entrepreneurship is a tool.

576
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,599
And of course, now I'm surrounded

577
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,899
with the tech world and I see people that

578
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,466
they know more about it than me sometimes.

579
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:29,699
But it doesn’t intimidate me.

580
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,632
It's just that this is, to create

581
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:33,532
an interesting startup

582
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:35,732
you can come from a very you know,

583
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:38,499
It's just that there's such a wide range.

584
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,332
That's it. There's some a wide range

585
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:42,432
and I love being there in this range

586
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:43,399
and having my own leash.

587
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,899
And I've been finding lots of pleasure

588
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,332
talking to other women

589
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,566
from an environmental field

590
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:52,299
interested in also doing something like that.

591
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,699
Yeah. Yeah. No

592
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,299
Yael, it's very very impressive and

593
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,532
it's very very inspiring.

594
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:59,366
Before we leave, I have to ask three words

595
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:01,499
that you would best use to describe yourself.

596
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,766
I'm daring
- Hardest question.

597
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:06,399
I think I'm daring.

598
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,399
I'm also simple.

599
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,132
And I'm very optimistic.

600
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:15,032
Daring, simple, and optimistic.

601
00:35:15,033 --> 00:35:17,132
I like that combination.

602
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:18,566
Very very cool.

603
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:21,732
Yael, toda raba. Best of luck with TULU.

604
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:23,266
I hope that next year

605
00:35:23,267 --> 00:35:24,266
when I'm back at Stanford,

606
00:35:24,267 --> 00:35:25,266
you'll already be there.

607
00:35:25,267 --> 00:35:27,732
I do too

608
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:29,866
We'll talk

609
00:35:29,867 --> 00:35:31,799
And yeah, I look forward to

610
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,799
to maintaining this friendship.

611
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,632
Thank you very much.

612
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:35,732
Me too. Thank you so much for having me.

613
00:35:35,733 --> 00:36:11,367
Bye bye.
