132
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,120
Doron Simon, thank you so much

133
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,360
for being on 20 Minute Leaders.

134
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,520
So gracious of you.

135
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,360
Yeah. Thanks for having me.

136
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,360
So, we know each other

137
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,680
through J-Ventures,

138
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,080
the wonderful early stage

139
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,280
venture capital firm

140
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,420
here in Silicon Valley.

141
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,840
A capitalistic Kibbutz.

142
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,760
You're very recently a venture partner there

143
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,160
an LP in the screening committee.

144
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,480
But besides that,

145
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,600
you have a ton of experience

146
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,880
working with two incredible public

147
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,640
companies on growth and strategy,

148
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,720
Tower Semiconductor and Nice,

149
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,920
and I'd love to spend this episode

150
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,440
talking about just that.

151
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,920
Strategy and growth

152
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,640
and sort of the back scenes of

153
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,840
what drives these companies to success.

154
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,760
I love to share my experiences with that

155
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,960
with that opening.

156
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:16,760
Incredible.

157
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,920
So, Doron let's just start,

158
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,960
give me a little bit about yourself.

159
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,120
Like where are you from?

160
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,280
What excites you?

161
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,320
How do you even get to do what you did?

162
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,120
So grew up in Israel,

163
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,320
as you can detect from the accent.

164
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,840
I moved here as part

165
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,600
of Tower Semiconductor

166
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,520
when Silicon Valley was

167
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,480
still about silicon and semiconductors.

168
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,280
And this was around 2001.

169
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,320
Did Silicon Valley, was it

170
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
actually mainly about chips and silicon?

171
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,400
It was all about chips.

172
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,320
A while back and not too far.

173
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
Finally I get it,

174
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,440
only three years later.

175
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,720
Okay.

176
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,360
Amazing.

177
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,800
So, this is after

178
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,920
the standard career army

179
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,600
and then going to study the Technion

180
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,840
and starting some jobs in tech.

181
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,920
And over here, I spend some time

182
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,720
running Tower USA

183
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,920
as President and V.P. Marketing,

184
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,920
and also in between Tower and Nice,

185
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,680
I had a stint as a

186
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,480
consultant for six years

187
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,480
with early stage companies.

188
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,560
I've worked quite a bit with the

189
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,560
go to market strategies

190
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,360
for early stage companies of all types.

191
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,320
Right.

192
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,880
Okay, and just very quickly,

193
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,920
go to market strategy in two words

194
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,680
what does that mean for you?

195
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,800
So, for the early stage stuff,

196
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,440
it's something that many of the companies

197
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,480
have typically a need

198
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,880
or they recognize the need.

199
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,240
But they don't have

200
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,640
a defined product necessarily

201
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,680
or defined how you sell it,

202
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
how you package it,

203
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
what is the product,

204
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
is it a service,

205
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,700
is it something tangible?

206
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,600
So, even if they do have a product,

207
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,600
there is not necessarily a strategy

208
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,920
of how do you get this product

209
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,600
to fulfill this need.

210
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,040
We call it product/market fit

211
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,960
in the textbooks.

212
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,400
But it's a phase where you have to share

213
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,560
what you think with potential customers

214
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,760
and get feedback.

215
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,480
And at least hone on your first version

216
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,240
the minimum viable product.

217
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,840
With software, it's easier.

218
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,000
It's very easy to set up and test.

219
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,800
When you involve hardware

220
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,200
or things that are developed

221
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,120
in the physical world,

222
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,920
it's much tougher.

223
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,200
So, I did a lot of both

224
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,680
more, complicated machines typically.

225
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,280
Okay.

226
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,200
And then, how do you go

227
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,600
from that to growth strategy, M&A

228
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,400
because that's really the next part

229
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,120
of the life cycle of a startup, right?

230
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,520
Yeah.

231
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,320
So the way I look at it,

232
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
probably strategy and M&As

233
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,320
are the least discussed realities

234
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,680
in the you call it venture ecosystem.

235
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,040
When you look at it from the

236
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,400
startup side, I'll start with that.

237
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,240
Statistically, most startups

238
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,360
would end their life in,

239
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,280
as part of an M&A

240
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,960
if they are lucky.

241
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,280
Very few actually make it all the way

242
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,040
to an IPO and many fall on the way.

243
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,600
But M&A is a big piece

244
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,120
of the outcome of a startup.

245
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,480
And startups don't gear up

246
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,320
and don't build themself

247
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,280
towards an M&A.

248
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,520
And there is basically

249
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,920
an art to how you do it right.

250
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,480
We'll leave that for later.

251
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,880
From a company

252
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,760
that is a established point of view,

253
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,840
once you've crossed a certain threshold,

254
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,640
and this is typically in the already

255
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,720
multi-million dollar type revenue

256
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,440
so call it 10, 15, 20,

257
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,440
and you start to grow

258
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,120
there's quite a bit of runway,

259
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,840
which you could do by focusing

260
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,560
on what you set up the company to do initially.

261
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,000
Right.

262
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,520
And then starts to be a more strategic approach

263
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,680
of growth that could be coming out

264
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,520
of outside of your core.

265
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,600
How do you accelerate?

266
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,080
How do you address non-core either

267
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,480
features or markets?

268
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,520
How do you respond to market changes?

269
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,880
How do you head risks?

270
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,320
And you get to the more creative side

271
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,000
of business development,

272
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,120
which is either partnerships,

273
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,320
strategic partnerships,

274
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,280
core development,

275
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,440
and eventually M&As.

276
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,320
And in M&As, you're either

277
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,320
being acquired or being the acquirer.

278
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:31,600
So hold on.

279
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,080
This is really complicated

280
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,720
because what you're

281
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,720
essentially saying is

282
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,200
let's look at a life-cycle

283
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,800
of a startup. We're starting out,

284
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
we're running the company,

285
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,120
we're controlling the product,

286
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,480
we're the ones selling it,

287
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,320
and then we reach a point in time

288
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,960
where we are making enough revenue,

289
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,360
you said 10, 15, 20 million,

290
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,920
and we have to start making these

291
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,520
creative decisions of

292
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,720
how do we position ourselves

293
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,520
as key players

294
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,760
and how do we collaborate

295
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,120
and work with potentially

296
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,920
other key players,

297
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,080
either as partnerships,

298
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,360
mergers or acquisitions?

299
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,200
Right. So that is the

300
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,360
interesting phase of mind switch.

301
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,560
We're not alone in this.

302
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,080
Now we're in the big players league

303
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,560
and we can actually work with others

304
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,080
and provide value to others.

305
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,400
Yeah, that's exactly right.

306
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,240
The threshold could vary quite a bit.

307
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,160
So it could happen in 15

308
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,680
it could happen at 150

309
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,360
but in order to cross the billion,

310
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,960
the two companies that I've had

311
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,320
my longest career runs with

312
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,400
are at one and a half billion dollar run rate.

313
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:27,880
Right.

314
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,120
To get to the billion league,

315
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,440
and this is in sales

316
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,520
not in valuation,

317
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,280
it's not the unicorn billion

318
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,800
it's the actual sales

319
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,520
revenue generating sales.

320
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,320
Per year?

321
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,080
You can get a little bit more

322
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,080
than just your initial momentum.

323
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,320
So you mean that was

324
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,960
a billion and a half yearly revenue?

325
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,280
Yeah.

326
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,560
That's insane.

327
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,280
So, you were essentially helping

328
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,760
lead growth and strategy

329
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,680
in two companies that are public

330
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,640
and they're generating

331
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,560
over a billion dollars in revenue a year.

332
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,000
So, not their market cap is a billion,

333
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,880
but they're generating

334
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,000
a billion in revenue.

335
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,200
Which means you have

336
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,760
a lot of things you can do.

337
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,040
Yeah.

338
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,600
And that's where you come in.

339
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,920
And that's where I come in.

340
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,320
So you generate cash, typically

341
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,120
you get out of the cash starvation mode.

342
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,640
Right.

343
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,840
But you still need to use it wisely

344
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,560
and you need to make sure that

345
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,720
every dollar you invest brings you

346
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,920
much more than that dollar worth

347
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,480
in future returns.

348
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,840
What is that role?

349
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,640
Strategy and growth.

350
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,920
How do even study

351
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,040
for that and prepare for that?

352
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,640
So, there is no official title for it.

353
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,600
Many MBAs would eventually

354
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
end up doing pieces of that.

355
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,360
But the role is basically something

356
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,880
that you develop within big corporations.

357
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,760
There's no playbook or school to go to

358
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,960
besides gaining experience.

359
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,600
And essentially every CEO,

360
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,400
or business leader

361
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,960
that is taking a company

362
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,080
to that journey of a

363
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,860
billion dollar company,

364
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,200
comes across the need for that.

365
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,200
How you do it is different.

366
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,840
How you do could vary

367
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,520
from one company to another

368
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,600
in a substantial way.

369
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:13,740
But you wanna get it right?

370
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,680
...

371
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,800
understanding at the core,

372
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,040
What is your market?

373
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,360
What is your strength?

374
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,960
And in a very realistic assessment,

375
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,120
what you're missing

376
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,520
and what you can get better outside,

377
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,800
which is the first part,

378
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,800
that's what I call the easy part

379
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,840
and when I say easy it's still hardwork.

380
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,440
Yeah.

381
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,920
You need to remember that for every M&A

382
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,600
that happens out there,

383
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,840
there's probably 10, 15 or 20

384
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,560
that you looked at

385
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,080
and you passed for various reasons

386
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,760
before you decide to pull the plug

387
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,080
on the single M&A in a corporate.

388
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,600
And then comes the hard part,

389
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,760
which is the execution.

390
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,520
The integration into a big company.

391
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,560
There's a lot of aspects to consider.

392
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,840
When you integrate, cultural,

393
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,160
work environment,

394
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,480
just different lexicon, different lingo

395
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,200
though you may be in the same market.

396
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,000
A lot of little details that basically

397
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,040
are planned to guarantee that the M&A is

398
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,440
eventually successful and statistically -

399
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,200
Give me give me a couple of those

400
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,920
earned secrets from your experience

401
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,240
in watching M&As

402
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,400
and different deals come about.

403
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,400
Because a lot of them are not successful right.

404
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,240
We hear all the time of these

405
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,120
different acquisitions who turn out,

406
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,080
the technologies didn't integrate,

407
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,400
and the cultures were too different,

408
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,440
or maybe financially it was just didn't make sense.

409
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,120
How can we even start to evaluate

410
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,600
ahead of time whether

411
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,280
an M&A will be successful or not?

412
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,920
So, first statistics in the big world

413
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,880
works against you.

414
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,120
It's similar to startups.

415
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,240
Really? Most M&As fail?

416
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,320
Yeah. Depends whose book you read,

417
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,120
but statistically beyond 50% fail

418
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,400
or don't achieve their original targets.

419
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,920
Wow.

420
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,160
And it does take a lot of discipline

421
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,080
and a lot of planning to do it right.

422
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,840
I believe that also,

423
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,320
you have to consider

424
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,560
the post merger activities

425
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,800
with a lot of what you call EQ,

426
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,680
Emotional IQ,

427
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,320
and treat people in a way that

428
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,840
basically shows them the way

429
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,640
in joining a bigger company

430
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,160
as a career opportunity,

431
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,480
rather the end of the journey.

432
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,120
And a lot of startups

433
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,240
are triggered by the fact that

434
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,400
when they sell out,

435
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,680
it's the end of the journey

436
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,360
as opposed to a start of a new journey,

437
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,200
which is where some of the benefits

438
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,840
could be reaped by the bigger company.

439
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,480
So, unless you buy technology,

440
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,720
if you want to buy a business

441
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,200
and continue to operate and grow it,

442
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,240
you have to keep the team motivated.

443
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,440
You have to get them into your family

444
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,680
and you have to learn how to

445
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,240
leverage each other's strength,

446
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,120
which is a very in a way,

447
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,080
it's a tough process

448
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
for every human being.

449
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,720
It's like switching families.

450
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,720
Well, no I mean, and you see the,

451
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,240
a lot of different extremes.

452
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,240
You see some companies

453
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,800
after they perform an acquisition,

454
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,920
they keep the other company

455
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,590
as a separate entity completely,

456
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,440
maintaining their

457
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,920
culture and their DNA.

458
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,840
You see others that are absorbing them

459
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,520
and bring them directly into their offices,

460
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
and you know, change your,

461
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,440
from now on you're company X

462
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,840
before you were Y.

463
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,240
Is there now an insight into

464
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,120
how do you do that best?

465
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Or is it a case by case basis really?

466
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,440
To me, and this is coming from

467
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,840
a company that did M&As

468
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,320
at the rate of, let's call it

469
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,600
on average of three or four a year,

470
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,160
there is no playbook per se.

471
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,520
You adjust the case for the company

472
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,280
and it's also a case of the acquirer.

473
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,400
Who is the business owner

474
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,200
that gets to run the acquisition?

475
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,160
And, you know, ideally,

476
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,520
you can buy something and run it

477
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,080
as a standalone company

478
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,120
if everything is perfect.

479
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,840
But it's not the only playbook.

480
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,320
If you're talking about serial acquirers,

481
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,000
people like Cisco, The Times,

482
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,880
Oracle, Salesforce,

483
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,320
they're more operating based on playbooks

484
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,400
and ... history

485
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,200
that is just sheer numbers.

486
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,720
But again, I do feel that when you do

487
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
a major acquisition,

488
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,440
when you go into something

489
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,720
that is transformational,

490
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,240
and I've done,

491
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,560
I was involved in something like that

492
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,120
at Nice,

493
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,880
you have to prepare its own playbook.

494
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,200
You can't just open a generic one

495
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,720
and say, "This is my way"

496
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,320
Interesting.

497
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,760
I wanna go a little bit back to growth

498
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,200
because now I'm asking

499
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,560
for some personal tips.

500
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,280
I wish for myself that I'll get

501
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,400
to a position sooner rather than later

502
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,840
that I grow a startup that that has made

503
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,520
a positive impact, has generated revenue,

504
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,560
and now I'm at a position as

505
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,760
in a leadership role where I can now

506
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,280
leverage my new cash flow

507
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,720
to grow the company

508
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,360
and to think more broadly

509
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,000
about how do we become a key player.

510
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,680
What are some of the key challenges or

511
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,720
opportunities for a young entrepreneur

512
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,240
who has never experienced this before?

513
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,920
You have a lot of CEOs that all of a sudden

514
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,760
fall into, they have ...

515
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,760
that generates a lot of revenue

516
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,760
and now they have to make

517
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,880
these strategic decisions.

518
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,280
So, how can I best position myself

519
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,680
when I get to that position,

520
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,960
if I get to that position,

521
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,440
to make the right decision?

522
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,720
So, it is quite, call it, mundane.

523
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,240
When you talk about strategy,

524
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,680
there's a clear way of

525
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,560
working out a strategy.

526
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
It starts with analyzing

527
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,280
your strengths and weaknesses

528
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,320
and what are the growth

529
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,120
areas you want to aim.

530
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,720
You talk to customers all the time.

531
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,920
This is something a CEO

532
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,400
knows very well how to do.

533
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,200
And when you talk to customers

534
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,400
and actually listen to them,

535
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,200
not just talk to them,

536
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,560
and a startup CEO by the way

537
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,760
they talk first because

538
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
they are used to selling more,

539
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,160
they're educating the market on a new thing.

540
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,560
At a certain point in time,

541
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,800
you have to start to listen

542
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,480
and pick up clues.

543
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,920
What's missing in features?

544
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,760
What's missing in complementary products?

545
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,320
I've seen this company doing a great job

546
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,320
that works together with your

547
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,600
product side by side.

548
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,120
Maybe you want to talk to them

549
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,640
to see if you can cooperate.

550
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,520
You have to be very attentive

551
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
to clues like that

552
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,440
in order to develop

553
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,720
that what they call non-organic strategy

554
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,600
and start to address,

555
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,760
you have to know your market.

556
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,040
You have to know the ecosystem.

557
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,880
You have to know

558
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,520
what your competitors are doing.

559
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,600
And the role of that strategy function

560
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,000
or business development function

561
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,720
is to connect all of these inputs

562
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,600
and roll them into one

563
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,000
coherent strategy and a plan.

564
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,520
Okay.

565
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,320
So it's not just going with your

566
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,880
co-founders to the beach

567
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,560
over a weekend on a retreat

568
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,240
and then talking about some startup.

569
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,160
I'm kidding, of course.

570
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,320
But that's what they show

571
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,520
in the movies at least.

572
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,040
Doron, I also want to talk,

573
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,520
because you are coming from Israel.

574
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,960
And one of the things that

575
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,960
a lot of people are are saying,

576
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,560
you know the startup nation is fantastic,

577
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,320
and there's so many great, great companies.

578
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,000
And I've also heard the term

579
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,440
"Exit Nation" roll around a few times.

580
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,400
And it seems like there is

581
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,920
sort of a different mentality,

582
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,080
especially when it comes

583
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,040
to this growth and M&A stage

584
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,760
between a lot of Israeli companies

585
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,520
and companies that are founded

586
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,440
and based in the US.

587
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,480
Do you also see some difference?

588
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,200
Or is there any difference

589
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,640
in mindset in that regard?

590
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,400
I think there is a difference of mindset

591
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,000
and there are many factors

592
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,560
that could be attributed to that,

593
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,960
but first, there is a change.

594
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
In the recent years,

595
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,200
you're seeing more companies

596
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,560
break that, call it, one billion dollar

597
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,440
in sales ceiling

598
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,480
and getting to be more common

599
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,680
the things like that

600
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,680
would would happen.

601
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,320
But there is also an ecosystem

602
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,040
that you need to work with

603
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,160
when you do those M&As

604
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,640
and strategic moves

605
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,720
and this is something that

606
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,880
could involve bankers

607
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,680
and investors, access to capital.

608
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,480
And sometimes in

609
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,080
the Israeli ecosystem

610
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,680
it's a very local community

611
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,480
they don't think as much

612
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,440
about that piece of the growth

613
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,600
as the U.S. oriented bankers

614
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,080
and financial ecosystem

615
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,160
around companies.

616
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,760
So, it's not an Israeli mentality thing per se.

617
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,520
You've got a lot of very good

618
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,280
Israeli founders that do it here

619
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,440
in a different way.

620
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,200
But the Israeli ecosystem,

621
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,840
I don't think it is developed yet

622
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,400
enough to address all of these

623
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,840
auxiliary needs.

624
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,600
Okay. So, you're thinking about

625
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,920
in the realm of the Israeli ecosystem

626
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,800
which is, you know,

627
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,400
'cause you need a lot of moving players

628
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,000
to get to a growth mindset

629
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,400
in terms of your ability

630
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,480
to actually grow a company

631
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,000
to that level and get to an M&A.

632
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,600
And it's more about the maturity

633
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,640
of all the players around

634
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,760
not just the founders themselves.

635
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,280
Absolutely. And you've got

636
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,360
very sophisticated set of VCs

637
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,720
which have that, call it, 10 to 12 years

638
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,600
runway mentality.

639
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,520
And somebody needs to take it from there

640
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,200
and this is typically their private equities or bankers,

641
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,200
or other pieces of that ecosystem.

642
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,800
Fascinating. And this is just also,

643
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,560
it sounds like there's so many

644
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,200
moving pieces and it's so much

645
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,480
more complicated than just this

646
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,880
this young and hardy notion of,

647
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,880
let's just create a company

648
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,800
and grow it to be a billion dollars.

649
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,760
No, you actually get to real stuff

650
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,680
that you have to consider

651
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,840
a lot of moving pieces.

652
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,440
And it's not just about the founder.

653
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,800
It's not just about the company.

654
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,360
It's also about your whole market and

655
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,160
where you position it.

656
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,400
Doron, what excites you?

657
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,840
You see so many companies.

658
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,280
You've worked with so many.

659
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,200
What really excites you on the day to day?

660
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,800
So, first every time I see a new founder

661
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,640
with a new idea that kind of resonates with me,

662
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,280
it excites. It excites and gets you energized.

663
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,560
Just because you just identify with

664
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,240
what they're creating or about to create.

665
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,960
Besides that, I love to see a plan

666
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,880
comes through. Okay.

667
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,880
I love to see a plan that you put

668
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,280
four or five or six years ago

669
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,760
and all of a sudden

670
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,880
you look back and say,

671
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,240
"It actually worked.

672
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,240
It was a playbook"

673
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,320
And this is something that is

674
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,920
very very satisfying and exciting.

675
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,200
I'm sure.

676
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,320
And besides that, the deal.

677
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,880
Every time you're involved in a deal

678
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,080
that's an exciting phase.

679
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,880
How many how many exciting deals

680
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,560
would you say you've been

681
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,600
involved with over the years?

682
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,440
I would say, it's probably north of 30.

683
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,880
North of 30 deals?

684
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,280
Yes. Some of them are small.

685
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,080
Some of them are bigger.

686
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,600
But yeah.

687
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,120
Doron, what's small?

688
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,880
What's a small deal?

689
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,640
Small could be an acquisition

690
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,320
that is an acquihire or

691
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,680
technology acquisition

692
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,360
that you do just for a tuck in.

693
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,160
Typically you don't hear about those.

694
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,760
Those are the typical quiet ones.

695
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,320
And some of them could be

696
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:27,880
much much bigger.

697
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,920
Much more involved.

698
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,040
Much more complicated.

699
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,600
I'm sure. Well, you know.

700
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:33,610
Doron, just to give context

701
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,680
I mean, the majority of people

702
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,520
in the tech industry,

703
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,400
especially entrepreneurs

704
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,120
and tech executives,

705
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,320
wish they would be a part

706
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,680
of a single great deal

707
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,160
throughout their lives.

708
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,160
So, just listening to you,

709
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,240
I'm getting so much insight and seeing

710
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,280
you've gone through more than 30 deals

711
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,240
whether they're big or small,

712
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,280
I mean, that's just so inspiring.

713
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,120
Doron, we only have just a few minutes left.

714
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,280
But I love to ask this last question to everybody.

715
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,520
And I'd love to know three words

716
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,400
that you would best use to describe yourself?

717
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,600
I'm especially curious,

718
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,680
I hear from people of all industries.

719
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,000
So, what are your three words?

720
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,840
Three words.

721
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,400
One for sure would be foresight,

722
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,440
Foresight. What does that mean? Explain.

723
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,240
Being able to look ahead.

724
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,360
Okay.

725
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,400
Behind the curve.

726
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,680
So, foresight, I would say you have to have

727
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,000
tenacity to last in this industry.

728
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,680
Do what I do.

729
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,920
And the underrated one

730
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,040
of all is team player.

731
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,480
I think that's critical

732
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
to be a team player.

733
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,200
You mentioned right before we started

734
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,440
the call that one of the things

735
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,040
that you are very proud of is that

736
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,360
a lot of the great successes you've been

737
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,480
a part of it's not necessarily

738
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,440
that you had to be, you know,

739
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,400
the founder or the leader.

740
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,440
But you sometimes you were the guy

741
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,200
in the back behind the scenes

742
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,160
that was really thinking things through

743
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,680
and allowing for the great deals to happen.

744
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,320
But at the end, you're a team player.

745
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,680
That's how you identify yourself,

746
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,280
which I think is beautiful.

747
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,360
Yeah. A lot of

748
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,760
business development guys

749
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,800
are in the shadows

750
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,440
for many, many reasons.

751
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,920
But I have met over my career

752
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,040
some great ones, and

753
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,000
they're all able to foresee and execute.

754
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,560
I love it.

755
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,120
Doron, thank you so much for the time.

756
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,640
Thank you for the inspiration.

757
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,320
And I'm just going to have to see you

758
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,400
around in the J-Ventures meetings.

759
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,960
I can't wait to see us

760
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:22,960
face to face again.

761
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,680
Thank you. Take care.
