1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,120
A good founder has to have

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,840
has to have a lot of dedication

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,274
and enough of flexibility

4
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:08,320
to be able to reinvent itself.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,320
For me, this is the difference

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,560
between the companies that are successful

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,830
and companies that are going nowhere.

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,500
Levy Raiz, thank you so much for joining me.

9
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:47,960
How are you?

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,400
Thank you.

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,280
Thanks for making this happen.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,400
It wasn't easy, I know.

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,520
It wasn't easy,

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,391
but I'm so glad that we made this happen

15
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:58,704
with all the difficulties in the scheduling.

16
00:00:58,904 --> 00:01:00,722
And I believe that you mentioned

17
00:01:00,922 --> 00:01:02,200
after one of our mishaps email,

18
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:03,560
if it's really difficult,

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,800
it means that it's really, really good.

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,040
So, I'm going with that mindset into this.

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,560
Levy, let's talk about investments

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,480
these 20 minutes.

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,240
And you've had the privilege of sitting

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,592
on numerous positions

25
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:18,522
with venture capital funds.

26
00:01:18,722 --> 00:01:20,720
And you've seen countless entrepreneurs.

27
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,680
And I'd love to sort of pick your brain

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,730
from your experiences

29
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,040
on some of the key insights that you've gained,

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,796
whether it's about

31
00:01:26,996 --> 00:01:28,808
the type of person you like to invest in,

32
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:30,714
or how does the whole pipeline

33
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,680
look in your mind,

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,040
or what entrepreneurs should be doing

35
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,120
as they're approaching the fundraising.

36
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,040
So, Levy, I'll let you take it from here.

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,857
Tell me maybe a little bit about yourself

38
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:40,920
and where you come from.

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Okay. Let's start with that.

40
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,350
So, in a few words about myself.

41
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:48,637
I'm in VC for the last eight years.

42
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:51,320
Before that, I've been doing

43
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,263
building companies myself.

44
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:55,965
I had four companies so far.

45
00:01:56,165 --> 00:01:58,773
I know one of them actually succeeded

46
00:01:58,973 --> 00:01:59,760
and I sold it.

47
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,277
The second one is also a success.

48
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:05,680
It still exists and working and making money.

49
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,200
And the two other ones I just miserably failed.

50
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,440
So, that was why so I kind of learned.

51
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,120
In what order, by the way?

52
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,880
What was the order of them?

53
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,960
Yeah, it was success.

54
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,840
It was the failure.

55
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,333
Second, kind of success,

56
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:25,440
and then the failure.

57
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,240
I like that. I like the zigzag.

58
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:33,280
So, I always say it's better to fail fast

59
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,720
rather than drag it out for years.

60
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,440
So, that's my professional career.

61
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,425
And eight years ago,

62
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,022
I've been privileged to be invited

63
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:50,089
to join one of the VCs

64
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:52,720
to become a partner in the CPC.

65
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,240
We've invested a lot of companies

66
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,336
here in Israel and I've been privileged

67
00:02:59,536 --> 00:03:01,440
to do some great investments

68
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,200
and some really bad investments.

69
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,747
And now this days with the Digital Horizon VC,

70
00:03:08,947 --> 00:03:11,132
we are an early stage firm.

71
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:13,526
I'm a venture partner dealing with

72
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,720
all the deal flow in Israel.

73
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,327
And I'm thirty four,

74
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:23,640
married to another beautiful entrepreneur.

75
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,120
We have three kids who are also probably

76
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,320
look like they're very different home.

77
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,160
That's me. That's me.

78
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,245
What differentiates between

79
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:36,044
the good investments that you've made

80
00:03:36,244 --> 00:03:37,177
and the bad investments?

81
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:38,760
The really good ones and the really bad ones.

82
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,981
Is there some pattern recognition

83
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:42,784
that you now understand,

84
00:03:42,984 --> 00:03:44,754
looking back at the few that succeeded

85
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:46,240
and the few that didn't succeed?

86
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,524
Yeah, I think I can find some.

87
00:03:49,724 --> 00:03:51,600
You know, there are a lot of factors

88
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,000
that are kind of objective.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,297
And sometimes it's great team,

90
00:03:55,497 --> 00:03:58,440
great technology and there is some just

91
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,840
objective factor.

92
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,663
The market timing is wrong

93
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:05,400
or there is something out there

94
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,520
that is not dependent on us,

95
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,320
which doesn't work.

96
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,400
That happens all the time

97
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,720
and that's normal.

98
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,320
Now, that's why we're investing to it.

99
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,600
That's why it's called venture capital

100
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
we take risk.

101
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,240
With the other cases

102
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,360
where it's more of a people's issue.

103
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:25,440
I would say that the dedication of founders

104
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,000
mixed with the flexibility

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,499
of their kind of mindset is that what I found

106
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:33,763
as a crucial, crucial things.

107
00:04:33,963 --> 00:04:35,400
What do I mean by that,

108
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,696
there are a lot of you always trying to invest

109
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:40,200
into dedicated founder,

110
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,831
but when this founder is very dedicated

111
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:45,880
and has no flexibility

112
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,194
and is just going straight, straight ahead,

113
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:52,878
hitting the mountain head to head

114
00:04:53,078 --> 00:04:54,760
sometimes it doesn't work.

115
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,400
And you need to be flexible enough

116
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,671
to accept this and to not go

117
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:04,560
and just like be completely broken,

118
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,000
but reinvent yourself.

119
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:07,327
So, those companies

120
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:09,840
that succeed to reinvent themselves,

121
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,371
those are the good ones.

122
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:14,251
The ones that kind of hit the wall

123
00:05:14,451 --> 00:05:16,120
and can't reinvent themselves,

124
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,640
those are the ones that kind of die off.

125
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,120
So, that's the main difference.

126
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,320
I would say the good founder has to have

127
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,080
has to have a lot of dedication

128
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,514
and enough of flexibility

129
00:05:28,714 --> 00:05:30,560
to be able to reinvent itself.

130
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,520
This is the for me, this is the difference

131
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,760
between the companies that are successful

132
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,640
and companies that are going nowhere.

133
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,406
But how do you measure flexibility

134
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:43,080
when you do, let's say,

135
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,840
three week due diligence process,

136
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,360
you meet the entrepreneur four or five times.

137
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,960
How do you measure

138
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,880
an entrepreneurs ability to be flexible?

139
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,221
Because you're also you're funding

140
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:55,080
in the early stages,

141
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,440
when you're essentially investing in the person.

142
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,120
How do you measure flexibility?

143
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,960
That's actually a great question.

144
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,215
This is something that it took me at least time

145
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:07,840
to learn and to figure it out.

146
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,282
In real life, what matters when you go

147
00:06:11,482 --> 00:06:12,523
and you meet a person

148
00:06:12,723 --> 00:06:13,891
and when you actually have

149
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:15,320
a more deeper conversations,

150
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,867
when it's not just a pitch

151
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:19,391
and they just like pitching you the company,

152
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:20,600
we're saying, "What do you think?"

153
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,240
And so, like,

154
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,880
when you actually have a deeper,

155
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,275
deeper conversations

156
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:27,960
and you meet the whole team

157
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,468
and you see the dynamics between them,

158
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:33,120
you see how they actually interact.

159
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,150
Because usually, usually people

160
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,163
have a very different opinions.

161
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,120
In early stage, if there is a strong team,

162
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,920
there are always strong opinions.

163
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,648
And there are two ways of kind of

164
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:45,880
those companies to work.

165
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,120
Sometimes it's just a clash of opinions.

166
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,120
And in the end, someone just says,

167
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,200
"You know what? Okay.

168
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,400
I'm the CEO, so I'll decide."

169
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,280
And things are not heard much.

170
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,520
Another thing is that you can see that

171
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,880
it's a very slight different.

172
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,735
The CEO isn't the final decision maker,

173
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,360
because that's what you want from a CEO.

174
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,573
But you see that

175
00:07:07,773 --> 00:07:09,892
he might be completely disagree

176
00:07:10,092 --> 00:07:12,080
with the other opinion,

177
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,040
but he'll still consider it.

178
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,623
So, there's a slight difference.

179
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:17,314
If you feel that there is,

180
00:07:17,514 --> 00:07:18,920
I think this is a good sign,

181
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,680
it's not a guarantee,

182
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,862
but it's a good sign that

183
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:23,160
there is enough flexibility in this person.

184
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,720
And just something you learn

185
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,960
from those two, three weeks

186
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,400
of having conversations.

187
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,240
I have, for example,

188
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,120
I have a several occasions where I have

189
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,200
to find kind of pull out the term sheets

190
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,641
when we've already got to the point

191
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:42,300
when it wasn't the first date or second date,

192
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:45,360
when I was kind of that we started

193
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,160
our relationship to the next level.

194
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,316
And right before signing the term sheet,

195
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:55,683
you see that the person has just lost,

196
00:07:55,883 --> 00:08:00,360
his flexibility ended after a third meeting

197
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,640
and now it's like he's completely

198
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,560
or she's completely inflexible.

199
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,440
And that's where I usually pull out,

200
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,000
if that happens.

201
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,560
Right. I think that's really interesting.

202
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,080
And so, how many investments

203
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,933
would you say you've seen

204
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:22,080
or played around with over your career?

205
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,798
I have a portfolio of twenty five plus companies

206
00:08:25,998 --> 00:08:28,830
that I actually, like my teams and I invested.

207
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:33,164
The overall, I would say probably over,

208
00:08:33,364 --> 00:08:35,360
over these eight years,

209
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,880
probably several thousand companies.

210
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,280
And honestly, to be honest,

211
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,720
that I actually like dug in deeply,

212
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,400
I would say it's probably

213
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,160
maybe five, 700, I don't know,

214
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:55,000
a lot of companies those eight years.

215
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,869
So, what part of this cycle

216
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:01,247
of venture capital

217
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:03,400
do you enjoy most personally?

218
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,680
So, there's so many different

219
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,600
moving pieces, right?

220
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,680
And anybody who's gone through

221
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,320
a cycle of fundraising knows that

222
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,640
it's like a big roller coaster,

223
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,680
both for the entrepreneur,

224
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,759
but also for the investor

225
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,047
from the deal sourcing

226
00:09:14,247 --> 00:09:15,560
to the diligence to the decision

227
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,760
to then supporting the portfolio company.

228
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,960
It's a whole balogun.

229
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,760
So, which part is your favorite?

230
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,240
So, the favorite part is really

231
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,080
is a some kind of a exit.

232
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
You know, that's the favorite part for everyone.

233
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,720
And when everyone is happy

234
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,020
and usually it's after the hard,

235
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:37,240
like the hard track of difficulties

236
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,600
and all kinds of things happen.

237
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,232
Now, you're asking about like more,

238
00:09:40,432 --> 00:09:43,640
like earlier part there's a joke between VCs.

239
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,880
VCs say that the fun is over

240
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,420
when you actually wire the money.

241
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,200
That's one.

242
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
So, the part before that,

243
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,098
the whole getting to know the company,

244
00:09:54,298 --> 00:09:56,080
meeting the entrepreneurs,

245
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,400
getting really into what they are doing,

246
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,462
and being getting to know the entrepreneurs,

247
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:06,720
I think this is the funnest part.

248
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,080
This is the most enjoyable part.

249
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,467
And specifically, sometimes,

250
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:12,520
you just click with the founders,

251
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,080
with the entrepreneurs.

252
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,042
So, for me, the people ability

253
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:22,154
to kind of become a part of their journey

254
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:25,644
and be helpful to them

255
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:27,196
and meet their world,

256
00:10:27,396 --> 00:10:30,118
because you're like you meet those

257
00:10:30,318 --> 00:10:32,200
very very exciting people

258
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,125
who are like they've done things,

259
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:36,400
they are doing things.

260
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:37,800
They are dreamers,

261
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,960
they're executioners.

262
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,240
And you kind of you get all this energy,

263
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,920
this is the most exciting part.

264
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,773
And also, that's where you decide for yourself

265
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:49,582
how you can actually be helpful

266
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:50,360
to the company,

267
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,811
like what you can actually deliver.

268
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:55,661
A lot of funds,

269
00:10:55,861 --> 00:11:00,560
a lot of VCs say value add and like,

270
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,360
I'll make introductions,

271
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,760
I'll bring you in more and more investor

272
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,840
to help you raise money and so on.

273
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:13,039
So, that's something that a lot of VCs can do

274
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,960
because everyone comes

275
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,880
with some kind of background.

276
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,520
So, sometimes it's,

277
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,440
it's when you connect to the CEO

278
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,713
and we actually feel

279
00:11:22,913 --> 00:11:24,000
that we can help the CEO

280
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,684
on specific tasks

281
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:28,080
like the CEO comes to you and says,

282
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,031
"Hey, bro, I need help

283
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,160
with hiring this person."

284
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,280
"I can't fill this position for a while."

285
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,960
"Please help, help."

286
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,178
That's what kind of makes you feel

287
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:42,528
like you're really part of this company

288
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:46,303
when you can solve specific issues

289
00:11:46,503 --> 00:11:49,490
and not just be another person

290
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,680
to make introductions.

291
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,351
That makes perfect sense.

292
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:55,986
So, if you're now looking at

293
00:11:56,186 --> 00:11:56,960
young entrepreneurs

294
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,920
that are starting their journey,

295
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,560
perhaps they've never raised money from VCs,

296
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,880
or they're now, they're reaching new rounds

297
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,120
that they haven't reached before.

298
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,374
So, what advice would you give them

299
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,829
as they're thinking, both in terms of

300
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,800
growing and scaling the company?

301
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,560
And you've seen some companies scale

302
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,208
with the portfolio

303
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:17,415
or in terms of their communication

304
00:12:17,615 --> 00:12:21,056
with the venture capital partners.

305
00:12:21,256 --> 00:12:24,040
Okay. That's a good question.

306
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:28,760
I would say, first of all,

307
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,040
it has to be you have to realize

308
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,560
that the raising money is not easy.

309
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,800
It's just not it's not a simple process.

310
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,984
And there will be a lot of discouraging moments

311
00:12:42,184 --> 00:12:44,081
when people will be saying,

312
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:46,400
you'll get no up to no.

313
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,290
And also you will get

314
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,389
multiple completely contradicting opinions

315
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:55,200
from smart people.

316
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,760
You go to one smart VC and he tells you,

317
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,680
"Hey, you're doing all these wrong."

318
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,440
"You have to do XYZ."

319
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,640
And you'll go to another person

320
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,000
and he'll tell you completely opposite thing.

321
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,087
So, you have to be able to focus

322
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,826
on what you do and be kind of,

323
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:13,360
again flexibility.

324
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:14,440
Listen to the people,

325
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:17,800
get their feedback just a little bit

326
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:20,200
but keep your core.

327
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,840
Don't link analogies.

328
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,400
Don't go and change your

329
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,600
what do you do from meeting to meeting.

330
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,920
That's one thing.

331
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,680
How do you balance that?

332
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,067
So, how do you balance

333
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:35,280
when you're approaching two different VCs,

334
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,640
both very reputable,

335
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,400
but they're giving contradictory ideas

336
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,600
and you're sort of in the middle?

337
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,602
Because the whole power struggle

338
00:13:44,802 --> 00:13:45,797
at that point is

339
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:47,600
the VC is more knowledgeable.

340
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,920
They're assessing your validity.

341
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,535
And if a VC tells you that

342
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:53,240
you're doing something wrong,

343
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,560
then you're questioning yourself.

344
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,392
Another VC says you're doing something right

345
00:13:56,592 --> 00:13:57,855
then now you're confused

346
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,040
as to how to approach this.

347
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,600
So, I think, first of all,

348
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:08,000
the by default, by definition, I wouldn't say

349
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:10,520
that the VC is more knowledgeable.

350
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,080
or smarter than you.

351
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,960
The VC is another entrepreneur,

352
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,127
hopefully another entrepreneur

353
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:17,760
who is just in a different stage in his life.

354
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,760
And someone who, a VC

355
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,533
the good VC is looking for

356
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,320
a CEO of the company who is a leader,

357
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,160
who can lead this opportunity.

358
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,875
A VC doesn't want to lead this thing,

359
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:37,200
like if I would be smart enough,

360
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,800
I would say no to the entrepreneurs.

361
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,760
I'm saying, "Guys, you know,

362
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,880
if I would know this better than you

363
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,960
so, I would probably start this company."

364
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,160
"Why am I investing here?"

365
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,880
"Because I trust you in your judgment."

366
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,720
So, I think that's the point.

367
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,320
You have to be,

368
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,480
there's a very thin border between,

369
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,200
very thin line between being stubborn

370
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,467
and kind of done next to being flexible,

371
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:11,760
then next is being

372
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,040
completely all over the place.

373
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,520
So, I would say this flexibility,

374
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,112
when you do know what you're doing

375
00:15:19,312 --> 00:15:20,608
and you do believe

376
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:22,480
in what the way you chose,

377
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,800
but you understand that you probably

378
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,560
do not know all the details

379
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,631
and there are other people

380
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:28,945
who have experienced

381
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:30,560
that you have to acknowledge.

382
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,960
So, that's the one that creates

383
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,800
the healthy conversations.

384
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,359
And, you know, sometimes VCs,

385
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,720
great VCs have wrong opinions.

386
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,850
You know, every great VC,

387
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:43,540
I'm not even so great,

388
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,793
have an anti-portfolio

389
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:50,475
where they missed a lot of good companies.

390
00:15:50,675 --> 00:15:52,880
So, that's them.

391
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,800
That's always happens.

392
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,880
Right, I think that almost every VC,

393
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,648
that every venture capital partner

394
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:02,828
that I met in Silicon Valley so far

395
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,677
has this crazy story of how

396
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:07,178
they passed on Airbnb or Lyft

397
00:16:07,378 --> 00:16:10,440
or one of those great companies

398
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,320
when they were young.

399
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,000
And now and then they're reflecting.

400
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,707
They're thinking,

401
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:15,160
"Okay, why did we missed them?"

402
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,239
And it's not like the VC knows everything

403
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:19,958
and that you're able to assess amazingly

404
00:16:20,158 --> 00:16:23,040
the validity of a company, you also miss.

405
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,520
A good friend of mine passed on Airbnb.

406
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,880
Yup, that's the reality.

407
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,720
Definitely.

408
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,160
Exactly.

409
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,802
Now, you have young entrepreneurs

410
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:38,120
that are looking to meet you, for example,

411
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,800
that are that are raising money,

412
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,320
what kind of advice

413
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,900
just seeing a lot of other companies

414
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,038
would you give them specifically saying

415
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,090
these are the things

416
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,240
that you should be focusing

417
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,960
in the early stages of your company.

418
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,983
Maybe it's to go full throttle on fundraising,

419
00:16:53,183 --> 00:16:54,720
or maybe it's to find some balance,

420
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,086
and how do they look

421
00:16:56,286 --> 00:16:57,320
for the right investors.

422
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,606
What are some things

423
00:16:58,806 --> 00:17:00,520
that you think are really important?

424
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,680
So, you know, I always,

425
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,000
always ask this question myself, as also,

426
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,900
you know, as the entrepreneur,

427
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,640
because I've raised money before

428
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,280
for my companies.

429
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,600
And hopefully if I start other companies,

430
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,000
I will probably raise money again.

431
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,600
So, it's hard to judge

432
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,520
from the position of the VC.

433
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,513
But I think, I'll speak of myself,

434
00:17:24,713 --> 00:17:28,066
when the entrepreneurs come to me

435
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:32,960
in their early stage, first of all,

436
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,760
I look for the acknowledgement

437
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,320
that they don't know everything.

438
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,259
When people come to me

439
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:44,120
and they start laying out a three year plan

440
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,718
with like details in this,

441
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:46,843
I'm like, whoa.

442
00:17:47,043 --> 00:17:49,520
"Guys, you haven't really started yet."

443
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,120
"How they know what's going to happen?"

444
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,200
And my point the answer is,

445
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,880
"We don't really know

446
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,937
but that's what we expect

447
00:17:57,137 --> 00:18:00,520
and that's what we're going to go for."

448
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,040
Right.

449
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,640
The idea is,

450
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
I want to see that the entrepreneur

451
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,800
thought through a lot of things really deeply

452
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,720
and they understand the challenges,

453
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,040
the problems and unknowns

454
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,640
that they have in the way.

455
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,675
Right. While keeping in mind

456
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,000
that they don't know everything.

457
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,440
Yeah, because that's exactly.

458
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,638
Because it's very strange to see

459
00:18:28,838 --> 00:18:30,560
an early stage company,

460
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,960
seed company comes to you and says,

461
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,303
"We're have this five pilots in three months,

462
00:18:36,503 --> 00:18:38,681
we're going to close those five clients

463
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:39,240
and so on."

464
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,800
So now, and so what happens

465
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,960
if you guys don't close?

466
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,733
So, I would say that they'd be realistic.

467
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:49,520
And being visionary,

468
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,120
but at the same time being realistic.

469
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,160
It's a lot of contradictory things.

470
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,525
It's something that kind of

471
00:18:54,725 --> 00:18:55,840
specifically speaks to me.

472
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,320
Right.

473
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,426
I think to me, it sounds like

474
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:00,978
you're looking for the visionary

475
00:19:01,178 --> 00:19:03,438
and having the humility of knowing that

476
00:19:03,638 --> 00:19:05,720
while you might be a visionary,

477
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,080
it's quite possible being visionary

478
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
doesn't contradict being open minded.

479
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,838
Understanding that the vision can change

480
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:13,200
according to the circumstances.

481
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,720
Right now you have the information X,

482
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,453
already have X plus Y,

483
00:19:17,653 --> 00:19:19,520
that's a new world right there.

484
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,900
Now you have to be visionary again

485
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:21,640
and reinvent yourself.

486
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,040
I know very important,

487
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:29,246
the crucial thing is just know your stuff.

488
00:19:29,446 --> 00:19:32,030
Meaning, when you speak to a CEO

489
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,735
that gives you the product, it usually happens

490
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:38,040
when the CEO is a product person,

491
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,000
not really a business person.

492
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,848
You have a really deep conversation

493
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,360
about the product and what it does

494
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,150
and what we'll do,

495
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,960
envision how it's going to change the world

496
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,280
that can change everything.

497
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,840
I want to get to the card numbers and just,

498
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,781
okay, so let's talk about

499
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:53,400
how we can make it happen.

500
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,960
That's when it starts, you know,

501
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,440
Oh, this is like my other co-founder did hat,

502
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,040
and I don't know this number.

503
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,880
You don't have to know everything,

504
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,173
but you have to be able to operate

505
00:20:05,373 --> 00:20:08,400
your excels and your financials,

506
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,320
like the way you're actually

507
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,680
that you have it in your mind.

508
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,816
So that's what gives you confidence

509
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:22,000
about the CEO and about the co-founders.

510
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,720
I think there is a growing misconception,

511
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,515
almost that people believe that

512
00:20:26,715 --> 00:20:29,244
they're coming in for an interview.

513
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:31,178
Like the VC is going to ask them

514
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:32,390
as if it's on Shark Tank,

515
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,095
they're going to ask them for these numbers

516
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:36,034
and they're testing their memory

517
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,600
to see whether they're serious or not.

518
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,840
But that's not how it works.

519
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,499
When you ask somebody for a number

520
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,222
or like a forecast for something,

521
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:44,303
it's not to test

522
00:20:44,503 --> 00:20:46,159
whether they memorize the number.

523
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,680
It's an actual question.

524
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,258
And if they give off a vibe

525
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,240
that they're not owning the information,

526
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,600
that they don't understand the process of,

527
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,440
that maybe the other co-founder has done.

528
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,200
It's fine that they did the work.

529
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,920
But you need to understand the process

530
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,080
and be able to take ownership of it

531
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,840
if you're representing the company.

532
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,440
And so, I think that

533
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,280
that is an interesting element.

534
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
Yeah, that's a great element.

535
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,140
And it's just important because

536
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,480
exactly what you said you want to see,

537
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,509
like you want to understand this number.

538
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:17,200
Like, here's a VC, as a person

539
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,000
who's done business yourself,

540
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,033
you understand that

541
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:21,652
there is a very high probability

542
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:23,792
that those numbers aren't correct

543
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,320
for all different reasons.

544
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,440
That you want to understand

545
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,628
that the person understands

546
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:30,407
how this actually forms,

547
00:21:30,607 --> 00:21:31,920
how that comes to life.

548
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,445
And if the person understands that,

549
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:35,763
then you can say,

550
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,760
okay, this guy actually knows what to expect

551
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,160
and he'll be able to react.

552
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,640
Right.

553
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,560
So, that's what you want to do.

554
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,280
Exactly.

555
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,080
I love it.

556
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,800
Levy, this has been so much fun.

557
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,480
Unfortunately we have to end.

558
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,640
20 minutes are over.

559
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,520
But I have the most important question,

560
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,464
which is three words that you would use

561
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:56,560
to describe yourself.

562
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,840
I've been waiting for that.

563
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,647
So, first of all,

564
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:03,951
thanks for giving me a heads up for this.

565
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:07,320
I've been actually able to think about it.

566
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,880
So, I would say that

567
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,277
I think when I think about myself,

568
00:22:15,477 --> 00:22:18,040
I'm thinking about curiosity.

569
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:25,640
I happen to be a very I would say,

570
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,141
what's the word, the English,

571
00:22:29,668 --> 00:22:35,480
I don't like following the herd,

572
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,440
I don't like following the crowd.

573
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,880
Yeah.

574
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,646
And the last thing I would say,

575
00:22:41,846 --> 00:22:43,560
I'm probably pretty entrepreneurial,

576
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,532
which sometimes actually

577
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:49,179
is a negative to be a VC

578
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,800
because you get too passionate about things.

579
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,680
And instead of cold mind outside,

580
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,880
you become one of the hard brained inside.

581
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,240
Levy, thank you so much.

582
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,080
This is really great.

583
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,640
Toda raba. Stay safe and stay healthy

584
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,520
until this craziness is over.

585
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:11,360
Yeah. Let us all come out of it

586
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,080
better and stronger

587
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,480
and healthier people.

588
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,016
May God help us all.

589
00:23:17,216 --> 00:23:22,080
Just to stay safe through all this.

590
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,040
Thanks. Thanks for having me.
