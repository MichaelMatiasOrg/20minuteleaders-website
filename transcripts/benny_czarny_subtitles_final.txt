All right. Benny Czarny, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Michael, thanks for having me. Benny, I just want to hear about your journey. It's very rare to meet a founder that bootstrapped a company from their living room as an engineer and grew it to over a thousand customers. Some of the most notable companies that we all know here in the US. But more importantly, you're providing cyber security systems for 98% of the US nuclear facilities. Is that right? That's correct. Actually that's just one example. So we protect, our mission is to protect critical infrastructure. I mean, yes, nuclear facility is one of that. That's one testimony of our success however we do everything. We do government, we do manufacturing, agriculture, utilities, other energies. It's not only nuclear, there is also renewable with solar. There is tons. Benny, I'm starting with the most important question. Do you sleep at night? I mean seriously, aren't you scared about what you're doing? This is crazy. Actually I sleep really well at night. ... rare occasions that I don't sleep well at night. I like to sleep well at night. Wonderful. Okay, Benny, take me back. Take me back to the founding days of OPSWAT. How does it start? And what is your strategy in building this company which now is huge, huge success? Great. Thank you. So, how it started? So, it all started with an idea and a vision. Everything starts there. So, also talk to your other person. What do you want to do? So, you want to go, I mean, I knew, I mean actually if you ask me when I was I think it was sixth grade, what you gonna do? I could tell you "I'm gonna go and build a cyber security company" When I was six, I went, and then it was funny. Actually I still have a childhood friend who I still ... and we're still fighting, "Oh I'm gonna have a better company" "I'm gonna have a better company" "I'm gonna have a better company" It's still happening by the way. He also, he founded, he ended up founding another company in civil engineering and we are still having that today. Amazing. Our wives are laughing at us. Amazing. Okay. So, you have this vision. You have this strategy. You're gonna build a cyber security company, but you do it in a very unorthodox way because today cyber, every, you know, engineer out of 8200 wants to build a cyber security company, raises a ten million dollars seed, goes to series A, and sells it for $200 million. You did something else. Yeah. So what I did, I bootstrapped it. So, I start with first the goal. What was the global mission? I said, "Hey, okay Let's see what do I have here?" And when I started the company, it was 2002. I knew, okay fine, I'm gonna go and put something together. I'm gonna go and do it and I'm gonna make it. Could I have raised money in 2002? Yes, I could. If I wanted to, I would focus on that. I found myself much more battling between selling the products to customers willing to already use the product and appreciate it, to spending my time actually talking to the investors. And then at some point I said, "You know what? I'm gonna go and try taking the hard way and then go all the way without anything else." It's not like I invested capital. So initially what I did, I provide some professional services, not in that area, in other. And I used that fund of professional services to hire engineers to go and build the product. I start eventually with one. After that one became two, two became four, four became eight, and so on and so on. Wow. So, there is no institutional funding throughout the lifetime of OPSWAT? No, not yet, no. Unbelievable. Okay. Now, talk to me a little bit about about the journey. So, now you have over a thousand customers. You are handling over 98% of the nuclear facilities in the US. How do you get to a level where you're building the trust where the US government is letting you defend its most critical infrastructure? I mean that sounds, to me that sounds like the highest level you can get to as a cybersecurity company. So it's all depends ... my three operating principles. Number one is the technology. Be committed to the technology. Yeah. I would hope so. Number two is very much the people on the team. It's all about the people. The company's not me, it's the team. It's everything about the team that is being built. Their motivation, their aspiration. What do they do. Whatever they kind of, whatever we think. Whatever they go and what keeps them up is how to make sure the product is competitive. The product is doing what it's supposed to do. We are very transparent about the product. How? From end to end. From marketing through how the product is operating. And three, go to market. The channel. The how we go and very much selling the product that are out there. How we reach out to these folks that really needs it. Right. So, how many people are involved in this right now with OPSWAT? The company we are at 321 employees today. Incredible. And growing. Actually we have 30 open positions. Despite the corona we are hiring. 30 open positions? Yes. So you're looking to grow 10% during covid-19? Yes, we are. Yes, we are. We are not, I mean, critically I'm talking to our customers. I'm talking to customers in anywhere. They are going to the office. So ... Most of our customers, we still have some customers end of the day we are building a great product. We have some awesome nontraditional, critical infrastructure companies buying our solutions. So, they are not bank. They are not energy, and they're not utility ... because we have a good product. However most of our customers are actually going to the office. Incredible. Okay. So you know, I have quite a few friends who have either lost their internship or lost their job offer because things have gone awry. So definitely, this sounds great. But Benny, talk to me a little bit about the cyber security space. I want your earned secrets over these years of building OPSWAT. You're dealing with some of the most incredible companies. And you really are an expert in the cyber security field simply because you've been selling in the field and you've been developing cutting edge technology there. What is the cybersecurity space today like in the world, and what are the biggest challenges that we're heading towards? If you're looking at the cybersecurity from that perspective, it's very segregated. I mean, if I'm looking at company, very segregated. I see very very good companies, however sometimes they're doing just one point solution. They create a very good e-mail security, a really good antivirus, or a different point solution. And if you're looking at the cyber map you see like more than 3,000 cybersecurity companies out there. Maybe 500 are in Israel and then you have like So ... see that. So, what is missing from that perspective? So, what's unique about us is very much a critical infrastructure protection. It's a holistic view on critical infrastructure. We have two platforms that helps you not only prevent spreads, also create a process. So, whenever we research cyber security attacks, it's all about it's not only about okay defending, it's also creating a process. We go to ... to IT managers. We ask them, "Who is bringing data? Who is bringing devices? What type of data? Do you have a policy?" You'll be surprised that there is no single answer, and we are there to go and solve this problem. Another operating principle that I've seen is that, there is not enough education system. So, there is no training. There is no official training. There could be a training for a product, though there is no training for the problem and what you're trying to achieve. So, on that also, you have for example we invest a lot in, we call it ... So it's all about training the IT folks for the critical infrastructure. Now, I don't want to promote it to be here just to promote, use this time just to promote the company, though you asked me about how I see the cyber security market. So I find very segregated, very point focused, very product focused, not so much solution focused. Obviously you have the big folks. You have the Check Point of the world, you have the Palo Alto of the world. You have the Cisco of the world, and they say, "Oh we do everything in cybersecurity." So this is more the military. You need cyber security, you get the military. And then you have the point solution that is more of the products folks that something that the company's doing something specific, something's very good or a one thing or sometimes two things that they are repeating and getting in the cybersecurity field. Benny, it sounds to me, I'm coming from the cyber security space myself. But one of the things that I learned quickly in my time in 8200 is that this world is changing constantly. It's a cat and mouse game and new things are coming up all the time. New technologies for every new device. And you know, today our fans are connected. And I believe one of them, really mind changing moments that I had was back in my course in the Army. And we had a guest speaker who came in and showed us a paper that they wrote in the Technion of how a ceiling fan can actually transmit data that you wouldn't expect it to. And I was thinking to myself, "A ceiling fan can give me information, critical information, about about whatever is happening" And I thought that was crazy. So how do you manage that new knowledge that is constantly being creating? Because you're only relevant as long as you're up to date with what's happening. You have to be ahead of everybody else in the game, right? So, that's a good one. So, for that, we keep innovating. So, to a point that we keep having new product. So, by the way, during the covid-19, we released three new products. So to a point that we are doing it. So I completely agree with you. It keeps changing. The threats landscape keep changing, though there's something else interesting that I've seen in cyber security. Sometimes it's revolving. So what you've seen that, something that was happening 10 years ago is coming back to life sometimes. And you see it for example with data loss prevention or some other technologies that are keeping reinventing themselves. And the reason for that is that the IT is changing. And then security needs to catch up with the new IT threat. So, for example, mobile phone, for example, IOT devices ... So the reason for that is ... what we do, how we interact. Work from home, for example, it's a different attack vector for both productivity and security, right. Of course. So that's and now with the covid that will accelerate activities and productivities. ... Interesting. Okay. And how do you create a culture, though, where people are interested in learning? So instead of just continuing to develop the current software, they're continuing to research and understand what else is happening. Do you deploy that through a specific division that is responsible for new key findings or for learning, or do you collaborate with academia and universities to see what they're coming up with? How do you maintain number one in the game? Okay so there are multiple answers for it. Number one is our customer landscape. We have so many deployments, actually it's over 1500 customers to be precise. So we have lots of customers and lots of probes out there. Every customer who deploy our product in multiple. Our products, some of them has, I mean, you can enable sensors to go and understand what's happening there. And with customers if they elect to share their threats with us, we get a lot of data from first our customers and they see what's happening. Number two, we have our own big data analysis. So, big data analysis we have ... from the cloud you can go and share data there. And ... from the cloud we have tons of users. We have a whole community of voters there just talking about. Number three, we have a model sharing program with very much almost every antivirus out there. So whenever, for example, ... Symantec, McAfee, all of these folks that are finding a threat. We are obliged to go and share threats with each other. So we research that. - Okay And another thing that I'm seeing, by the way, in the cyber that is related to that is that, also related to the philosophy and also a bit about our success, is our technology philosophy's surely zero ... So we assume all of the files are bad so we generate them. So, however, that's another kind of operating philosophy. And we tested moving landscape and the moving targets and the moving threats to our ... I love it. Benny, I wanna move a little bit to the entrepreneurial journey and leadership. And I'd love to know, the traditional path that I see here is in the Valley and Tel Aviv is that, you go, you raise institutional funding and you move quickly. And when you get to ring the bell at NASDAQ like Lemonade is doing today, even though this is going to be shown to the public later on, but today Lemonade is going public. That's sort of the lifetime dream of any entrepreneur. It doesn't seem like that is necessarily your ambition and your dream. What is your consideration for keeping the company private rather than public? And do you ever see yourself going on to something else? So, back to your question, actually no there is a chance we'll go either public or ... or could be a big exit to could be a big merger with something, however I don't operate this way. First, I build the company to last. I build the company and it last with a good culture, with a good team, with a good management team, with a good business. That's kind of where I get. What's in for the employees? Everything. First, the equity that I provide to the team members is much better than diluting it with some VC folks right now. And I can show you the numbers. And whenever I keep asking I don't look at the quantity of the stocks, look at their value that we're bringing in the case of an exit. Right. So, I have team members with stock or stock options depends on their situation in that. And I believe that at some point, ... whether we decide to go to the IPO route, or we decide to get the bottom with the private equity to go and get it which is another option. I built the company to last not to - I think, I mean, that's the most inspiring part. You're building the company to last. I think right now, especially what I'm seeing with a lot of my colleagues in my age group is that you're not thinking about a company that you're gonna be involved with for 10, 15, 20 years. You think about products that you're gonna be excited to work on for a year or two and then sell or move on to your next project which is a very different mindset. Benny, you moved from managing one person yourself basically to now managing over 300 people in this great company. What have you learned over the years or what surprised you over things that you didn't expect? So it's cool. Initially I was very much everything. I was the bagel guy, I was the coder. I was pretty much the HR, the everything around it. And then slowly get the management team, a professional management team in place. The right system in place. The banking systems in place to go and put it together to a point that it's And I see this journey ... challenging me from okay, from doing ... and it's actually changing my kind of my day to day. And I find it very fascinating. I love it. So I find myself as building careers and building careers inside the company. I tell my executive these two things. You have two honorable ways you're gonna leave the company. Two honorable ways. Option one, you die. It's honorable, right? You die. Option number two, go open your own company. Right. And by the way, it worked with two executives. Two past executives. I mean, they didn't die, they opened their own companies. Amazing. Successful? What I would like to see you come over here. We work together as a team. And after that, build your experience and after five years, they went, they built their own company. I'm still in touch with them. Great. This is what I call an honorable way. I love it. Benny, what would be the most important thing for you that if I were to ask any of your 300 employees, I tell them, tell me one the best thing about Benny. What would they tell me about your leadership style? Because I'm getting information for myself. I wanna be an entrepreneur myself one day or continue being an entrepreneur and create my own company. And I'm thinking, what are the most important traits that I need to maintain or uphold as a leader? Okay. So, I'm personable. So whenever I'm connecting I'm connecting with you. Talk to me. So, I'm very personable with it. I'm very direct too. Say, "Hey, I hate it. I like it. I think you are not on it" And I think that when you match that with the personable, then, they don't take it personally because you care for them. The feedback you're giving them is not against them. It's perhaps critical, it's perhaps criticism over the work, but because you build this personal trust, then it's much more meaningful to be direct, right? Yeah. So, that's on this one. I'm direct and so on. And then, I like to ask, "Why? What's in it for you?" on ... point. Also I like to understand what they like to do, what they don't like to do. People, usually they are good. Usually, not always. They are good at what they like to do. Right. So, that's kind and they like to take jobs at things that they're good at, and I'm trying to just ensure it's there and to provide. I have managers that have been with me for many years in the Silicon Valley, which is tough. I have managers with me for over 12 years and there is one ... gonna go and retire, an executive gonna retire from the company. I see it all. That's I look at it as an accomplishment. Incredible. I mean I think it's amazing that you're looking at that as a source of accomplishment for the company. I don't think that many founders and leaders would see that as such a great accomplishment. Obviously it is but I think just their focus may be on other things. But it sounds like you're putting the team first which I think is so so cool. What is it about, though, the culture that's making them want to stay for so long? Because opportunities here are endless. There's constant competition for the best talent, especially coming out of a great company like yours. So, what do you think makes people want to remain strong within a company like OPSWAT? So number one is our mission, right You want to identify yourself with the mission, a company that really helps somebody, right? So you're not gonna go and Again there are some people, you're not ... you're doing good, you're not doing something bad or perceived to be bad by some. So, there is very pure mission. Number two, the commitment of the company to the technology and the product, something that is thriving good people. Yes, we want to create a great product. What I want the guy to, if there's something bothering them, ... what's gonna be the customer experience. Definitely. End of the day, I would like the team members to think about the company and people like that. They are connecting to it. Right. And they're transparent culture. So, the team members, they know. Okay, we make the numbers. What's that. We usually make the numbers and then we usually exceed them. So, it's very transparent. And also it's also keeping a message of success. No no, I think that is - ... which also tells about a lot of predictions. So whenever we are providing a forecast, not only to ourself, also to our vendors. And also, internally, to sales team members, and to product managers. We like to be very honest with the numbers and very honest with ourself and very transparent to ourself. And then if you can put together a forecast ... it there. Right, and that I think something is that a lot of young entrepreneurs need to uphold that and learn especially in today's age. Benny, before we leave 20 minutes go by so fast. I wanna thank you for your time and your generosity. We know each other from J-Ventures and it's been great working over there. And we met in person right before the start of Corona and I look forward to seeing you again in person in the monthly meetings after Corona. But before we leave, I need three words that best describe you. Oh. The hardest question. And you're asking me to describe myself? Usually I'm gonna ask you, "Hey, go ask others what they say about me." So, you know what? I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna ask If I were to ask any of your 300 employees or your 1500 customers, who is Benny? What are the three characteristics that he is most representative as? Okay so he's a definitely a builder, a builder of technology and an innovator. So, definitely I would say that. Very much kind of innovated platform that it's not like another category out there in the market that is successful and working. A career builder I would say. Building careers, and then and also, career builder as well. I would say that. I would, I think I can stand behind that and provide - It definitely sounds like it. The third one, ouch. You know I think that it's amazing that you're thinking critically about this because a lot of people they know immediately and they're saying like these interview questions. But I think that you're so humble and you're really, you're thinking about the 300 people that you have and your building this great great company. And it exudes from this conversation how you're putting so much focus on the career building and the success of your customers and the success of others along with you. You're not just thinking about how can I make it the biggest, but how can I build a culture and how can I build a team that is really proud of what we're doing. And I think that that speaks for itself. So I'm gonna be great with two words with that description at the end. So and I really wanna thank you for this inspiration, really. Thank you Michael for the opportunity to speak here. I appreciate your time. Of course. No, thank you. And I'm gonna reach back of course when I have my own venture, and I can't wait to work together in the future. I'm looking forward to it. Take care. Bye Benny. Toda raba.
