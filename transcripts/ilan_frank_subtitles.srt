1
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,960
Wonderful. Okay.

2
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,960
Awesome.

3
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,800
Okay. We're back.

4
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,400
We're back in business, the same place.

5
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,040
Ilan, what are the earned secrets

6
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,640
that over these 20 years,

7
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,080
if you go back 20 years,

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,960
what would you tell young Ilan?

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,840
With regards to enterprise software,

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,000
it's really important

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,640
to focus on the end users.

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,240
This is something that

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,680
we didn't know 20 years ago.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,320
It's maybe a little bit more obvious now,

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:10,920
but that's something

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,560
that's critically important.

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,040
I think what's more relevant now,

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,080
which is interesting,

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,640
is that everyone seems to know

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,800
that the enterprise software also

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,200
has to be designed well.

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,320
And, adoption metrics

23
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,680
have to be taken into consideration.

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,720
But we have seem to forget the fact

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,720
that enterprise software still

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,240
has something different from consumer,

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,480
which is, enterprise software,

28
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,520
has a user and a chooser.

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,440
And it is important.

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,440
The chooser is the person

31
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,920
who makes the budget decisions,

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,560
the person who makes

33
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,400
the buying decisions.

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,960
It is important to consider them

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,120
in product management

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,560
just as much as the end user.

37
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,130
Why is that?

38
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,240
So, if I buy, I have a sales cycle.

39
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,400
I go to the enterprise.

40
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,160
I pitch to the director who has

41
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,400
the authority to sign of

42
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,760
on a hundred thousand dollar license.

43
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,160
And, but the users are the team players

44
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,680
who at the end are the ones running around

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,920
and using my software

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,680
for whatever they're doing.

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,280
Right.

48
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,400
So, the dynamic is that in this day,

49
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,560
enterprise software is more coming up,

50
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,440
sorry, from the bottom up

51
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,800
rather than top down.

52
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,720
So, rather than CIO making a decision

53
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,080
and saying,

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,960
"Everyone is going to use this."

55
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,800
Enterprise software is actually

56
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,400
being found by those ICs,

57
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,680
those individual contributors

58
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,440
that have the jobs, and they want

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,720
to be more productive at work.

60
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,080
They're looking for tools

61
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,760
to make them more productive at work.

62
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,680
So, that's why it's important

63
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,360
to focus on the end user.

64
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,400
But, and a lot of

65
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,800
enterprise software companies,

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,280
of course, like Slack, are doing so.

67
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,160
But it's important at the same time,

68
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,960
one of the things that people

69
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,360
maybe don't realize about Slack

70
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,360
is that we focus equally on the top down.

71
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,080
What is it going to be important

72
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,800
for the enterprise buyer.

73
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,240
And for Slack

74
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,560
and for productivity tool specifically,

75
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,720
that is productivity and innovation.

76
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,400
What are the tools that are going to help

77
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,440
my employees transform themselves

78
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,440
to be more productive,

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,760
to be more innovative.

80
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,640
Going back to that,

81
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,760
because it's fascinating to me.

82
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,640
What you're saying is that,

83
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,040
there has been a trend changing,

84
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,200
that if previously

85
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,920
you go to the ICO of the company, the CIO

86
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,320
and you go and you pitch a product

87
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,680
and you get them to buy into it,

88
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,840
and then from top down

89
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,240
they disseminated into their

90
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,000
thousand employees or so.

91
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,720
Today, you're going after

92
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,880
the team players.

93
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,120
And if they love your product,

94
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,560
they'll start adopting it

95
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,880
throughout the organization

96
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,760
until there's no point but to actually

97
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,960
get it custom for the organization, right?

98
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,600
That's right.

99
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:43,920
That's right.

100
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,920
And then, it bubbles up into the CIO.

101
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,080
The CIO sees it.

102
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,000
It's known maybe

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,760
as shadow IT at this point.

104
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,040
And now, you want to

105
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,040
use an enterprise software company

106
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,840
you want to sell to the CIO.

107
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,000
This is when the CIO

108
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,280
is going to look for different things.

109
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,520
Their requirements

110
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,680
are very very different

111
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,000
from the end users.

112
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,800
Certainly they want their end users

113
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,600
to be productive.

114
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,960
But they also have to look

115
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,640
after beyond cost.

116
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,440
They have to look after compliance,

117
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,080
security, administration, performance.

118
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,920
Those are the things

119
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,240
that really matter to them

120
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,920
when they're shopping for software.

121
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,120
So, you have to make sure

122
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,760
that your product

123
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,320
also addresses these needs.

124
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,840
Fascinating.

125
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,000
So, it sounds to me like

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,440
you're almost developing two products.

127
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,880
Because even, let's look at Slack

128
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,560
as a collaboration tool, on one hand,

129
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,000
you have the end user, which is myself.

130
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,280
I love sharing my files.

131
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,480
I love all the marketplace

132
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,360
with integrations.

133
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,360
My life is nothing like it was

134
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
five years ago.

135
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,640
If I had Slack in high school,

136
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,480
my high school would look

137
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,200
extremely different than it does now.

138
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,960
Because now, it's incredible.

139
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,760
I'll just say that it's incredible.

140
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,560
But, there's all of this

141
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,960
in compliance and security

142
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,080
that I'm not even aware of.

143
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,520
For example, I work at Hippo

144
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,400
and I don't really know what security

145
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,720
goes behind the scenes to make sure that

146
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,360
the data that I pass along is secured.

147
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,760
But I'm sure that my CIO

148
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,000
knows it very well, right?

149
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,440
Right. Exactly.

150
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,080
That sounds incredible.

151
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,840
That's exactly right.

152
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,600
And early on in Slack,

153
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,560
we actually did that.

154
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,560
We actually, and I've spoken

155
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,320
to many enterprise software companies

156
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,640
that are starting up,

157
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,280
and given this advice is that early on

158
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,320
we actually separated

159
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,360
our product management into self-service

160
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,720
and into enterprise.

161
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,000
And the self-service part

162
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,680
of product management really focused

163
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,280
on metrics like adaption,

164
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,440
usage of different app features, NPS,

165
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,960
and satisfaction of end users,

166
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,000
the love of the product and all that.

167
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,040
In the enterprise side,

168
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,920
the side that I led,

169
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,240
focus exclusively on making sure

170
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,520
that new industries, new geographies

171
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,200
can actually obtain this software.

172
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,280
Each one has a different

173
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,960
set of compliance requirements,

174
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,920
security requirements,

175
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,680
administration requirements.

176
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,520
So, that's how we looked at the market

177
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,600
in a very different lens.

178
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,720
But Ilan, your colleague has the luxury

179
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,600
of having data from millions of users

180
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,560
getting NPS scores through logic,

181
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,680
through the usage.

182
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,760
You're coming in and you have a handful

183
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,360
of large customers that you're trying

184
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
to get information,

185
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,200
from how do you get an NPS score

186
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,840
from those individuals

187
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,120
who are buying the software.

188
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,420
Because every product costumer

189
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,600
that I ever talked, they told us,

190
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,000
"Your customers don't know what they want."

191
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,040
"Ask them what they need."

192
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,160
Right?

193
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,840
So, how do you go about that?

194
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,160
Because your metric is their satisfaction.

195
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,080
Yeah, that's right.

196
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,160
So, by the way, that phrase

197
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,640
that you just quoted

198
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,120
has many times been misconstrued,

199
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,480
especially recently.

200
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,200
And I want to make sure

201
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,320
that people listening to this that are

202
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,600
starting enterprise software companies,

203
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,440
understand that,

204
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,160
yes, that is true.

205
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,280
That customers don't necessarily know

206
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,240
the solution.

207
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,560
They will ask for something

208
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,680
that sounds like the solution.

209
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,120
But what you need to do as a good PM

210
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,640
is to bring them back to the problem.

211
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,360
State the problem, and then your job

212
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,120
is to come up with a solution.

213
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,840
But a lot of people

214
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,080
misinterpret that statement

215
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,120
that you had, to the customers

216
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,160
don't know what they want.

217
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,560
I know better what they want.

218
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,920
I will go and build something

219
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,360
without talking to them.

220
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,280
That is not the right strategy

221
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
and will not work.

222
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,960
So, the answer to your question,

223
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,120
it's a really good question.

224
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,880
With enterprise software, it's different.

225
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,960
You can't do a broad survey.

226
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,320
So, quant work is not going to really work

227
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,280
because you just don't have

228
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,680
that many data points.

229
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,480
Exactly.

230
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,080
But you can certainly go

231
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,440
and talk to people.

232
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,080
So, the first thing that I recommend

233
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,080
for enterprise software company

234
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,200
product managers to do

235
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,320
is to set up a CAB.

236
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,360
A customer advisory board.

237
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,600
Bring in your top 20 customers,

238
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,240
meet with them on a regular basis.

239
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,160
Once every quarter, once every six months,

240
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,000
whatever makes sense for you.

241
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,160
Present to them.

242
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,080
What we do with our CABs

243
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,440
and what we've done since

244
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,880
really four years ago when I joined Slack,

245
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,560
is we meet regularly.

246
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,040
We present the road map,

247
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,200
and get their feedback

248
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,960
on what we are showing.

249
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,640
We have special sections.

250
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,240
The next section of the CAB,

251
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,800
it's a one day session usually.

252
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,080
The next section is really to talk about

253
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,120
three different drill-down areas,

254
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,600
areas that we're planning on invest

255
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,280
in recently or in the near future.

256
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,400
And we really want to get their input on

257
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,720
to drill-down into specifics.

258
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
And then, the last section is really

259
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,240
for them to talk to us

260
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,280
and hear their feedback

261
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,680
and to talk to one another.

262
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,600
So, the best part of the of that day

263
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,880
a lot of times is just having them

264
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,280
talk to us and again to each other,

265
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,720
about things that are working,

266
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,760
things that are not working,

267
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,440
things that they've tried,

268
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,560
and learning from one another.

269
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,440
And we learn from them as well.

270
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,180
One of the best parts of the day.

271
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,440
Are these pro-users in the sense that

272
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,840
do they love Slack?

273
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,360
Or, is that something

274
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,280
that's common among all of them?

275
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,360
Or, are some of them

276
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,680
a little bit more hesitant?

277
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,520
So, in this case, these are all people,

278
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,200
that's not a criteria that I use.

279
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,760
It's not a litmus test that I use

280
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,560
for getting people on the CAB or not.

281
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,480
They happen to mostly love Slack

282
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,400
because they are responsible

283
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,440
for rolling it out in their organization.

284
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,000
One thing that is important to remember

285
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,960
in enterprise software is that,

286
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,760
those admins, they're your champions.

287
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,840
Those admins, the people that are

288
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,120
working with your software

289
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,600
and managing your software.

290
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,880
They've staked their career

291
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,960
on the success of your product

292
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,960
because that's their career.

293
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,120
And so, it's important to listen to them.

294
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,680
It's important to treat them well.

295
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,400
And so, they do mostly love Slack.

296
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,240
They are mostly champions.

297
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,360
But that's not what I, yeah,

298
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,320
I don't ask that question.

299
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,880
Ilan, what happens

300
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,960
when there's a clash?

301
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,000
There's a clash because

302
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,640
you have road map for enterprise,

303
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,480
your colleague has a road map

304
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,960
for the self serve,

305
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,520
there's a finite resources

306
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,760
as in any organization,

307
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,960
and now you have to make some decisions.

308
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,000
How do you quantify the impact

309
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,160
of these two fields which are connected

310
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,360
but disconnected?

311
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,160
Yeah. A lot of it is art

312
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,200
more than science.

313
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,320
Especially when you're talking about

314
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,720
enterprise to enterprise.

315
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,760
Security to admin, it's pretty easy.

316
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,120
Right?

317
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,160
You just look at the TAM,

318
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,560
or the revenue impacted,

319
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,040
or the pipeline that's blocked

320
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,760
based on the features.

321
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,560
We have reports that show us exactly

322
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,080
how much pipeline is associated

323
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,720
with these big security features

324
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,560
or big administration features.

325
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,160
That's easy on the retail side.

326
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,840
It's also pretty easy because the numbers,

327
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,320
the metrics tell you where to invest.

328
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,600
We have a lot of experiments

329
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,280
that we run there

330
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,320
and see which one proves

331
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,560
to be better enterprise. To reach out

332
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,120
is a little bit more difficult.

333
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,880
And for that, what we've done is,

334
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,720
we have company priorities.

335
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,240
There are always somehow, there are three,

336
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,400
that there are three company priorities.

337
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,440
And you're your initiative

338
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,040
similar to a company pitching to a VC.

339
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,480
We pitch internally.

340
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,280
And it has to align

341
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,800
to one of these three initiatives.

342
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,640
And if it does, then those are the teams

343
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,720
that get the resources for the year.

344
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,830
So so cool.

345
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,800
I'm so upset that were

346
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,720
more than halfway through.

347
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,680
Because every question that you answer,

348
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,440
I have 10 more questions that I wanna ask.

349
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,360
I'll try to keep them short.

350
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,640
No no. This has been perfect.

351
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,160
Please don't.

352
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,800
Ilan, looking back now,

353
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,560
or actually looking forward,

354
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,080
we can't avoid the fact

355
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,800
that we're in the global pandemic

356
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,840
and the world has changed forever.

357
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,160
And our workforce has changed forever.

358
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,240
I'd love your take on where are we headed

359
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,160
in terms of collaborative tools,

360
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,760
productivity, as the world is shifting

361
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,920
more and more towards remote collaboration

362
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,680
either Slack or off Slack.

363
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,920
How do you perceive

364
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,680
our collaborative nature digitally

365
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,360
as the years are going to go for it?

366
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,200
Yeah. Well, so, it's certain that this,

367
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,080
we're not going to go back

368
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,200
to whatever normal was.

369
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,760
I do think that the office

370
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,960
is not a thing of the past.

371
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,160
We will have offices again.

372
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,720
We will all be in offices.

373
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,960
It will be slightly different.

374
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,480
I think we've all realized that people

375
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,320
can actually just be

376
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,420
just as productive at home

377
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,520
as they can on the office,

378
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,920
minus taking care of kids and all that.

379
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,760
But we'll go to a world

380
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,320
where kids are at school

381
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,040
and parents can work.

382
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,080
But I think that the thing that is,

383
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,720
that the trend that we've seen,

384
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,000
and this happened before covid by the way,

385
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,960
is that responsibility and authority

386
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,720
for decision making is brought down

387
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,480
the org chart, right?

388
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,880
It used to be that decisions went up.

389
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,080
And they were made at the top.

390
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,640
And then, those orders came down.

391
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,360
But that's, it's almost reversed.

392
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,120
Decisions are being made in teams.

393
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,880
And what's important for executives

394
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,520
is now to understand all the decisions

395
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,320
that are being made,

396
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,360
so they can better align

397
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,280
and guide the team.

398
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,960
And that's a healthy thing.

399
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,360
That's good for large organizations

400
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,200
to function that way.

401
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,600
And I see in my work with organizations

402
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,960
that are transforming themselves,

403
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,360
that more and more of them

404
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,920
are working to that.

405
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,760
But I think that that is,

406
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,720
now that kind of reverse information flow

407
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,720
is a new area

408
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,640
that's going to be explored with tools.

409
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,880
I don't think that that's an area

410
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,560
that really has been explored

411
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,360
with enterprise software.

412
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,880
That is so so cool.

413
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,760
Okay. And now, 20 years later,

414
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,120
you're still in enterprise software,

415
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,040
collaborative tools, productivity tools,

416
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,720
where are you going to go

417
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,800
into your 21st year?

418
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,320
I mean, what does it do for you

419
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,560
that you're in this unique space

420
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,160
and in your unique position?

421
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah. I'll tell you.

422
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,840
And I don't mean

423
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,000
to bring this back to Slack.

424
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,120
We can talk about other things.

425
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,480
But specifically, four years ago

426
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,440
when I joined Slack

427
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,800
and I went and visited my first customer,

428
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,560
and it's a large bank

429
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,200
in the East Coast.

430
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,840
And I met with an employee there.

431
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,160
And she told me,

432
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,400
"I love my job more

433
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,480
because I use Slack."

434
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,800
Not, I love Slack.

435
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,120
Which would also be great to hear.

436
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,840
And I hear that a lot.

437
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,440
But I love my job.

438
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm here nine to five.

439
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,120
I enjoy what I do day to day more

440
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,320
because of this tool.

441
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,280
I'm happier here.

442
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
When you can have that kind of effect

443
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,640
on most of the waking hours of a person,

444
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,920
their time away from their family,

445
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,360
that is rewarding.

446
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,120
That's a mission

447
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,640
that I'm happy to get behind.

448
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,040
Slack is just one example of companies

449
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,440
that are doing things like that.

450
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,600
Making people's lives easier

451
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,800
and better at work.

452
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,760
And are you, is it more in the fact

453
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,880
that you're more curious

454
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,480
about enterprise software

455
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,000
that you decided to focus on that space?

456
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,320
Or, do you see yourself

457
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,320
ever shifting to the self serve?

458
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,480
I get it.

459
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,400
I get enterprise software,

460
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,240
I don't get consumer software.

461
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,600
You build something,

462
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,200
and then either someone likes it.

463
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,720
Like you need a 14 year old

464
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,840
to like your product

465
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,080
and then all of a sudden,

466
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,280
other people like it.

467
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,240
I don't get that world.

468
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,920
I definitely get enterprise software.

469
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,830
I love it. I love it.

470
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,440
Okay. Ilan, give me the broad picture

471
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,160
of collaborative tools.

472
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,600
Are we all moving more to

473
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,000
real time communication,

474
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,360
multiple integrations?

475
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,600
Because it seems to me,

476
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,120
it seems obvious that

477
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,720
this is where we're headed.

478
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,480
Is it more that we're going to see

479
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,600
greater productivity using these tools?

480
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,240
Are we going to see more happiness levels

481
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,680
or more satisfaction?

482
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,080
Because I feel pretty productive

483
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,880
right now, I have to say.

484
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,440
I have about a dozen Slack channels

485
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,640
from 10 different segments and workspaces,

486
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,440
and I feel pretty productive

487
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,960
and I'm wondering whether there is,

488
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,920
now the aim is to increase my productivity

489
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,040
or increase my happiness level?

490
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,440
Yeah. I think they both go hand in hand,

491
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,040
by the way.

492
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,280
I think that people could be

493
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,600
both productive and happy.

494
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
I think a lot of times

495
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,720
they actually complement each other.

496
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,240
So, if I'm able to be more productive,

497
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,440
I'm able to be get more satisfaction

498
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,400
out of my job.

499
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,880
So, I wouldn't think of happiness as like

500
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,840
just socializing at work or happiness as,

501
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,520
there is happiness

502
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,840
from doing the work itself.

503
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,040
I think, as far as where we're going,

504
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,920
let me first take a quick second,

505
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,000
I can't ever imagine going back to email.

506
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,640
I mean, I can't ever imagine

507
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,000
in fact, I would use this

508
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,680
as definitely a show stopper

509
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,960
in any future company I go to.

510
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,960
I couldn't imagine coming in the morning

511
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,480
and opening up an inbox,

512
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,760
and sorting through 100 or 200 emails

513
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,240
like I used to.

514
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,800
It just seems so counterproductive

515
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,520
to have my information

516
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,040
sorted by someone else based on

517
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,720
what subject they wrote

518
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,000
and when they sent the message.

519
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,720
With Slack in-channels,

520
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,080
I dictate where I work

521
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
and what's important to me.

522
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,440
I'm subscribing to the channels

523
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,760
that are most important to the projects

524
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,280
that are most important.

525
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,680
And I'm in control of my day.

526
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,120
It's just, it's so backwards for me

527
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,840
to think about email right now.

528
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,440
As far as where we're going in the future,

529
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,360
I think that there's no question.

530
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,000
You can see this with what slack,

531
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,280
you can see teams, of course,

532
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,800
the Capito's, but whatever.

533
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,560
You can see

534
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,880
the channel based communication,

535
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,280
this type of subscribing to the project

536
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,080
and the topics that I care about,

537
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,720
is the way to the future.

538
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,240
By the way, email is not different

539
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,840
as far as the information that it carry.

540
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,600
E-mail also had topics.

541
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,520
Everything that you did in email

542
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,160
was a topic.

543
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,320
You were hiring someone.

544
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,560
You were working on a project.

545
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,200
You were working on a campaign.

546
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,400
You had a channel

547
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,320
Exactly.

548
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,000
It just was disorganized.

549
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,080
It was just organized chronologically

550
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,440
based on when people sent you messages.

551
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,800
It just isn't organized well.

552
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,640
So, Slack is not like

553
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,880
this is new type of work.

554
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,560
It's just now organizing your work

555
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,840
based on topics.

556
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,760
And one of the really inspiring things

557
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,000
that I've experienced recently

558
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,120
is using superhuman as a client,

559
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,320
because they managed to reduce

560
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,680
the formality of the email.

561
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,120
Up until now, I felt an email,

562
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,600
I felt this great responsibility,

563
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,840
like it's so formal,

564
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,240
Dear Sir, and not simply as Michael.

565
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,320
Now with superhuman,

566
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,320
the way that they did at the chat based,

567
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
same thing with Slack.

568
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,640
When my manager here at Hippo Slack's me,

569
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,320
I  feel the informality.

570
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,920
It feels like an ongoing conversation

571
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,960
with the same content

572
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,320
that I would otherwise get in an email.

573
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,600
It makes me respond faster.

574
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,960
It makes me more confident.

575
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,520
All of a sudden I use emojis

576
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,320
in my messages.

577
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,640
I love using emojis.

578
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,160
It sounds like a joke,

579
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,040
but it's a serious thing.

580
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,960
It makes everything more fun.

581
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,640
Yeah. Yeah. I agree.

582
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,680
And more productive.

583
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,320
We use emojis, by the way,

584
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,240
for productivity.

585
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,800
So, when someone wants my attention

586
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,160
in a channel, they put a file

587
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
or something like that.

588
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,200
I will use the eyes emoji

589
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,880
to say that I'm looking at it.

590
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,840
And that spells in like calm down,

591
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm looking at it.

592
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,520
I didn't miss your message.

593
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,960
And then when I'm done,

594
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,040
I put a green checkbox emoji

595
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,200
saying it's done.

596
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,880
I finished my assignment, whatever it is.

597
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,800
And that way they know,

598
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,160
okay, this is done.

599
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,240
I'm starting to employ that with the team

600
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
that I'm on right here.

601
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,680
Yeah.

602
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,840
This was so, thank you for your time.

603
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,920
Thank you for the generosity.

604
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,400
This is so good.

605
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,440
I know how busy you are.

606
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,240
Before we leave, I need three words

607
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
that you would use to describe yourself.

608
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,400
Okay. Three words.

609
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,800
So, there's one word that,

610
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,560
However you want to do this.

611
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,320
There's one word that actually means

612
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,520
like all three together,

613
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,720
which is Kibbutznik.

614
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,760
I mean, I grew up in Ein Hod

615
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,560
and moved to Minnesota at age 10.

616
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,400
But the hard working,

617
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,080
collaborative and humble

618
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,560
are things that I aspire to be in my job.

619
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,160
And I learned those all

620
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,640
before the age of 10.

621
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,160
Wow.

622
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,120
Well, kibbutznik said at all.

623
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,160
You gave me the three words

624
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,000
anyways afterwards.

625
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,560
I love it.

626
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,520
Ilan, toda raba.

627
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,440
Thank you very very much.

628
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,440
We didn't even mention

629
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,040
the whole about J-Ventures

630
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,760
and working together.

631
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,360
And I think it's been such a pleasure

632
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,000
doing some due diligence with you.

633
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,320
And I've been learning a lot from you

634
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,040
and everybody else.

635
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,160
But thank you for your time,

636
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,480
for this, and for the fun.

637
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,480
And I look forward

638
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,680
to maintaining this relationship.

639
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,280
Thank you.

640
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,760
My pleasure. Thank you.

641
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:27,760
Bye bye.
