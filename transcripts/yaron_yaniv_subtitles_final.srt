1
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,700
Yaron Yaniv, thank you
so much for me joining

2
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,700
on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,700
Thank you for having me, Michael.

4
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,700
- Wonderful.
- It's great to be here.

5
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,700
Okay. So, I messed up again.
It’s happening a little bit more

6
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,700
often that I’d like it
That we begin talking,

7
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,700
and then I just forget to record
because I’m already fascinated

8
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,700
about what we’re talking about.
But I have the pleasure of speaking

9
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,300
now to somebody who was
one of the people responsible for

10
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,300
the architecture of Visa's
revenue streams.

11
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,000
Just to put that in perspective,
that’s a company that deals with

12
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,300
over a billion transactions a day.

13
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,700
A billion.

14
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,000
So quite a significant role,
but besides that

15
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,700
office of the CTO
of Silicon Valley Bank,

16
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,700
and LP at J-Ventures,
which I’m also a part of,

17
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,700
so I’ll repeat the question
that I had before. Yaron,

18
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,700
what does it take to lead the
enterprise architecture

19
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,700
for Visa's revenues streams?

20
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah, great question, Michael.
And you can probably guess being

21
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,700
a part of Visa,
pretty massive company

22
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:05,700
in more than 200 countries
all over the globe,

23
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,700
and dealing with that mass,
dealing with that volume

24
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,700
brings in huge, huge,
huge challenges.

25
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,700
So, some of them are related to
the ability to process that amount

26
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,700
of transaction in such a short
time span, right? Every day,

27
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,700
a billion plus transactions,
making sure that you process it.

28
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,700
[crosstalk]

29
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,700
Sorry?

30
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,700
In over 200 countries,
you mentioned which is -

31
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,700
In over 200 countries.
In over 200 countries, yeah.

32
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,700
All the protocols and

33
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,300
Mind-blowing.

34
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,700
Mind-blowing.

35
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,700
And what’s even more mind-blowing
is that you would need to apply

36
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,700
more than 10,000 rules to each
and every one of these 1 billion

37
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,000
transactions and make sure that
it’s taking into account in terms

38
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,700
of how you bill it
and how you service it,

39
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,700
and how you price it,
and how you aggregate it,

40
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,700
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
So, this by itself,

41
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,700
is two pretty massive challenges.
Add that to the fact that

42
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,700
everything needs to be
well-secured, compliant.

43
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,700
Everything has to be audited
to the cent and everything has to

44
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,700
really work and play as in
a concert with no

45
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,700
disruptions whatsoever.
That really adds

46
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,700
quite a lot to the mix.

47
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,700
I have to say that I recently
developed a software that is able

48
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,700
to make a thousand small
calculations in a few seconds

49
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,700
with microservices and all
that sexy stuff.

50
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,700
And I was so proud of myself.
And now, I just feel so small

51
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,700
when you’re talking
about 10,000 rules

52
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,700
over each transaction
as a part of a billion.

53
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,700
So, you have my appreciation.

54
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,700
Everything is relative in life.

55
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,900
[laughs]

56
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,700
That’s the first lesson
from the stock.

57
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,700
Fantastic. Okay, continue. Sorry.

58
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,700
No. No problem at all.
So, all these challenges

59
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,700
and why you need to continue
and develop the infrastructure

60
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,000
in your software stack
and the ability to innovate

61
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,700
and to be open to innovation.
Dealing, of course,

62
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,700
with very, very
some of the systems

63
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,700
that are super legacy,
modernizing that stack,

64
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:19,700
fostering the ability to open up
and be able to serve different

65
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,700
organizations,
internal and external.

66
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,700
That was quite a wild ride.

67
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,700
My Visa days
- Yeah, no

68
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,700
I’m sure.
So, give me a little bit of

69
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,700
the day-to-day of
Is it stressful, first?

70
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Is it stressful managing
such a critical piece

71
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
of the financial puzzle?

72
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,700
There’s a lot of
stress involved, yes.

73
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,700
Again, revenue systems,
you have to deal with money.

74
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,700
And money is really,
really critical.

75
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,700
So, we got into situations
when we were, at some occasions,

76
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,000
missing even a few
pennies here and there,

77
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,700
even a few dollars here and there.
Things did not match.

78
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,700
Things did not settle.
And because of Visa reputation

79
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,700
and the commitment
to be always 100% up and accurate,

80
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,300
there were some stressful
situations where we needed

81
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,700
to make sure that everything
is well-reconciled

82
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,700
and we were able to send
the settlement files

83
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,700
and payments over,
essentially charge,

84
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,700
the different clients
the right amount.

85
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,700
So, definitely some situations
there in addition to the ability

86
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,700
to process that volume
within a short time span.

87
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,000
How many people are
how many people were involved

88
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,700
with this whole engineering feat?

89
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,700
You know, there were not huge
amounts of engineers involved.

90
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,700
I don’t want it to sound like
we had 10,000 people

91
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,700
on the ground essentially working
to get this machinery going on.

92
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,700
It was around 100 to 150

93
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,700
Wow. That’s -

94
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,700
across the board.

95
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,700
Incredibly impressive.
And I have to ask because I’m

96
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,000
What am I staring at?
Where are you

97
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,700
right now in the world?

98
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,700
So, this is actually
Tongariro Pass

99
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,700
which is northern part
northern island off New Zealand.

100
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,000
And I actually have a habit
of keeping my virtual background

101
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,700
in Zoom rotating across
all the different hikes

102
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,700
I did across my 40-plus years
on planet earth.

103
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Incredible.
What was your favorite hike?

104
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,700
That’s one of the top 5 for sure.

105
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,700
[laughs]

106
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,700
It’s like asking somebody,
"Who’s your favorite child?"

107
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,700
I like them all.
They’re just different

108
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,700
Is the lake actually green
when you’re there?

109
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
No, it’s just a
It’s kind of a

110
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,700
looks like it’s green,
but it’s not.

111
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,700
It’s actually
Okay, great.

112
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Very talented photographer.

113
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,300
Definitely, definitely.
So Yaron, talk to me

114
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,700
now, a little about
Silicon Valley Bank.

115
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,700
What is that and what is your role
over there as part

116
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,700
of the office of the CTO?

117
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,700
Sure. Going from Visa
to Silicon Valley Bank,

118
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,700
I needed to do some shifting.
And Silicon Valley Bank

119
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,700
is a commercial bank
which the population

120
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,700
that it serves is
innovation economy.

121
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,300
In fact, 65% of all
the innovation economy

122
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,300
money in the US
is being processed

123
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,300
through Silicon Valley Bank.
And we have representation

124
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,300
over all the main innovation hubs
So, we have a branch

125
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,700
in Israel and in
big one in the UK,

126
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,700
and in Canada, and Germany.
Wherever there is

127
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,000
innovation spurring,
you’re going to find

128
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,700
Silicon Valley Bank there.

129
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,700
What does that mean,
a bank that is

130
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,700
that it’s main customer base
is innovation?

131
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,700
What does that mean?
- So, we have

132
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,700
We have a set of unique
products that is really tailored

133
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,300
and geared towards start-ups.
Private equity firms.

134
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,700
And when we're saying start-ups,
it’s everywhere from series A,

135
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,700
series B, C, all the way up
to established companies

136
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,700
that are already in the NASDAQ
and are already public companies.

137
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,700
So, we do have products that are
tailored towards that cohort.

138
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,300
We're specialized in
products that are tailored

139
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,700
toward that cohort.
And that’s really

140
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,700
the secret sauce ...

141
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,700
Right. And then what
so how does that differ

142
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,700
in the mindset when you’re
creating, when you’re working

143
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,000
at an organization
that is tailored to innovation

144
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,700
with all the dynamics
that it brings with it, right?

145
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,700
Because I’m
'cause I guess different

146
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,000
from the average citizen
or the average company

147
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
that has a bank account.
Start-ups go up.

148
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,700
They go down.
They raise 10 million.

149
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,700
They lose 12 million.
So, how does that mindset shift?

150
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,700
Exactly. Exactly right.
You just said it.

151
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,700
So, you’re talking about
a cohort of clients that is

152
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,700
very different because
an early-stage founder,

153
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,700
which has a team of 10,
has very different needs

154
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:12,700
from a ... client
that is a well-established company

155
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,700
with 500 employees
that runs on $100 million cycle.

156
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,700
So, they have different needs,
but they are all entrepreneurs.

157
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:27,700
They all have a need to get banking
financial products from us.

158
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,700
So, that requires us to essentially
have different facets of products

159
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,700
and different lines of products
that can cater towards

160
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,700
these different sectors.
In addition, we’re working

161
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,700
with entrepreneurs.
We all know what entrepreneurs

162
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,700
are after, right?
They need things that work fast.

163
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,700
They need things that work slick.
They need things that are

164
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,700
tailored to their needs.
And they want to do that

165
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,700
from their mobile device.

166
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,700
- Right.
- So

167
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,700
having a stack, having products
that are tailored towards what

168
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,700
entrepreneurs are after
and their set of mind

169
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,700
and of course,
they want things that change.

170
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,700
I mean, today, it’s this.
Tomorrow, it’s that.

171
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,700
They don’t want to wait
for 12 months for somebody

172
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,700
to come in and come up
with a product that’s tailored

173
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,700
for an ever-changing market.

174
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Right. So, you’re very
strategically positioned within

175
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,700
this financial tech industry.
What really excites you about it?

176
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,700
Why choose to go into banks?
With your tech skillsets,

177
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,700
I mean you’re wanted in every
tech company in the world.

178
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,700
So, why specifically
banking and finance?

179
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,700
So, I think because of that
very close interface

180
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
with entrepreneurs.

181
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Hmm.

182
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,700
So, Silicon Valley Bank sees
itself not only as a bank.

183
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,700
We’re not that
an ATM, you go and

184
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,700
get money from,
and that’s it.

185
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
We’re actually
building relationships.

186
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,000
So, I have the opportunity
as an architect to speak to many,

187
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,700
many, many companies

188
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,700
Really?

189
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,700
and explain to them
and work with them,

190
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,700
and kind of give them an insight
on what does it take to work with

191
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:12,700
regulated financial institutes.
That is very precious information

192
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,700
and something that
that companies really, really value.

193
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,700
So, we do that.
We have the ability to connect

194
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,700
between different clients of ours
because we know that client A

195
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,700
might be well-integrated
with client B.

196
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,000
And sometimes, we even adopt
technologies that are

197
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,700
coming in from our clients,
which we always look at favorably.

198
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,000
- Incredible.
- So you

199
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,300
get that ability to really
work within that

200
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,700
innovation economy,
within the innovation ecosystem.

201
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
That was something that was
really appealing to me.

202
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,000
And that’s something I
For example, Visa was

203
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,700
very different in that sense.

204
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,700
Right. And I’m guessing
it’s also different number of

205
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,300
employees around the world
and the magnitude

206
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,700
must be different, right?
Because Visa is just

207
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,700
it’s crazy.

208
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,300
A juggernaut. Exactly.
So, Silicon Valley Bank

209
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,000
is a medium-sized bank.
Fairly small, smaller presence

210
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,700
in California and in other
areas in the world.

211
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,700
But I think the culture also,
because of the need

212
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,700
and the ability to speak with
and engage with our entrepreneurs,

213
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,700
the culture within
the bank is very open,

214
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,700
very honest, very authentic.

215
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,700
- Right.
- These are things

216
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,700
that I really do appreciate.

217
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,700
But I have to really
get to the bottom of this

218
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,700
because you’re saying
that you’re a technology architect

219
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,000
within Silicon Valley Bank.
So, it’s an engineering

220
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,700
leadership role, correct?

221
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,000
So, the interesting thing with
what I’m doing is

222
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,700
I’m sitting right in the junction
between engineering,

223
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,700
business, and product.
And that’s my sweet spot.

224
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,000
Right. So, talk
so that sweet spot,

225
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I’d love to just learn
a little bit more about

226
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,300
what it means to talk
to the entrepreneurs

227
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,700
and to your customers
while having all

228
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,700
of these different hats on.

229
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,300
Absolutely.
And I think what it does

230
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,700
and what it requires you to do is
to really think

231
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,700
like a product manager.
Think like an engineer.

232
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,700
Think like a businessperson
when you are trying to roll

233
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,000
out technology changes
and when you speak

234
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,700
with entrepreneurs.
So, you bring in that multiple

235
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,700
angles to the conversation.
So, if you think

236
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,700
like a product manager
What features, what makes

237
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:28,700
more sense to invest in?
What will kind of turn the needle

238
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,300
or move the needle.
And when you think

239
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,700
like an engineer it's
how do you build your stack

240
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,700
in an open way with your APIs
that you want to expose

241
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,000
so partners like
Silicon Valley Bank

242
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
can work with you easily?
Where is your encryption of

243
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,700
the data that you’re going to
save your sensitive data?

244
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,700
Those types of specific areas
that you can bring to the table.

245
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,000
So, you bring in a meal
that’s made out of a few courses,

246
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,700
essentially, not just the
one-dimensional angle.

247
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,300
Yeah no, definitely.
So, you’re not just drawn

248
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,700
to the entrepreneurs
at Silicon Valley Bank, but

249
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,700
also as a part
of venture capital,

250
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,700
and you’re an LP
at the J-Ventures Fund.

251
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,700
So, where does that
interest come from?

252
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,300
And how do you balance
that interest with being inside

253
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,700
of a big corporate?

254
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,000
Great question.
So, the fact that I’ve been working

255
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,700
with entrepreneurs in the last
four years certainly helped me

256
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,700
kind of getting close
to that ecosystem.

257
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,700
Right.

258
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:35,000
I think that it really triggered
my interest into the VC community

259
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,700
and into the capital community,
capital funding community.

260
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,700
I also feel very strong
around the mission

261
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,700
that J-Ventures
has with keeping that

262
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:52,700
the gap or closing the gap between
Israelis and American Jews.

263
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,300
Of course.

264
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,700
We definitely see
opportunities there

265
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,700
and I’m excited about that mission.
So, a combination

266
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,700
of those two together
that’s really what was driving me

267
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,700
over towards J-Ventures.
Very happy so far.

268
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,700
A hundred percent.
No, no. Me, too.

269
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,000
But do you have that sort of like
irkness or those like goosebumps

270
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,300
when you see the entrepreneurs
and do you have that sense of,

271
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,700
“Well, maybe one day,
I want to do

272
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
go on an adventure
like that as well"?

273
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,700
Or are you happy
with the intersection of business

274
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,300
and executive technology
within a large corporation

275
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,700
while investing?

276
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,700
Can’t lie Michael.
I always have something

277
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,700
at the back of my mind that says,
“How about that idea?

278
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,000
How about this idea?”
So, I do have a few things

279
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
in the back of my mind
but the opportunity

280
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,700
just didn’t present itself yet.
And it’s all about timing

281
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,700
and the right time,
and the right

282
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,700
the right location.
So, my brother by the way,

283
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,700
is an entrepreneur.
So, he’s kind of

284
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,700
adding a lot of fire or a lot of
oil into that fire as well.

285
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,700
At all the Shabbat dinners I'm sure.

286
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,700
Exactly. So, it’s somewhere there.
Hasn’t been materialized yet,

287
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,700
but life is short, you know?

288
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,700
Let’s see what
we do in the future.

289
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,700
A hundred percent.
A hundred percent.

290
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,700
No, that’s really fantastic.
And I’d love to sort of shift

291
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,700
and understand a little
bit better about this

292
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,700
about fintech and about the
financial world as it is.

293
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,700
I know nothing about it
except for the fact that I know

294
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,700
how to swipe my credit card
and hopefully check pretty often

295
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,700
to make sure that my
balance is above zero.

296
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,000
I don’t know much.
Give me a little bit of your

297
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,700
insight into what’s happening
in 2020 with finance

298
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,700
and how consumers
are interacting with their banks.

299
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,700
And where are we headed from here?

300
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,700
Sure. And digital is
definitely the big thing.

301
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:54,000
Digital, meaning that you
don’t want to call your bank.

302
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,700
You don’t want to send
your bank an email.

303
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,000
You want to be able
to interact with your bank

304
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,700
through digital means,
through digital applications.

305
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,700
If you own a company,
if you own a start-up

306
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,700
or a private equity company,
you want to have APIs,

307
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,700
which are ways to interact
with your bank without needing

308
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,700
to even use a mobile app.
You just hook in your systems

309
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,700
through APIs and you’ve got
everything done automatically

310
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,700
for some of your needs.
So, digital and automation

311
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,700
are really big right now
in the ecosystem.

312
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,300
In the commercial ecosystem,
even more, right?

313
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,700
So, if you do have a business,
if you need to do payment,

314
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,000
if you want to be able
to shift money in between accounts,

315
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,700
if you want to be able to
pay different bills,

316
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,700
you want all that
to be very automated,

317
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
very streamlined,
very simple for you.

318
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,700
You also want to have
different payments

319
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,000
and different ways to pay.
And depending on

320
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
how you want to pay
sometimes you’re willing

321
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,700
to pay more to get
things done quicker.

322
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,700
Sometimes, you have the ability
to wait with some of your payments.

323
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,700
So, you want to have the ability
to choose between

324
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,700
different types of payments.
You don’t want just

325
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,700
to do wires 100% of the time.

326
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,700
Yeah.

327
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,700
Cards is another great example.
Cards are blowing up.

328
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,700
I mean the cards industry
is just, and Visa of course,

329
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,700
is a main beneficiary out of this.
But the cards industry

330
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,700
and the products on cards
are right exploding.

331
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,000
So loyalty and the ability to do
so many things with

332
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,700
virtual cards.
Pay your vendors,

333
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,700
pay your employees
with virtual cards.

334
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,000
That’s been a very
hot topic as well.

335
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,700
So, it really is a lot around
digital, around payments,

336
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,700
around automation.
That’s what I would say

337
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,700
are three main trends
of what we see around.

338
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,700
And how does trust
play into all of this,

339
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,700
especially as things are
transitioning to paperless,

340
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,700
or they have transitioned,
but in some parts of the world

341
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,700
I was recently visiting Mexico
with a friend and we were sitting

342
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,700
with one of the top start-ups
there who are now helping

343
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,700
digitalize the banking
system in Mexico.

344
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,700
And it turns out that most people
there don't have credit cards yet

345
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,700
and don’t have digital banking yet.
So, how do you

346
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,700
how much does trust play into
this whole transition

347
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,700
that the world is going through?

348
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,700
I think, so we’re a
commercial bank

349
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,700
so we don’t work
with individuals.

350
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,700
We work with -
- Right.

351
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,700
commercial entities.
But I can look at trust

352
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,700
from maybe a different
angle for you.

353
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,700
When we talk about identity

354
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
Yes.

355
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,700
and the ability
So, think about it, right

356
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,700
We’re in a world
where fake reality

357
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:44,000
is very much becoming
almost the real reality in many,

358
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,700
many different occasions.
And you hear about use cases

359
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,000
and occasions where folks
were kind of pretending

360
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
to be person X
and calling person Y,

361
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and telling him to just wire
a million dollars to that specific address

362
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,700
and they were sure it was the CEO,
et cetera, et cetera.

363
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:14,700
So, being able to transact
financially in a safe way is huge.

364
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
Right.

365
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,000
And for that,
there are different technologies.

366
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Some of them are coming in
in a pretty big way,

367
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,700
such as voice recognition,
such as biometrics behavior

368
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,700
or behavioral biometrics,
and other ways

369
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,000
that we are also thinking of
of how to do that

370
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,700
transactional journey,
how to do that identification,

371
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,000
multi-factor authentication.

372
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,700
Yeah.

373
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,700
All of that good stuff
to make sure that you are you

374
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,700
when you try to transact
with us, is critical.

375
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,700
And the most important thing
is how you do that

376
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,700
without putting a huge
burden on the user that

377
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,700
all he want is just to move
$100 between his accounts.

378
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,700
Exactly. Exactly.
Yaron, that’s just fascinating.

379
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,000
We do have to end soon,
but I’d love to ask you

380
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,300
the last question, which is
three words that you would

381
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,700
use to describe yourself.

382
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,700
Wow, three words. All right.
So let me think.

383
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,700
We said two to four, so

384
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,700
Three is a good median.
Happy median.

385
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,700
So, how about we go with humble?

386
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,700
Yes.

387
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,700
Very important to me,

388
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,000
very important for me
to be in a place

389
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,700
where people are humble.

390
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:30,700
Curious, which really goes
hand in hand with humble

391
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,700
being humble and really wanting
to learn and understand more.

392
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,700
And I think I'm very focused.
So, I got this maniacal focus

393
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,700
that I actually jump on things
and I make sure that things

394
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:49,700
are done and very, very
important not to get distracted.

395
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,700
So, that would be
my three key words.

396
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,000
Yaron, I think it’s incredible
and I can’t even imagine

397
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,700
what it’s like to even be
a part of a team that

398
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,300
let alone lead it,
that manages this

399
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,000
infrastructure of
Oh my god.

400
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,300
Today, it’s a billion
transactions a day.

401
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,700
I’m gonna have to go back
to my drawing board

402
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,700
of a thousand calculations.

403
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,700
Yeah you scale that baby up.
You scale it up.

404
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,700
I love it, Yaron. Toda raba.
Thank you very much.

405
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,700
- Great. Thanks.
- And I’ll see you around J-Ventures.

406
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,700
Thank you for having me.

407
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,000
- Take care.
- Have a good one.

408
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
- Bye-bye.
