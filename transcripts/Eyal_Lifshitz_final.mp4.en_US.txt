1 The last piece that clicked was, okay, there's something big here, I love this industry. There's an ability to really make a difference for small businesses. And then it was like, you know what, this needs to be you doing it. It can't be somebody else executing on your vision. You need to do it. Eyal Liftshitz, thank you for joining me all the way from California. How are you? I'm great. Thanks for having me, Michael. Of course. I'm both jealous and not jealous of you. I can't wait to come back and live in Silicon Valley. It's such a wonderful place. But, you know, it's an interesting time where we are now. So, I'll hopefully we'll get to meet in person in a few months. But for now, I'll get to hear all about your journey all the way from Israel and Chicago Booth to Greylock, McKinsey and now, BlueVine. So, Eyal, first walk me back all the way to your pizza delivery days. What is that all about? I think, well, I started by, my first job was delivering pizzas, okay. And I think this is highlighting the fact that, you know, I didn't start my career in tech. And even furthermore, you know, kind of a funny or an anecdote here, I did not own a computer before I was around 22. Really. So, yes, I was a carefree teenager. I served, I didn't really care about technology. In the military, I served in infantry. I did not go to 8200 or 8100. I basically, decided to go and pursue a technology career back in, it was 2000 when I started my degree in electrical engineering. And it was due to a choice that I really didn't know what I wanted to do in life at the time. And high tech seemed like a good opportunity. You know, tech was booming in the year 2000. I didn't have a lot of sense of what that means. But you know what? People are making good money in technology, why don't I go into high tech. And the pizza delivery story connect to that, I think a little bit, even comically. I used to deliver pizzas, I lived in Ramat Aviv at the time, and I delivered pizzas in a pizzeria in Ramat Aviv. And I used to deliver a lot to like the tech companies in Atidim and other places. And I asked him, like, "What are you guys doing?" They were like, "Well, we're engineers." So, I was like, okay, I need to go and do this job. This is a good job, you know, getting the pizza delivered to you versus delivery. So, that was the start of my you know, my pizza delivery days is kind of like grounded me into tech. I love it. Was it Pizza Fino by any chance? It was Pizza Fino. It is my all time favorite pizza. I'm from Ramat Aviv as well, and I used to eat there almost on a daily basis. So, we already have a huge thing in common. And I'm hugely appreciative even more than what you do at BlueVine, I think what you did with Pizza Fino tops that much more so. So, thank you for that. But you're actually, your entrepreneurial experience goes beyond just the pizzas and then your understanding to transition to a different industry. Your family, you say you're a third generation entrepreneur. Right? So, talk to me a little bit about that and how that runs in the family. It's an interesting story here. And I don't know if it runs in the family. And I'll explain further on that. My dad was a small business owner. He had a physical therapy clinic in the Upper East Side of New York for 30 years. His dad owned a kind of lighting electricity lighting store in Dizingof for 40 years. So, both of them were small business owners. And you know, the reason why small business owners start their business is many of them don't want a boss. And they want to be able to run, you know, their own kind of thing and do their own, you know, run their own show. And so, I view small business owners as entrepreneurs by their own right. They start their company, or their business or their whatever. And they share many of the same things that we do in startup land when we start a company. There's many of the same pain points, you need to figure out your business plan, your hiring, how to generate revenue. Of course, it's a different outcome. And they're not looking to build a billion dollar companies. But there's a lot of the same stuff, especially when they start out. Right. You know, in terms of running in the family, I don't know if it runs in the family. I didn't know that I wanted to be an entrepreneur up until I started BlueVine. If you look at my career, you know, it's a pretty safe journey. I kind of stuck to larger companies, pretty strong brand names. I didn't really take any risk before I started BlueVine. There are some people that they graduate from college and they know that their destiny is to start a company. They know they want to be an entrepreneur. I did not have that. Interesting. I wasn't that. I very much followed a safe path. And the reason I started BlueVine was less so about the personal interest or the draw to actually become a founder, but rather the opportunity and the calling. You know, even further adding to that in the beginning, the mindset working in venture capital and seeing the opportunity to start BlueVine I was like, why don't we find a CEO to do this. When do we found somebody else to do this. I wasn't thinking that this would be me. But I got so consumed with the idea and the opportunity that at some point, you know, this is mine, I need to really go do this. So, walk me through that thinking process. Because you're a principal at Greylock, one of the best investment groups in the world based in your, in the cohort based in Israel. You're thinking about this industry. You're thinking about small business owners. Obviously, this has a connection to you coming from a family of small business owners and you're understanding that there is a gap in the market, an opportunity that at the end you decide to go and fulfill it yourself with BlueVine. What are those weeks, days, months like? What does that process look like for a safe journeyed you know, technology guy and somebody who is working in tech, working in fantastic beginnings, McKinsey, Greylock. And you're saying, you know what, I'm ready to go start my own journey. What is that thinking process like for you? It was an evolution. So first, when you work in venture, you get exposed to entrepreneurship in general. You worked with a lot of founders. You assess investments. And, you know, entrepreneurship is somewhat infectious. You see the excitement of people starting something from nothing. You kind of follow their journey from the outside in. And, you know, there's a lot of excitement that rubs off. So first, being in venture did move me closer in that direction. The story of BlueVine at the beginning was more of an analytical exercise. I had an opportunity to look and see a lot of companies in the fintech space through Greylock Israel. And there were heavy investors in fintech at the time. And I realized that there's an opportunity, there's a white space, specifically at the time when we started the company and factoring. And I was a big fan of what was happening in online financing, and I realized there were still areas of opportunities. And so, when I learned about factoring at the time, it clicked that there is an ability to take a page from what was being done in other sort of products and apply it here. And the market sizes is quite large. And so that from an analytical from the outside in, it really connected. And then there was a personal passion always to evaluate and see opportunities within small businesses. And this does relate to my personal background. I did grow up around my father's business. I heard about him talking about growing up with his father's business, around his father's business. It's something that was always around me. I had a connection to this segment. And so those two things came together in terms of, wow, there is really something here. And the last piece that clicked was, okay, there's something big here. I love this industry. There's an ability to really make a difference for small businesses. And then it was like, you know what, this needs to be you doing it. It can't be somebody else executing on your vision. You need to do it. And, you know, while I was 35 at the time, I did not want to be an entrepreneur until that point in my life. At that point, sort of like the regret minimization framework kicked in. It was like, if I don't do this, I'm going to regret it 20 years in the future. So, I jumped in. So, do you categorize yourself as a full time entrepreneur? I categorize myself as a full time founder. Yes, a full time entrepreneur. You know, I think when you start a company, the definition of entrepreneur versus CEO, they get kind of mixed over the life of a company. Right. I think I'm becoming more and more of a CEO as time goes by and the company becomes larger. Of course, I'm a founder CEO. So, that is something that is always part of my sort of outlook. But as time goes by, as you take more of the role of the CEO and your role in the company rather than just being the founder. Sure. Can you share a little bit more about about the industry and the market of small businesses? What's happening today, especially in the United States that you're observing? How do you even get to that that big pain point that you've observed? And what is the trend look like as we are now in 2021, I guess? So, I will say that the vision of the company evolved significantly from when we started. We started with a very narrow product set, answering, factoring and making that an online product then evolved to providing a full range of printed products. And today, we really involved in delivering end to end banking. And so, it wasn't, there wasn't any pivot along the way. This was a continued expansion of the business model and strategy. So, you're considering it as an evolvement, as an evolvement of that narrow idea that you've understood, okay, there's actually a bigger gap than what we thought. Yes. Yes. You know, there was an entry point here, but over time, realizing that the real opportunity is to essentially fix small business banking as a whole and factoring is part of credit and credit is part of banking. And banking as a whole, is broken for small businesses. And that is the true opportunity that we're looking to solve, which includes everything that belongs under making checking accounts, credit, payments, everything else. This has been sort of an evolution that happened through understanding our customers and their pain points. Now, when you are referring to small businesses, broadly, what has been happening in the last two decades, essentially, they've been outsourcing their financial services from their bank no longer that they do most of their or interact with their bank for most of their financial services need. They still hold their checking account with their bank. But payment processing they get from Square, from PayPal, from Stripe. Payments, they get from bill.com. Credit, they get historically from third party lenders like us and others. It's been a world where things that you would expect to get from your bank and corporations definitely get from their bank. Small businesses end up needing to rely on many third party providers, not their bank. And that is not an ideal market. That's not an ideal outcome. The ideal outcome is they can actually have a banking partner that can answer all of their needs under one place and everything works together seamlessly. And that is what we're doing. Providing them access to everything they need under one roof and making it very easy to transact digitally. That's another big point. And that really connects to the pandemic. It's interesting. Both consumers, they don't go to the branch anymore. When's the last time do you went to the branch? I sometimes ask that question and people tell you, I actually went last week. Eyal, I don't even know that there are branches that are still existing. You're telling me a new news now. I can't believe that they're still operating in person. They are. And you know, when you look at the small business segment, interestingly, while consumers over time have stopped going to the branches, definitely the younger generations, small businesses, small business owners on average still go, on average, at least once a week to the branch. Why? Because they don't have everything at their disposal to be able to transact digitally. You know, adding to that the pandemic, that doesn't work anymore. So, certainly there's a lot of like tailwinds right now for providers like us to be able to provide a small business the ability to transact digitally without needing to go to the branch. Certainly right now is not a time where small business value going to the branch. And even before it was a hassle and the time stuck. Now, it's just impossible and there's a health concern. So, that certainly is giving us an increased push for what we're doing. In addition, during this time when small businesses have been struggling and facing a lot of challenges given the economic environment, the banking industry has not necessarily all stepped up to serving them, you know, in a very robust way. And so, the fact that we are 100% focused on this segment and are able to deliver really great banking experience, I think today even speaks even more loan. And I think that one of the most fascinating things that I love about what you're doing is that it's not just that you're coming in and you're educating the market, but you have a series of other players that are coming in, they're educating the market on the different angles. Right. So, obviously, the digital transactions and the whole way that we're dealing with digital assets today are completely different than 10, 15 years ago. And having that end to end banking solutions, I'm looking at the different banks here in Israel and in the United States, the adaptation is so slow. They're still focused on the different consuming habits. And I think that what you're doing here has impeccable timing. And obviously, I can't imagine in pandemic of 2020, the different you know, the way that you seeing your vision coming together and how the world has accelerated towards this new world that you're providing a solution to. But Eyal, I also want to pick your brain as the founder and CEO. So, you're saying that you're transitioning solely from being the founder and the entrepreneur towards now being the CEO? You're the CEO of a company that raised hundreds of millions of dollars, right? It's a big responsibility. Lots of employees. Now, you really are a big CEO of considerably big company. What are some of the thoughts shifts that you've had to do as a leader intrinsically, as you're transitioning to your role? Because your role today, I am imagining is very, very different from your role four or five years ago. Right? And it's been a very quick shift. Yeah. I mean, quick is a relative term, right? It's been seven years since we started the company. And it feels like, it's like startup years are like gotten years, you know. On one hand, it feels it was just only yesterday that we started the company. But when I'm reflecting back and everything that we went through over over seven years, it's a lot. It feels like a lifetime. Yes, the transition is significant from starting out to over time, it doesn't happen in one day. In the beginning, a founder, you do everything that you need to do. You're basically the, you know, the cook, the you know, the office manager, the recruiter, the programmer. You do whatever you need to do in the beginning, you're all up the sleeves and you work towards getting stuff done. And, you know, in the beginning, there's a lot of focus on you doing. And of course, you hire employees, but you are involved in whatever needs to be done. And there's a lot of things to be done and shortage of resources. And you make all of the decisions in the beginning, a lot of the decisions flow through you. Over time, it becomes less of doing, but more of making sure that you have the right people in place and you're empowering them and you're creating the right organizational structures to be able to scale. So, it's interesting, you know. The type of work that you do as the founder really changes every two years based on the size of the company and based on kind of the general scale of the business. So, you know, it's not one day, but it does, every two-year, you kind of need to think about what do I need to be doing, what do I not need to be doing. The things that you always own as a CEO is the vision. You always are responsible for selling the company. In selling I mean, to investors, to employees, to media. You're always on a sales mode. You always drive culture. That happens from the early days, even when the company is larger, that is a responsibility of the CEO. And, you know, and again, vision. Like vision and strategy is sort of like connected. And there are different types of CEOs. There are sort of like more product oriented CEOs and there's more sales oriented CEOs. I personally, I put myself more in the first category. And so, I'm very passionate about product. And I do get involved in product. Even my level of involvement with product has changed considerably over time. In the beginning, I was literally writing specs myself and working with the engineers over time. As we grew, we have product management. Now we have a phenomenal chief product officer. Now, it's more about just providing feedback around the roadmap, making sure that the vision is instilled with the, you know, the plan that we're putting together. And then obviously, I have opinions around certain product and specifically around product experience that I make sure to voice them. But I am no longer in the driver's seat. I'm more of a coach of a reactive sort of position. When you're building a company. The main thing you want to do is to make sure that you have really great people that are motivated and are pushing forward. Because as you scale, you can't be everywhere. So, it becomes from you doing everything to make sure that you have phenomenal people that are able to execute on your vision. So, it sounds to me like your journey is full of firsts. Right? Every two years, your role is changing. But that means that really every two years you are reinventing your role as the CEO. You have to adapt to the new environment every time you get a chance to debrief over what you've learned and sort of the skills you've mastered, you all of a sudden have to reinvent and master these new skills. So, how do you keep yourself in check? Because it sounds to me like a lot of the things that you have to deal with every now and then are brand new. And maybe sometimes there are things that you don't have the right skill sets to do. How do you, as the CEO, the person that everybody is looking towards, how do you keep yourself balanced and making sure that you're actually doing the right thing? I think the way to do that is learn from everybody around you, learn from your investors and your board. Learn from your executive team. It's interesting. As the founder or CEO of a company, you get to be the only executive on the team without experience and learning. Right. It's an interesting phenomenon like, if we're talking scales, you end up having very senior executives around you, which you are much less experienced than them. And that's okay because you bring something different to the table. But you need to be open and vulnerable and you need to be able to be in a position when you're learning from people around you and you're accepting feedback. And so some of the changes and an evolution for me, again, this is my first time as a CEO, I wasn't a CEO before, so it is learning through feedback. It is this being in a position where you have your ears open and you're hearing what people are saying and sometimes it's painful feedback. It's people telling you you shouldn't be doing this, you should be doing this. And, you know, you could be in a position and be defensive and clutch on to your previous behaviors, but then you would not grow. So, I think part of my ability to grow as a CEO in this company is just, you know, being open to feedback, reflecting on it and thinking about how I can get better every day. And that is something that I do. Every week, I think to myself, what should I be doing and what shouldn't I be doing. I love that. Eyal, thank you so much for being so generous with your time. I know how busy you are. And you have so much on your plate, and I really appreciate you taking the time to provide your insights, expertise and your humble nature. Honestly, it really does inspire me to watch a CEO as a learner. And I hope to take a similar route to yours and continue to be a lifelong learner and keep checking who are the right people around me and what do I need to do to continue learning and adapting. Before we leave, I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. Three words. Honest. Hardworking. And funny. I try to take things lightly. I love that. Eyal, toda raba Thank you very, very much. And best of luck with BlueVine. And I hope to meet you in person after this whole thing spins out, this pandemic. Thank you. Same here. Take care.
