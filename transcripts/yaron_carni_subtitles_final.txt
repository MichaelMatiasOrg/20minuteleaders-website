Yaron Carni thank you so much for joining me on 20 minute leaders my pleasure thank you for having me you're calling from Israel, right? I am how is everything over there? things are starting to get back to some form of normalization starting this week but it's way too early to assess I myself am still at home yeah, you will You know, this is going to be broadcasted in just a few weeks so hopefully by then we'll keep on the optimism and and they're starting to open up or we fully opened up but we'll see I doubt it but let's see We'll see, we'll see OK so, Yaron, such a great pleasure thank you so much founder of Maverick Partners you're on the board of of some incredible organizations that we'll touch upon A contributor at Forbes I've been falling for a long time I'm a big fan, and I'd love to spend these 20 minutes to sort of pick your brain and have a discussion on what it's like to open up a venture capital firm in a pretty non-traditional way like you did while at the same time really being a core part of these organizations and companies so maybe, give me a quick rundown of what happened in your life that led to Maverick and then joining these awesome companies so OK, so that goes back to my schooling I would assume specifically yeah, I studied I grew up in the States for a bunch of years I'm Israeli born, grew up in the States and then moved back to Israel to finish high school, do the army and all that and then I started studying here in Israel at the IDC at the Zell program I was in the second Zell Program class wow I just did a talk with Liat Aaronson I don't know if she was the director back then she wasn't she wasn't born then when I, when I was a student and she's terrific, she's a force behind the program, for the last many, many years, over a decade, of course, anyhow so I study there and I was always an entrepreneur, from a very young age I can remember myself, really dabbling in every kind of different feel that you could imagine I was always attracted to setting up companies and setting up businesses and failing I failed a lack with a lot of different, different ideas and a bit after the my first degree, my bachelor degree, I flew back to New York and I worked there with my brother he had a promotional staffing agency like H.R. Platform at the Times for independent contractors that he had founded, called G.C. Marketing and I went back and helped him with the company and about a year later, we found a buyer who we sold the majority holdings to the company to and I decided to come home back home to Israel and I came back and I was looking for what to do and then I was, actually I started my master's degree in IP law and I decided that I am very attracted to the whole field of technologies and patents was that really your first interception with technology when you did your masters in IP is that when you really got into it I think during the Zell program, I was most exposed to it and it actually goes back the story connects and you're even connected to it, to this story indirectly, you yourself and then I, I decided, I teamed up with with a friend from New York who is a very successful businessperson who I met actually also in my studies and he had sold his company in the States and he said, you know what, let's start I keep hearing about Israeli innovation let's start an angel group together in which we will invest in very early stage Israeli companies so I was, it was basically, you know, everyone has that moment in their life, that completely changes their life that was my moment at the time wow And to this day, it's probably my moment and I remember that call and I said, all right, great and I started looking for startups to invest in and I was you know, I was looking for things for quite a long time and I couldn't find anything that I really liked and so I this I thought at the time that, you know, basically I'm screwed in a way where this is just too difficult to do and then out of nowhere, I was very, very lucky to have to have been to have re-met my classmate from the Zell program of ... he had set up a company with four other founders that was called Lab Pixie's. Lab Pixie's did widgets for I Google, I Google is the equivalent of say the App Store nowadays but this was in prehistoric times oh such a long time ago I remember it from my childhood exactly and that company I remember it launched and the very first first day it made five dollars and I thought wow this is an amazing company because there's so much potential and we, I ended up convincing my partner to invest and he thought it was you know, he didn't really connect to it as much and we put a million dollars in the company I put a hundred thousand dollars in the company, which was all I had and, you know, it was all the money I had saved up and you know it was a long journey I also became the the head of bisdev at the company so I was both an investor and relatively actively involved we also also invested in six other six companies in total and that company Lab Pixies ended up being the first Israeli company to be sold to Google wow the Google guy and he was based in the States at the time and we started talking that led to a relationship that was really amazing and then the deal was done very quickly and it was really a true pleasure to work with Google in this process and then at the time made me quite known in the market and I got a lot of deal flow off the site right as I mentioned earlier, we had invested in six companies yeah, well, two of them folded and four of them, we were able to sell wow that's considered a very you know lucky track record yeah, of course and, but I love that I love being able to find entrepreneurs at a very early stage I love being able to help them, you know, with everything and anything you can imagine really being one of them as a founder in a way so it's some of the companies, you know, buyers don't touch, of course, to this every day but some of them, you know, we have all the growing pains that they had suffered we've gone through it with them sure how tight was your relationship with your with your founders and your first investments? because, you know, it's all over the spectrum, some some investors like to be very hands on some of them are very, you know, talk to me every quarter well, what was extremely I mean, daily, almost daily oh wow yeah at least several times a week nowadays by the way, we're still very actively involved that's a fund also almost the same level of intensity because we believe that that's what we can provide apart from money, you know, it's the added value component but what I learned in that in that angel group, which is called the Tel Aviv Angel Group Yep Is the importance of working with your investors and getting as much added value from them as possible because everybody has the ability to be helpful to the companies they just need to be prone to be helpful totally and that's the point total, and you need to know how to motivate them and how to get their attention and all these people, even though likely this won't change their lifestyles if the company does incredibly well, they still want to be helpful and they find the companies interesting both and in an economic perspective, but also, you know, challenging in other forms out of interest they like to be helpful to the companies because they find what they're doing interesting right so what is that? what is maverick actually? What what does that name stands for? So Maverick Maverick actually sort of is the next generation the next step of the Tel Aviv Angel group that I've founded and the word maverick was chosen because of the dual meaning we all know what a maverick means in English, but in Hebrew maverick means ... to spark to shine, to be a you know a genius idea and that's what that's the the origin of this name so we're Maverick Ventures, Israel that's the name of the fund we have two funds our first fund was just a bit over 40 million dollars the second fund was over 75 million dollars wow and now we are in the process of fundraising for our third fund wonderful so how many companies have invested in so far? we've invested in 35 companies I believe wow last year was very, very active I think we were one of the most active funds if not the in Israel, but we don't tend to promote any of the deals that we do We're not against it if other firms do but we ourselves or the company does but we ourselves relatively shy away from proactive public relations at this time until, God willing, we succeed in one of the companies something interesting happens with one of the companies then we're very happy our approach is to try to be relatively as modest and we can at this stage so give me maybe, you know, two or two or three very quick intuitions that you're looking for as as you're as you're approaching due diligence about it I'm assuming this is more seed stage right no, we do early growth, our check size is usually up to five million dollars wow, ok, two to five million dollars is our so I no longer do the the stuff I did with the angel group we tried to go we we only look for companies that already have initial traction in revenue and we try to help them scale up as much as we can we have over 100 investors, 100 LPs so what I had before in the four to six investors in the Angel group so this is the same thing much bigger and all these people, as I said, some of them are extremely helpful you probably know several of them and they are people that come from all fields, from that academia, from different businesses we have businesswomen and men from really all walks of life that you can imagine so what what are some of the challenges of running a fund with over 100 LPs because on one hand you want to really utilize their their strong backgrounds and their expertise, whether it's in due diligence or in deal sourcing but at the same time, you sort of have to please a hundred different people and you know the saying, you put a hundred percent right two Jews in a room, you get six opinions so I can't imagine what they're not Jews, by the way they're not only Jewish people thank God we have people from all walks of life and all ethnicities, all backgrounds and happily the people who invest in Maverick, don't invest in Maverick because of the, say, ethnical aspect of it being you know a Jewish homeland and so on, they just think it's a place that they can get a high return on and then how do you balance how do you balance this expectation that you'll please everybody while at the same time never please anybody you never please anybody but you need to first of all, you need to do a few things, first and foremost and I say this to every person who wants to be coming out in the company is I bluntly tell them there's a very good chance you'll lose all your money investing in venture fund and in our venture fund it makes sense as well secondly, we try, we don't try to please them, but we do try to do is to do everything possible to reach the best outcome we can and to be a go between between their abilities and their connections and what the companies seek so each one of these investors in our mindset has the ability to be helpful to each one of the companies, to many of their companies, people who have gone through like imagine you in 10 years from now you'll you know, you will have your alumni association you'll have all the all the friends that you've had, your past jobs in education and so on and so forth and you'd like to be helpful to the companies well you'd also like us to be as respectful to your time as possible so we need to keep to make sure that we know exactly what each person could bring to the table on one hand and then the other hand, not to assume that you do not have connections to A juice manufacturer in Australia because maybe you randomly do and so we tried to sort of, you know, plan that thin line and be still very respectful to the to the LPs time and the way we do this is we send a quarterly report and then we have a to do a page at the very beginning with what with three points at each company, like assistance with so if it's interesting, say, staffing a position like if they're looking for a CFO to open an office in the east coast or they want, you know, a connection to this or that conglomerate or as anybody has you know experience in a specific tax question that they may have, and you will just notice, right, that oftentimes people have something to add and that's what differentiates us we act with the same passion that we had as an Angel group I want to believe we have the same thing now and when it's people's private money it's different than when you're, of course, than when you have raised money from institutionals and again, of course, not all the LPs are, you know, very active many of them surprise you of course, yeah no, I have to say that, you know, I'm a part I'm with Oded now at J-Ventures and I and we also we are a great guy yeah over 100 LPS and it's just so humbling to see that, you know, people are people are putting their time, their effort and I keep and it's amazing how much of it they put in and how willingly they want to help and when it's not, you know, for a salary of or because they have to, but because they want to, they raise their hand and say, yeah, I want to be a part of this, of this company and this due diligence or this or help this portfolio you see so much value that they bring and and you're right that out of, over hundred potential LPs, sometimes get these gems that are really random with a connection to a a juice manufacturer in Australia Yaron, I have to ask about ... United Hatzalah Group, one of the most inspiring organizations and entrepreneurship elements of Israel talk to me a little bit about it and what's your role over there? I will, just before I get into that, I want to go back one step and say that our LPs are from all over the place and thank, thank God, really one of the best things to have happen to remember, we said there is that moment when I got that phone call from my first partner yeah in an Angel group and then the second moment that I had was when I met who Michel Abadi, who was my partner, and has been my partner since the inception of the fund of Maverick he is originally from Brazil he lives in Israel, though, now for over 16 years, and his network spans of Latin America, which is a humungous area that people tend to forget yup you know, when it comes to this field and we have investors from Europe and from Australia, from other parts of the world so we're very heterogeneous in terms of the backgrounds of the LPs amazing and of course, I have really and him and I Michelle and I really complement each other and we work very well together that's something very important If I can give one tiny advice to all the you know aspiring new people watching if there's anyone watching that you know wants to set up a company of any kind is to always make sure to do that what is considered counter-intuitive, which is to not surround yourself by people that have the same backgrounds as you, that you know from school his background, he's an engineer by trade he's a banker he just we're very different and we are very, very close and really complement ourselves, wonderful wonderful about this, so also going back to the fact that we have only private investors, it's one of the second reason second reason we only have private investors first, of course, is their potential added value which has proven itself time to time again is the fact that we decided from the get go to donate two percent of our funds carry of the success of the fund to United Hatzalah, which you mentioned United Hatzalah in my opinion, is the most amazing organization that I've come across and I think that it embodies two things that are important to me and to everyone, which is, again, entrepreneurship, because what they do is very innovative what they decided to go against this flow yeah and secondly is a very basic essence of saving lives take action into their own hands what's that? taking action into their own hands literally bypassing not waiting for anyone else and what they do they started as a guerilla operation in a way and to them, too, I was introduced by that same farmer markers from the very beginning and what they do is they formed an organization which is similar to Uber if you think about it yup which is an organization that has over 6000 volunteers spread out throughout all of Israel and these are people that go around their day to day jobs or whatever they're doing and they have, and they are located they all have medical training and equipment and they are first responders first to get to the first responders stabilize, whoever is injured in car accidents, births heart attacks, stabbings, terror attacks God willing, God forbid and all of these other things and they get to eighteen hundred calls a day eighteen hundred calls a day? yeah and it's all for free they'll never charge anything from anyone ever They also have a few ambulances to help transport people who just can't pay are not able or not willing to pay for transport to a hospital and all and they just do good they have people who help with psychiatric help and psychological help, and they help Holocaust survivors they help the needy they are basically a bunch of angels that it's almost a matching organization and by the way, similar to startup, you want to make sure that their money that goes into them is spent in a lean manner, of course and that's something they could see their money there goes the vast, vast majority of it to buying medical supplies so you're not just, you're not just a fan you are you're on the board of of United yeah, I'm on the board for the past over a decade incredible there are many wonderful people and I've decided in my start of trumpet life to to only focus on one thing and to do it as well as you can and every single person that I meet, I introduced in praise and talk about this organization, because this organization is the essence of being a light onto the nations, which is what the Jewish people ought to be and this is one organization they are trying to setup all over the world this isn't a Jewish thing here we we have many, many Muslims and many, many Christians, many women, many male, chiaradia, which is the ultra-Orthodox totally secular people and we're doing the same thing all over the world where we want people to copy this we want this I myself was in Brazil when they opened it Lithuania New Jersey Jersey City in other parts of the world and this is exactly what we want we want Israel this is our exit of a startup company we want this to go global to go global I love it just save millions of lives I love it Yaron I can't believe we're already over 20 minutes it went by way, way too fast I have to put you on the spot once and and ask you for three words that you would best describe yourself or that others would describe you, whether it's Michelle or Ellie Bear from United Hatzalah what are three words that really embrace Yaron Carni annoying, good, funny and a good friend I love it to these two people I love it Yaron thank you so, so much stay safe stay healthy thank you for the inspiration thank you so much thank you
