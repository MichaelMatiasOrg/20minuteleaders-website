1 Okay. Wonderful. Okay. Sandra Clark, thank you for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? I am excellent. Thank you. A little warm today, but otherwise great. Definitely. Definitely a little warm. It's definitely some interesting times that we're living in. 2020 continues to surprise us. But over these next 20 minutes, you are going to help me become a little bit more knowledgeable about LinkedIn. So, a professional platform that most of the people that are listening to this use. It's something that I definitely enjoy using all the time. Not only because it helps me connect with others. But because I get exposed to what other people are working on. And one of the things that is becoming more and more apparent is that our social interaction is no longer just, the work-life balance is shifting. And all of a sudden, a lot of my personal connections are also on LinkedIn. And it's all becoming one big container and mixture. And I constantly am getting both spam messages and interesting messages. And I'm reaching out to people. They are reaching out to me. And the biggest question, this question of building the right resumes have been going on forever. Our LinkedIn is essentially our new resume. So, I'd love to spend these 20 minutes talking about what I can do to maximize on my appearance and professionalism on LinkedIn. But before that, Sandra, I'd love to talk about you learning how to swim. Talk to me about that. Okay. So, if I want to do something, I just decide somehow I'm going to do it. So, somehow managed to become an adult without ever learning to swim. My mother was afraid of water. She would never let me in the water. And I got this wonderful idea, I was living in Thailand, and it's great to scuba dive. But you sort of need to swim before you scuba dive. So, it was a little awkward. But I had a pool at the apartment complex. And I went to the pool. And then I'd never put my face under water voluntarily. So, I filled the sink in the bathroom with water and practice putting my head in, opening my eyes and teaching myself to swim. Became a scuba diver. Even became an instructor. So, it's  been the story of my life. You want to do something, figure out a way to do it. So, I just want to paint the picture that you're in the room and you're filling up the sink with water and you're putting your head down so that you can get over the fear of opening your eyes and putting your head underwater. Yes. I just love it. I've done stranger things. Well, if we have time in the end, I'll need to know one more strange thing. But then, the fact that you're not only scuba diving, but you're becoming a scuba diving instructor, I think that's a real inspiration. So, that's just a wonderful story. Sandra, how did you get started with your expertise in LinkedIn? What drew you to that? Well, it's almost another putting your head in the water story. I was laid off from the University of California, where I've been for 25 years. And at that point I thought I would stay. They had other ideas. They pushed me out of the nest. And who knew that I discovered I could fly. I started the whole job search thing and going to these classes to learn how to do a better resumé to interviews your Linkedin. And after the Linkedin training, people would be coming up to me say, "Could you just sit with me and help me?" "I don't seem to get it." "And I'm really struggling." So, after about 20 of these people I said, I should be charging. So, in the heart of Silicon Valley, we're all an entrepreneur. I'm a little late to the game. But I thought, why not? So, I started my own business on helping people set up LinkedIn. So, helping people set up LinkedIn. So, almost everybody, especially in Silicon Valley, has a LinkedIn account. It's sort of our signature. Like we said when we started out. Why do people need help with LinkedIn? I know why I need help with LinkedIn. But I want to know more about the general public why they need help with LinkedIn. Well, you'll be surprised. There are a lot of people that don't have LinkedIn. They've been at companies for so long, they never needed to. They just got recruited from company to company. They never needed to do that. And then, all of a sudden, they're walked out the door that day. All of their contacts are on their work email and they've got to start all over again. So, not everyone has one. But also a lot of people just, they threw it up there. Maybe they just copied everything on their resume and they go, "Okay. Good, I'm done. It's there." They're hugely uncomfortable about it. What should be there. What shouldn't be there. What should I do. And this whole social media for the socially reluctant is what I call it. Making yourself comfortable. Putting yourself out there online. So, not everybody is comfortable knowing how to do that. And then once you've got it there, what do you do with it. How do you build relationships. Connections. Who should you connect with. Something to say, "Oh, I only connect with people I really know well." "Well, I don't know about you but that would meant to be 30, 50 people from me." "Oh well, maybe I'll connect with people I've worked with." "Maybe that would be another hundred or so." So, you need to find a comfortable way to grow your network. And then a way to use LinkedIn appropriately. So, there's a lot of work in that. A lot of people want to be seen as a thought leader or manager of choice. Because just like managers are looking at your LinkedIn profile to consider hiring you, you're looking at them and saying, "Hey, do I want to work in this again." "Am I going to get to work on cool projects." "What's his career path." "Oh, the same job, five years." "That means no opportunities for me." So, it works both ways. And a lot of people, they don't necessarily want a new job. They want to be recognized for their expertise. So, I work with all of them. And I have way too much fun. I shouldn't even call it work. I just love it. So, give me a little bit more insight into the actual work that you do. Do you go on Zoom with them and you walk them through section by section? How do you draw on previous experiences? Are there certain patterns that you're seeing come up again? What are you noticing? Okay. Well, I do work on Zoom. I screen share. I do like a mini tutorial, and overview, best practices, ins-and-out, weirdnesses. There are a lot of weirdnesses on LinkedIn. And then I had over a control to them and watch over the shoulder directing them to make changes. But also putting them in control of their profile. A lot of times LinkedIn do things for you. They set up default. And you don't even know what's happened. You have people like they think they got their picture there, don't realize that they've got it set. So, no one can actually see their picture unless they're connected. Or they've got everything, their public view completely closed. So, it makes it very hard to find them. So, I teach them. I'm a teacher at heart. Once a teacher, always a teacher. And then, so, I teach them how to do it. And then I polished it up a little bit with them. So much they're uncomfortable. It feels like bragging about themselves. So, I helped them find wording that feels authentic and appropriate. And then how to use this, the physical how to post things so that you get notice as well as that what should you post. Why is nobody looking at it when you're just pushing stuff out there that you think is great and nobody cares. Well, you've got to engage in conversation. Not just push it out of them. So, teaching them how to do that is part of what I did also. So, Sandra, I think it would be wonderful to hear a few specific ideas of what my friends and I could do as we listen to this podcast or this interview. We go back to LinkedIn. What are some of the common pitfalls that you see people are making that first and foremost, we should be avoiding? Okay. Well, one of the most obvious is your headline. Right under your name, this area is actually called your headline. But the default to LinkedIn is when you add a new job, it writes just the job title. And your headline it's not called your job title. But LinkedIn does that to you or for you, depending on how you're feeling about it. And so, you are so much more than engineer XYZ corporation, owner. You want your keywords plus something about what you do. What you deliver to the company as an employee. Or what you deliver and offer as a business owner. So, headline is much reporting. When you comment on other people's content in LinkedIn, your name and your headline show. So, it's like a free advertisement. So, that's the number one thing. And it's always been true, but continues to be true. The other thing I would say, So, just one second about the headline. Because one of the things that my friends and I have been wondering is that we enjoy taking part in a lot of different activities that we're very proud of. We work at a certain company. We volunteer at a certain organization. We study at a certain school. Now, and then it stems the question, yeah, we could write a 50 character headline. But at some point, I'm sure that there is a drawback at having too much there. Or trying to come across as you're a little pushy. Or that you're too much in marketing and less in doing, right? So, what is the balance and how do you find that balance? Oh, gosh. That's the $50,000 question. So, LinkedIn add at the number of characters you should have. It used to be a 120 characters. Mine is actually about 100. Because I liked the way that sat on two lines. They've added now a 100 characters. So, that's 220 characters. Which is about four lines. In general, I don't like headlines that are that long. If you give me too much to read, I read nothing. So, I would edit it down a bit. Just like with your advertising on marketing grain, what are the key things about you. And there's an opportunity in your about section to tell your story. And that's where you can add in some of this more interesting content. But in the top, you want just enough to identify the key skills. Maybe something a little bit interesting about you to make people want to connect. What's different about you. I mean, if I see an application to connect and it says, six figures in six weeks. I know that she's going to sell me some automated products. And I don't even bother. So, that's obviously to sales over the top. You can talk about what you do. I talk about LinkedIn profiles for results. Which hopefully describes what I do, but not being very pushy about it. So, you have to find that balance. In general, I think a couple of lines are enough. Pick and choose what identifies you and then in your about section, tell me more. Because the about section has also changed. It used to be, we would go to your profile, we would see the whole, used to be, was it 1,500 characters. It's grown to 2,000 now. It's hard to keep track. But you don't really need that much. And you used to see all of it and you could go there and you could see someone's whole story just by scanning it. And that was great. But we don't see that now. We go to your profile we see the first three lines. So, now you've got that whole marketing advertising brain you have to use again. You've got to capture me in those first three lines. I don't know. But you've been in Silicon Valley. I don't reckon anybody ever clicks on the see more. So, you've got to either have your complete message in the first three lines, and or be so intriguing that we just got to open it and read more about you. So, how long does it take for you to work with a person to really understand who they are and what special thing they have to offer that would engage with their other audience or other people that they want to connect to? Because it sounds to me that a lot of this, while there is the practical understanding of the character limit and setting the settings correctly, the real added value here is understanding what in terms of marketing and messaging gets people to engage with your profile in your posts, right? Right. That's a great point. And I use the expression, walking is really just controlled falling. The idea being you start fall, you put a foot there, you catch yourself, you walk, you start to fall, you pick yourself. So, on social media, especially for some of us who are little more uncomfortable about being online, you've got to take a risk. You've just got to be out there. So, what I help people do is be a little brave. And take the words for now, this is not a lifetime commitment. This is not marriage. This is just pick what's true for now. So, I will help people identify what feels right to them right now. Knowing that they're not stuck with it, they can change it. And just think a little bit brave to do that. And that's really hard for people. So, sometimes if you go for counselling or psychotherapy, you go for months, years, whatever. I work with you for two hours and we get it done as long as people will come back to me for additional output. But for the most part, you know who you are right now. Let's pick those words. Try it out, throw it out there, and walk on. I'm not going to let you do anything embarrassing or wrong. But it's okay. Take a risk. Use the word. I'm working with a lot of executive coaches these days. I'm taking an executive coaching program. I've learned that that's probably not the right thing for me, because coaching, you're supposed to just listen. And I'm going to help you get it done. So, it may not be the right thing for me. But I work a lot with them. And there's a coach, he's so good and he works in a particular kind of harmonic leadership. Which is rather unique. Does everybody know what it is? No. But maybe they're going to be intrigue and ask him. So, be brave. That's what I teach. I think that's my value add. So then, the other sections that we didn't get to touch upon, which I believe is the experience, the volunteer, the awards, these sections are on the bottom of the page. I personally haven't spent much time discussing the different organizations that I volunteer my time for. The different awards that I received. Mainly because in my perception, most people are just not going to scroll that far down. Or maybe I have the wrong perception. But talk to me about these other sections. Are they important? And if so, what is the right positioning as we approach them? Yeah. Well, some of it It's like finding conversation starters. So, when you go to someone's profile, if you are both members of a group or an association, under the highlight section which is right near the top, it says that you're both members of this group or association. So, right away you've now got a conversation starter. So, that's a really great way to use it. If I do scroll down in your profile and I see, oh, you volunteer your time with the Boy Scouts of America, or whatever it is with now, it's like, oh, my kid was in Boy Scouts. You've got something to talk about. So, constantly looking for things you have in common. My goal on LinkedIn is never just to make a connection. It's always to start a conversation. A conversation that might lead to a relationship. And a relationship, if I'm lucky, might lead to the privilege of doing business with them. For someone in my world, my network is actually quite small. There are about 5,000 or so connections. And that sounds a lot to some people. But again, in my world, that's small. But that's because I don't want to just have numbers. I actually want to have real conversations with people. And I do. I connected with one of your former speakers after watching her talk. I told her why I was connecting with her. Now, we started a conversation about wine. I love it. I just love it. And is there an added benefit in having more followers? Because I see some people have tens of thousands of followers. Other people have 800. What are the pros and cons of having that very public appearance of how many people you're connected with? And a clarification which I need for myself, when it says the number of followers on a page, is that the number of connections? Or just the number of people that are interested in your profile? It's a combination. LinkedIn often uses the language interchangeably. Your connections are actually the people you are directly first to make connections with. Your followers are people who choose to follow you because they want to see your content, but you may not be connected with them. So, I've got about 5,000 connections and maybe another thousand followers. Because I write content about LinkedIn and people want to see that. But in other places it combines those two numbers. So, if I look at your profile and I see the number of followers. That would be the combination. In your case, probably most of them are actually connections. So, the number, the magic number. So, there is some value, algorithmically, if there is even such a word, in having over 500 connections. I just work with somebody yesterday, brand new user, he's being in the industry where he wasn't allowed to be on LinkedIn. So, he literally, starting from scratch, no connections. And I try to find examples for him to look at. And LinkedIn wouldn't let him look at those examples because his reach was not big enough. So, of course, once you connected with me, he's now only two degrees away from my 5,000. That just alone gives him more access. So, let's say 500 at least, just to make it easier to find people. In general, I say people should have at least 30 connections for every year of their age. So, I'll let you do your own math. You're a young man, so that's easy. I look at some people and I see the look of panic in their eyes as they realize what that number is. And the reason I use that number is because you meet 30 people professionally a year, I'm sure. Why would you not connect with them on LinkedIn? So, that's a starting point. If you're in business development, you're going to want a bigger number than that. If you want to be a thought leader and get your content. When you write content on LinkedIn, you write a post, it actually goes out to well, maybe 10% of all of your connections. And they only see it in the newsfeed if they happen to be looking at that time. So, 10% of 5,000 is  better than 10% better of 500. Now, you can increase that number from 10% to more like 25%. That's about the max by engaging on LinkedIn, the more you're active on LinkedIn. And that would be the other big thing I would tell people. You need to be engaged on LinkedIn. My name, Sandra Clark, it's actually very common. There's more than a thousand of me. Not look like me. In general, if you put my name, Sandra Clark, on the search bar, I'm going to come off as one of the top six suggested Sandra Clark's in the world. Because LinkedIn's algorithm says, hey, you're looking for a Sandra Clark, really good chance you're looking for this crazy lady. Because she's active on LinkedIn. And a guy who I was worked with yesterday, who had no connections, did that, and I came up first. I love it. I just love it. Sandra, 20 minutes go by fast. But I definitely learned a lot and I have to go back and fix a few things on my own LinkedIn. Oh, I'll be looking. Thank you very much for the insights and for being so generous with your time. Before we leave, I have to ask you my favorite question. Which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. Okay. I overthought this a little, but the obvious ones for me are mentor and empathetic. And after watching Mor Eini's interview, I have to join her with white wine. I love it. I just love it. Thank you very very much, Sandra. This is wonderful. And stay safe and stay healthy. Especially with all the fires that are happening today. Will do. Thank you so much. A pleasure talking with you. Wonderful. Bye bye.
