1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,000
In Hebrew you say, "meharagelayim"

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,560
like by your feet.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,080
And you have to experience it yourself.

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,160
You have to push yourself

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,920
to your limits and understand that, like,

6
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,080
there's more that you can do.

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,160
You don't have to succumb

8
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,640
to the stress, pressure or whatever

9
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,880
is in front of you at the moment.

10
00:00:41,186 --> 00:00:41,756
Nuri Golan,

11
00:00:41,757 --> 00:00:42,520
thank you so much

12
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:43,840
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,120
How are you today?

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,600
I'm good.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,000
How are you?

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,120
I'm doing great.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,250
I'm very jealous of you.

18
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:51,640
You get to meet Shuly and Gil

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,520
on an ongoing basis.

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,560
And I miss them so much

21
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,040
ever since I came back to Israel

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,840
for the covid times.

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,080
So, please send them

24
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,400
my love and my regards.

25
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,880
But enough about them.

26
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,560
Nuri, such a fascinating journey

27
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,400
that you've taken.

28
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,720
And perhaps one of the most

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,880
fascinating pieces of it

30
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,160
is right in the beginning

31
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,160
as a captain in the Israeli Navy Seals,

32
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,800
turning into running R&D

33
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
for that same unit.

34
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,960
And then the boring stuff,

35
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,600
selling a company

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,720
and creating another startup,

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,880
sitting on advisory boards.

38
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,040
But that's the boring stuff.

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,440
Let's go back to the beginning.

40
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,960
Nuri, how do you get

41
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,000
to be a combat officer in the Navy Seals?

42
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,720
Lots of reasons for wanting to do that,

43
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,040
but most importantly, you know,

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,920
I grew up in a very zionist family.

45
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,320
A lot of my uncles and my dad

46
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,640
all served in the Israeli military.

47
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,520
So, when I was a teenager,

48
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,680
I started to think about it

49
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,680
and then I actually was within Israel

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,440
during the second Lebanon war in 2006.

51
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,800
And it was a really

52
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,120
interesting experience being there.

53
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,640
I think I was 19 at the time.

54
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,560
And everyone your age

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,680
is kind of out at war.

56
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,800
And so, being there

57
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,320
and having a good time in Tel Aviv,

58
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
but not seeing anybody your age

59
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,520
really has an impact on you.

60
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,760
And someone who always

61
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,000
kind of thought about wanting to serve

62
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,560
and do something

63
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,360
a little bit bigger than me,

64
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,960
that was the kind of the straw

65
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,680
that broke the camel's back

66
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,960
and I decided I wanted

67
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,600
to join the Israeli military.

68
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,920
So, I finished my degree.

69
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,440
So, I was studying

70
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,680
at George Washington University

71
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,600
at the time, aerospace engineering.

72
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,440
So, I spent another two years

73
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,960
completing my degree.

74
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,200
And then in 2008,

75
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,280
I got on a plane with my cousin

76
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,505
and the two of us made Aliyah

77
00:02:33,506 --> 00:02:34,840
and joined.

78
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,520
And then I thought

79
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,760
I was only going to go for two years

80
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,875
and then come back to the US.

81
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:43,120
And you ended up at nine.

82
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,600
Yeah. I got accepted

83
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,200
to the Navy SEAL entry exam.

84
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,360
And on my way there somebody told me,

85
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,440
"Do you know that this is

86
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,840
at least five years service."

87
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,677
And I said,

88
00:02:53,678 --> 00:02:55,960
"I didn't know that, but okay."

89
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,320
And once I passed and they admitted me

90
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,120
and invited me to start training,

91
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,360
I just couldn't give up the opportunity.

92
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,080
Nuri, I have to say that, you know,

93
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,480
I'm sure that

94
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,760
a lot of my friends in Israel

95
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,840
who are going to be listening to this

96
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,040
are already getting frustrated

97
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,120
because, you know,

98
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,360
it's known how insanely difficult it is

99
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,800
to get accepted to the Navy SEALs.

100
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,200
You know, the gibush is one of the most

101
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,720
notorious difficult experiences

102
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,760
that any young 18 or 17 year-olds

103
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,320
can go through

104
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,840
and getting accepted there is remarkable.

105
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,800
And I'm sure that it's quite a big shock

106
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,120
also coming from university,

107
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,640
studying aerospace engineering

108
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,200
and landing all of a sudden

109
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,320
in this five, six year program

110
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,080
where you're literally,

111
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,520
you know, drinking seawater

112
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,160
and eating sand.

113
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,120
Talk to me a little bit about

114
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,880
this experience of going

115
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,760
from George Washington University

116
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,280
straight into the Navy SEALs.

117
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,520
Well, it's definitely a shock.

118
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,840
There were many moments

119
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
where I stood there.

120
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,155
I think one of the,

121
00:03:53,156 --> 00:03:55,350
during the five day entry exam,

122
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:57,160
the gibush,

123
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:58,640
at one point, it was like

124
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,080
there was a lightning storm out

125
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,589
and they were

126
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,000
making us running out of the water.

127
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,160
And I was holding this giant,

128
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,360
like metal anchor.

129
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,760
And they told me

130
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,880
to go throw it in the water

131
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,320
so we could go

132
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,320
like, run around it in circles.

133
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,080
And I'm like looking up at the sky,

134
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
thinking I'm about to get hit

135
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,960
by lightning carrying this giant thing.

136
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
And I'm like, what the hell

137
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:16,119
am I doing here?

138
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,680
How did I get here?

139
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,600
But, you know, at the time, again,

140
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,480
I was 21 at the time

141
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,120
I was locked in, focused.

142
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,200
This is what I wanted to do.

143
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,840
And so, you know,

144
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,240
that kind of takes over

145
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,640
any of the critical thinking parts

146
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
of your brain

147
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,360
and you just kind of run with it.

148
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,000
It's definitely a challenge

149
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,880
for me at least.

150
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,240
Like some of the most challenging parts

151
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,480
weren't necessarily the physical pieces

152
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,720
but dealing with, you know,

153
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,160
having officers and commanders

154
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,760
who were younger than me.

155
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,000
Who didn't really have a ton

156
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,280
of life experience, you know,

157
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,560
it was really funny.

158
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,160
Like, I had a degree, again,

159
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,840
I wasn't exactly like the most mature

160
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,280
and sophisticated person in the world,

161
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,400
but I had an engineering degree

162
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,280
and people are looking at me

163
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,360
like I'm only going to start my college

164
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,440
in like five or six years

165
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,840
after I finished the US military,

166
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,200
go travel for two years,

167
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,920
take a year off.

168
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,560
So, that for me,

169
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,680
was one of the most difficult parts.

170
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,400
So, just for context,

171
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
I want to move forward on your journey

172
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,960
just so we can get the context

173
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,560
as to the type of person you are.

174
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:16,120
But then I really want to circle back

175
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,560
and go back

176
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,320
to these extraordinary lessons

177
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,040
that one can learn

178
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,000
in the combat unit.

179
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,760
Because the truth be told,

180
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,400
most of Israelis in the tech scene,

181
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,240
especially those

182
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,400
that are in Silicon Valley,

183
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,760
they're not coming

184
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,480
from these elite combat unit.

185
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,880
So, a lot of them are coming from,

186
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,560
you know, 8200, 81,

187
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,880
all those elite technological units.

188
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,320
And so, I'm extremely excited

189
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,640
to hear your perspective

190
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,120
on the different leadership lessons.

191
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,960
But walk me through some

192
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,680
of the different experiences you've had,

193
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,480
like with EXO that was acquired by Lear,

194
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,840
and then sitting on advisory boards

195
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,840
in your most recent startup.

196
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:52,840
Are you asking

197
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,920
about those experiences specifically, or?

198
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,600
Yeah.

199
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,120
Give me the rundown of what happened

200
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,600
since you left,

201
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,560
just so we can get the context.

202
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,120
So, I finished my service.

203
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,240
And I always, like startup world

204
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,000
and entrepreneurship

205
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,480
was something that was always

206
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,320
interesting to me.

207
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,240
And I ended up doing my MBA

208
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,640
at the Technion which had a startup

209
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,880
in innovation program, specifically.

210
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,400
Casual.

211
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,480
And so, that kind of is

212
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,440
where everything started.

213
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,680
They basically tell you, like,

214
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,400
you should start a company

215
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,000
and use this as an incubator for,

216
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,720
you know, to build your idea.

217
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,600
And so, I was lucky enough

218
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,160
to meet a couple of partners.

219
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,280
One of which was the guy

220
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,360
who led the GPS squadron

221
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
in the US Air Force.

222
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,520
So, he had some ideas

223
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,120
about how to improve the accuracy of GPS.

224
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,080
Obviously, that was

225
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,000
like, okay, this can be a very big deal.

226
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,080
And so, we started a company around it.

227
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:46,000
And yeah, like the

228
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,280
lessons in the training

229
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,080
that you get in the military,

230
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,920
in my opinion,

231
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,960
are some of the best

232
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,440
that an entrepreneur can get.

233
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,400
Like, you're right,

234
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,720
when I go around in Silicon Valley,

235
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,040
pitching a VC, they ask me,

236
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,153
"Were you in 8200? Were you in 81?"

237
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:58,880
you know,

238
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,240
they already know those buzzwords.

239
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,977
And I was like,

240
00:07:00,978 --> 00:07:01,960
"Oh no, I was in 13."

241
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,802
They were like, "What is that?"

242
00:07:02,803 --> 00:07:05,840
I'm like, the opposite end of the spectrum.

243
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:07,280
But I think that, you know,

244
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,000
like the training that you do

245
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,680
you're used to working under

246
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,200
serious time constraints,

247
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,080
never knowing what the next minute

248
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,640
is going to be,

249
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,360
let alone the next week or month.

250
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,000
You know, intense conditions,

251
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,200
everything is up and down

252
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,520
and you have to learn to keep yourself

253
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,240
kind of really levelheaded.

254
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:25,280
And so, I think, like

255
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,640
the best entrepreneur lessons

256
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,920
I ever learned were in the training

257
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,320
that I got in the military.

258
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,400
And I think that helped me,

259
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,440
you know, through EXO where

260
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,040
we are trying to sell deep tech company

261
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,920
or the technology product to a lot of,

262
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,640
to like the automotive industry,

263
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,200
which was at the time, you know,

264
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,720
it's still a very difficult industry

265
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,280
to sell into especially for startups.

266
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,720
You have a lot of highs and lows

267
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,800
and being able to manage that

268
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,720
is one of the most critical parts

269
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,960
of running an early stage startup.

270
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,240
Right.

271
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,280
So, you've done that,

272
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,080
you've done it once,

273
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,560
you're doing it again now, at Sosivio.

274
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,520
What is Sosivio?

275
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,200
So, Sosivio is a autonomous cloud

276
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,080
native platform.

277
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,240
So, it helps you manage your,

278
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,280
it's like a next generation

279
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,360
of observability tool

280
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,120
for managing your online

281
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,920
and cloud native services.

282
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,400
And so we help any company of any size,

283
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,000
generally some of the larger companies

284
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,840
that are moving

285
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,200
into the cloud more and more

286
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,280
so, keep their applications running

287
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,920
and keeping their environments optimized.

288
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,000
So, it sounds like

289
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,240
it's definitely sounds like something

290
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,880
that's necessary to do.

291
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,120
But, what is the problem?

292
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,920
Because, you know,

293
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,240
from most people's perspective,

294
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,120
we look at all the big tech companies

295
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,840
that we have today,

296
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,080
obviously, they're running in the cloud

297
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
and obviously every startup

298
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,480
is starting out in the cloud.

299
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,880
I think people will quickly forget

300
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,240
that the majority of the world

301
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,480
is not in the cloud.

302
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,640
I don't know exactly what percentage,

303
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
maybe you can enlighten me,

304
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,280
but I still believe that

305
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,840
a lot of the big core enterprises

306
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,280
that we've seen, that we've rolled in

307
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,840
from the 20th century

308
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,320
have yet to make that transition.

309
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,640
Am I right?

310
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:53,880
Well, yeah.

311
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,520
I mean, cloud is just also

312
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,480
one of those terms that

313
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,440
you don't know exactly what you mean.

314
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,120
Like cloud, a lot of people today,

315
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,640
they think that means

316
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,600
you're running on AWS

317
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,840
or Google or Azure.

318
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,640
But really like anything that

319
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,720
where you're running an application,

320
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,160
not on your own computer

321
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
is cloud technically.

322
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,400
Right?

323
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,240
Like you're running

324
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
something somewhere else.

325
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,160
And to do that,

326
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,000
you have to use

327
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,160
a ton of different software

328
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,440
and services and tools

329
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,640
to help keep it running smoothly.

330
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,280
And so, observability

331
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,560
is one piece of that world

332
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,640
which is just helping keep your services

333
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,120
up and running.

334
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,920
Like everyone's had the experience where

335
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,960
they are using an application,

336
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,360
it could be a banking app on your phone

337
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,800
and it just crashes on you.

338
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,520
Like, why did that happen,

339
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,280
why does it happen only

340
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,360
once out of 100 times.

341
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,320
Well, there could be a number

342
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,080
of circumstances

343
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
in how the environment is operating,

344
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,800
where in that one moment

345
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,120
when enough people are using it,

346
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
the system crashes.

347
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,520
And so, what we do is we are able

348
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,480
to figure out much earlier

349
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,240
before those failures materialize,

350
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,160
like what's going on

351
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,880
and whether or not

352
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,160
something's going to happen.

353
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,240
So, we predicted ahead of time

354
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,400
and help you make sure it doesn't affect

355
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
your customers experience.

356
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,080
Wow. And where are you at

357
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,240
with that journey right now?

358
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,124
So, I know that

359
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,480
your a part of Upwest Labs,

360
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,760
a phenomenal, phenomenal group.

361
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,720
But what's been the journey like

362
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,440
for Sosivio?

363
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,040
Yeah, I mean, the company was started

364
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,840
earlier this year.

365
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,920
Me and one of my co-founders from EXO,

366
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,350
and then Adam, Avi, and Liran

367
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:18,200
are the other co-founders, started it up.

368
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,600
We raised a little bit of money.

369
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,120
We're raising money again right now,

370
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,840
which is always a fun process

371
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,640
and starting to build it out.

372
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,760
We have a core product

373
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,040
that's being released.

374
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,600
And we're working

375
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,920
with a number of partners already.

376
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,240
So, it's very exciting time.

377
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,360
And what's been the most

378
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,120
biggest learning experience

379
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,040
or the learning curve

380
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,040
that you had to adapt to

381
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,400
as you are transitioning?

382
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,520
Because on one,

383
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,280
it is very different

384
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,440
from everything else you've done, right?

385
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,160
I understand coming

386
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,120
from a military background

387
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,600
when we still have to talk

388
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,000
about the leadership experience

389
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,160
that you have gained there,

390
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,760
but I understand the technical background

391
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,000
you've gained there.

392
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,800
The GPS deep technology

393
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,680
military application

394
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,840
makes a lot of sense.

395
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,640
And now you're moving on

396
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,080
to helping big enterprises

397
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,520
make a transition towards

398
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,800
the cloud world

399
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,360
with predictive analysis

400
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,320
on when things might go wrong.

401
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,280
It doesn't connect in my mind.

402
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,040
Help me work this out.

403
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,760
I mean,

404
00:11:13,761 --> 00:11:15,600
you don't always have to be

405
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,640
the industry expert yourself

406
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,600
to run a successful business or startup.

407
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
I think that, you know,

408
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,960
there's a lot of other factors

409
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,640
you can talk about,

410
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,760
like leadership, right?

411
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,400
Like having someone

412
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,360
who can just steer the ship

413
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,960
in the right way,

414
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,000
know how to build the company

415
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,920
in the right way,

416
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,280
and bring in the right people

417
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,000
and the right experience,

418
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,480
the right talent.

419
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,120
That's critically important.

420
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,240
And so, this is a brand new space for me,

421
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,040
which is a challenge,

422
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,960
and it's actually a challenge

423
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,920
that I embrace it.

424
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,520
You know, I was excited about

425
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,320
trying something new

426
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,880
and not just staying in the same field

427
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,040
for the rest of my life.

428
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,080
For me, like what I want to do

429
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,920
is I want to continuously build companies

430
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,000
and learn of it.

431
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,600
But one of the cool things

432
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,320
about doing this is that

433
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,640
you get to learn a whole new space

434
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,840
and you get to learn

435
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,280
a whole new world of technology,

436
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,200
a whole new world of people.

437
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,680
And that to me is exciting.

438
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,720
So, it's not that there's

439
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,280
a direct connection between GPS

440
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,400
and cloud services,

441
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,960
it's more that the recipe for building

442
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,040
a good startup is pretty much the same

443
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,960
no matter what industry you're in.

444
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,680
And it sounds to me like the key ingredient

445
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,520
all the way from studying aerospace

446
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,080
in George Washington to go

447
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,400
into the Navy SEALs

448
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,320
to running R&D in the Navy SEALs

449
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,240
to selling a GPS company

450
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,120
to now doing this as curiosity.

451
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,200
I mean, it sounds like

452
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,120
you're just passionate

453
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,440
about whatever you're doing.

454
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,720
You are embracing that challenge.

455
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,000
You mentioned before

456
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,200
when you were just doing that gibush,

457
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,360
that you're sort of trained your mind

458
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,080
to stop that critical thinking

459
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,280
and to embrace the challenge

460
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,640
and to run headfirst.

461
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,120
And it sounds like

462
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,520
there's a lot of parallelism

463
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,600
to what you experienced

464
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,920
going into perhaps

465
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,880
one of the most difficult

466
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,800
units of the IDF

467
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,200
and one of the most prestigious units

468
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,120
to running a startup.

469
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,640
Am I right?

470
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,800
Yeah. I mean, there's

471
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,880
I'm a pretty analytical person.

472
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,680
I like to sit down

473
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,240
and think through problems.

474
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,160
But there comes a time where

475
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,400
you need to just run through a wall.

476
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,440
And I think that's like

477
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,160
one of the things that going through

478
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,400
you know,

479
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,000
the Israeli Navy SEALs really helps you

480
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,400
like, you can think about

481
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,680
every aspect of a problem

482
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,320
and you can have a perfect strategy.

483
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,920
Occasionally you're just going to come up

484
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,280
against an obstacle

485
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,520
and you need to get through it

486
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,320
in whatever way possible.

487
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:24,720
And I think that's a piece that

488
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,120
you know, it's not something

489
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,280
you can teach someone or tell someone.

490
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,920
They can only learn it on their own.

491
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,520
Like in Hebrew you say, "meharagelayim",

492
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,440
like by your feet.

493
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,920
You have to experience it yourself.

494
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,440
You have to push yourself to your limits

495
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,600
and understand that, like

496
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,920
there's more that you can do,.

497
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,880
You don't have to succumb to the stress,

498
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,000
pressure or whatever's in front of you

499
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,400
at the moment.

500
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,651
Right. That makes a lot of sense.

501
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:46,920
I'm thinking back

502
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,680
to some experiences I had.

503
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,520
I came from 8200.

504
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,000
I wish I came from,

505
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,840
like an experience like the Navy SEALs.

506
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,040
Unfortunately, I probably couldn't get in

507
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,560
even if I applied.

508
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,160
But I remember that

509
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,960
a lot of the times we had these struggles

510
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,360
and we had to develop these technologies

511
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,080
and we just didn't have the funds

512
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,560
to do them.

513
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,240
And we said, okay, well,

514
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,720
we need this server,

515
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
we need this technology

516
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,440
and we need this type of person.

517
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,400
And I would go to my commander

518
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,800
and he would say, okay, no, no,

519
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,840
and unfortunately no.

520
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,600
So, good luck.

521
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,360
You still have a week to get it done.

522
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:16,560
Right?

523
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,840
So, at that point, you're saying,

524
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,600
okay, there's a wall

525
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,920
and you just have to break it.

526
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,520
What's leadership like

527
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,880
in the Navy SEALs?

528
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,480
What is it like being a combat leader?

529
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
Well, you know, by the way,

530
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:32,360
being a combat leader

531
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,880
and being like a startup leader

532
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,480
are two very different things.

533
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,440
And I would actually argue that

534
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,920
that being a startup leader

535
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,200
or in the business world

536
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,480
can actually be more difficult

537
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,120
in a lot of ways.

538
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,200
Being a combat leader, you know,

539
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,120
like in the military,

540
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,440
you have a rank, you have authority,

541
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,640
like there is some things that are given

542
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,800
from the beginning that make it

543
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,600
a little bit easier.

544
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,480
Where in the business world,

545
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,000
especially in the Israeli business world,

546
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,600
you have to earn your place

547
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,000
because people will challenge you

548
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,720
all the time.

549
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,640
And so, you know,

550
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,360
at the end of the day,

551
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,800
like in the military, yes,

552
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,440
you'll have the rank

553
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,480
and you'll have the position,

554
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,480
but you need to own up to it.

555
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,680
Like you need to protect your people,

556
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,200
you need to be, you know,

557
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,240
lead by example,

558
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,600
if I had to boil it all down

559
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,160
to like one point,

560
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,640
it would be lead by example.

561
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,080
Like, if you

562
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,360
preach to people certain things,

563
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,080
you don't hold yourself

564
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,600
to the same standards,

565
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,280
you'll be toast in no time

566
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,600
because the people won't respect you.

567
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,320
So, for me, that was like

568
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
the guiding light always was.

569
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,960
Whatever I asked my teams to do

570
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,280
or my people to do,

571
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,000
I better make sure

572
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,800
that I hold myself

573
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,400
to that exact same standard.

574
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,920
And if you do,

575
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,560
there's really never going to be

576
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,760
complaints from the people below you.

577
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,880
Because if you're doing it,

578
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,960
then why shouldn't they.

579
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,160
Right?

580
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,480
If you're the higher rank,

581
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,120
if you're the person

582
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,520
who should have the better benefits,

583
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,560
better things, like

584
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,160
they have no reason to complain.

585
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,762
Right. And I think

586
00:15:53,763 --> 00:15:54,800
one of the very special things

587
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,320
also about these different amazing units

588
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,040
in the IDF is that

589
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,880
a lot of the times

590
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,320
the commanders are the ones

591
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,720
who are doing the heavy lifting early on.

592
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,360
And especially, I know in my unit

593
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,240
and I'm sure also in the Navy SEALs

594
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,560
that the people that are promoted,

595
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
that are commanding

596
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,840
and are leading the teams

597
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,240
are people that were, perhaps,

598
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,840
the best soldiers and the best

599
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,960
that both mentally and physically

600
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,160
and emotionally.

601
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,840
So, I'm definitely sure of that.

602
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,160
What about the hand tackling?

603
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,800
It's different type of challenge?

604
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,320
You know, when you take a team

605
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,240
that is tired,

606
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,200
that is beaten down

607
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,120
and now you have to take that metal bar

608
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,840
and run into the sea and throw it.

609
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,240
It's a very different task

610
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,320
than guiding somebody to work late,

611
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,960
to deploy a new version or fix a bug.

612
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,600
It must be very different.

613
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,320
Yeah. I mean, of course.

614
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,600
Look, one of the good,

615
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,400
we talk about the differences

616
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,560
between business leadership

617
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,520
and combat leadership,

618
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,840
in the military unit,

619
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,040
one of the advantages is that everybody

620
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,720
has a very clear common mission.

621
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,400
Which is another

622
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,200
very important aspect of leadership.

623
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,800
It's like a business unit.

624
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,320
The business all the time about

625
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,240
what's the business's

626
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,040
mission statement

627
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,000
and what are you about.

628
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,800
And that is an attempt to solidify

629
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,960
a group around a common cause.

630
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,800
In the military,

631
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,840
you have that built in.

632
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,280
It's like, okay,

633
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,560
we all know what we're here for.

634
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,600
Especially in Israel, right?

635
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,240
We're here to make sure

636
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,320
that the country survives till next year.

637
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,920
So, you know,

638
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,240
it's about making everybody understand

639
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,040
that that's what they're there for.

640
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,800
The risk and the circumstances

641
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,560
are obviously a lot more significant

642
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,240
in a combat role.

643
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,280
And so, you know,

644
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,440
that helps in some ways too,

645
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,760
because you become a lot closer

646
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,840
to the people you're around.

647
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,840
Like the brotherhood that you build

648
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,720
in the fraternity of the teams

649
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,400
that you work with.

650
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,000
You know, even to this day, like,

651
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,440
I obviously have a lot of good friends

652
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,320
who weren't in the military,

653
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,520
but friends who did serve,

654
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,760
especially friends who served,

655
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,640
you know, on the front line,

656
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,040
it doesn't matter

657
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,720
if they were special forces or not.

658
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,840
There's a different kind

659
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,800
of connection there.

660
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,440
Again, that's no disrespect

661
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,680
to anyone who didn't serve

662
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,560
in those roles but,

663
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,560
there's something there

664
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,000
that you just can't recreate

665
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,040
in the outside world.

666
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,200
And even in the business world,

667
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,960
it's very difficult to do that.

668
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,720
100%.

669
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,920
My father was a pilot.

670
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,551
I guess maybe 40 years ago

671
00:18:12,552 --> 00:18:13,680
in the Air Force.

672
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,040
And there's not a week goes by

673
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,520
where he doesn't mention

674
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,800
an amazing friend

675
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,640
that he had in the course, as if,

676
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,520
as if they did

677
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,920
a program together last week.

678
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,240
And you can feel the bond

679
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
that people are creating

680
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,560
this lifelong partnership

681
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,040
which it's just phenomenal.

682
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,960
You had a short stint in venture capital.

683
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,640
Something that

684
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,560
not a lot of entrepreneurs get.

685
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,120
And you are as young as you are,

686
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,960
so, how was that?

687
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,920
Was it fun?

688
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,240
Was it enlightening?

689
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,840
Did you benefit from that towards

690
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,400
the next startup?

691
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,320
Yeah, absolutely.

692
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,760
It was, first of all, I think,

693
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,400
as most of the venture capitalists

694
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,280
usually come from

695
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,040
an entrepreneurial role of some kind.

696
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,280
I think it's incredibly important

697
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,000
to have been on the other side,

698
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,280
to see what the startup is like.

699
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,800
You look at things a lot differently

700
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,520
on that side than

701
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,440
when you're on the entrepreneur side.

702
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,120
You really like,

703
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,200
you can see when a startup is maybe,

704
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,560
you know,

705
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,080
extending the truth a little bit

706
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,600
or you know, things pop out at you

707
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,800
that maybe they didn't before.

708
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,960
I know I'm sure that these guys

709
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,800
are having this problem

710
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,360
and just by the way

711
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,680
that they're speaking about it.

712
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,400
So, it's invaluable experience.

713
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,200
And then now back

714
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,320
on the entrepreneur side,

715
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,000
it's also very, very valuable

716
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,800
because now,

717
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,720
you know, when you go to pitch a VC

718
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,200
you know what they're looking for,

719
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,080
you know how busy they are,

720
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,400
you know how like

721
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,680
sometimes their attention spans

722
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,560
can just be completely

723
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,160
too short to really listen to you.

724
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,520
So, you know, kind of where

725
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,240
the heart is in and where to focus

726
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,800
and it's certainly like incredible.

727
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,120
I recommend that both sides

728
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,200
do both roles.

729
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,480
I think it will just be more productive

730
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,080
for everyone.

731
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,800
When I was doing that role at Lear,

732
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,240
I felt from the entrepreneurs as well

733
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,920
that they appreciated it as well,

734
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,920
like having, especially

735
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,000
in corporate venture capital.

736
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,200
Because that's typically

737
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,960
where you don't get, like, entrepreneurs,

738
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,080
in a VC, again, like I was saying,

739
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,280
usually they have some

740
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,200
entrepreneurial experience.

741
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,320
In a corporate venture capital world,

742
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,000
not a lot of them have their own

743
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,400
entrepreneurial experience.

744
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,920
Because they're coming in from

745
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,840
internally within the organization.

746
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,560
Yes.

747
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,480
I was kind of an out and I didn't stay.

748
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,160
I was only a leader

749
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,040
for two and a half years.

750
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,440
But a lot of entrepreneurs who acquired

751
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,240
either move, you know,

752
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,400
they stay in the operations role

753
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,280
of running that business

754
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,480
or eventually they phase out.

755
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,920
I grew the team within Lears of EXO

756
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,320
and then eventually joined

757
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,000
and helped launch

758
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,080
the innovation organization

759
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,480
and took over the venture capital part.

760
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,760
But that was unique

761
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,480
or definitely not the norm,

762
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,880
I would say.

763
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,200
Wow.

764
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,800
Nuri, I want to thank you

765
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,320
for being so generous with your time.

766
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,720
Really, really wonderful.

767
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,440
Before we go, I have to ask you

768
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,000
for the most important question,

769
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,800
which is three words

770
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,960
that you would use to describe yourself.

771
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,800
I'm particularly curious

772
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,200
to hear what you have to say

773
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,240
because of your extraordinary experience.

774
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,880
I would say competitive is number one.

775
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,720
Most people who,

776
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,000
do have to explain them

777
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,920
or just give you the words?

778
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,040
If you can explain in a short sentences,

779
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,400
I would love that.

780
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
Most people who know me

781
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,680
know that I'm extremely competitive

782
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,000
about everything.

783
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,760
And I joke including about

784
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,680
who's more competitive, so.

785
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,960
We're going to save this competition

786
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,000
for the next episode

787
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,720
because we have a competition

788
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,920
going on here.

789
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,000
Yeah.

790
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,280
Disciplined, I would say number two.

791
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,960
Where again, like,

792
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,680
especially in entrepreneurship

793
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,720
and obviously in the military,

794
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,640
like being disciplined to yourself

795
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,960
not just the outside world,

796
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,760
like again, holding yourself to standards.

797
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,240
Even when you tell people a certain thing

798
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,080
like, Hey, you got to wake up

799
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,520
at this time,

800
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,000
you got to do this, this and this,

801
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,080
a lot of times people aren't going

802
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,080
to be there to see you or do it.

803
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,440
And it's, you know,

804
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,600
still important to hold yourself

805
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,520
to the same standards

806
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,480
because, it's not about

807
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,440
actually doing those things.

808
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,920
It's about the mentality of like,

809
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,240
here's what we're going to do to it.

810
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,480
And then three, I would say dedicated.

811
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,840
Something else that drives me a lot,

812
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,680
is when I get into something,

813
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,320
I'm in it fully.

814
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,240
So, that's I guess number three.

815
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,200
Nuri, I knew you wouldn't disappoint

816
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,040
those three words,

817
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,960
Nuri, toda raba.

818
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,200
Thank you very, very much.

819
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,440
By the way, I think

820
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,480
that those three words

821
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,800
didn't come up in any

822
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,400
of the other 250 episodes.

823
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,320
Because this was a very special episode,

824
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,720
it's one that's very dear to my heart

825
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,160
because as I traverse along my journey,

826
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,720
especially in Palo Alto,

827
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,640
sometimes it's not easy to explain

828
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,880
the experience of being

829
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,240
in an organization like the IDF.

830
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,160
And it's also a different,

831
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,200
I think, from a lot of other

832
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,440
military experiences as well.

833
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,400
I have friends who served

834
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,040
in different militaries.

835
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,600
This innovation through necessity,

836
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,520
this discipline, this being,

837
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,200
you know, I remember when I enlisted

838
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,680
and the first week that I enlisted,

839
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,640
I came as 19 straight from Palo Alto.

840
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,800
I was doing a year there

841
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,600
with Professor Dan Ariely.

842
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,320
I had a 19 year old girl

843
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,760
who was screaming at me for forgetting

844
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,080
to tie my shoes a certain way.

845
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
And I remember that moment

846
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,880
that it just dawned on me that, okay,

847
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,400
this is a new reality

848
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,800
and we're going to do some great things.

849
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,880
And it was a fantastic experience.

850
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,520
Nuri, Thank you very much.

851
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,280
It was a pleasure.

852
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,080
Thank you.

853
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
Thanks for having me.

854
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,520
Good luck.
