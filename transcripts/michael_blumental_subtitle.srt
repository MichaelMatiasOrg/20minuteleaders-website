1
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,480
Michael Blumenthal, thank you so much

2
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,200
for being on my show.

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,040
How are you?

4
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,280
I'm great. How are you, Michael?

5
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,600
Thank you so much for having me

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,320
on your wonderful show.

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,480
I am fantastic.

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,920
But you actually go by Michael

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,680
in the US right now, Michael?

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,000
Very true.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,080
Michael in Israel, Michael in the US.

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,000
But I just moved here.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,880
Everyone thought I would go by Michelle.

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,160
I just didn't feel like a Michelle.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,520
Michael is a good conversation starter

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,320
and it's memorable.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,280
Which is always good for business.

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,400
I love it. I love it.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,680
Memorable. Always good for business.

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,240
Okay. So, we have to start

21
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,480
with this fun fact

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,320
which we've already shared

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,240
with our audience.

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,920
But folk dancing Hora,

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,080
most people watching this

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,600
are not going to know what Hora is,

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,000
even if they're from Israel.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,320
So, we have to spend a few minutes

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,640
talking about folk dancing.

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,440
What is this

31
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,560
and why have you been doing this

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,920
for 14 years, professionally?

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,680
Professionally.

34
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,960
Everyone thinks the Israeli folk dancing

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,240
as just the bigger group of people

36
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,720
dancing in a circle, right?

37
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,120
So, that's not what it is, it's actually

38
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,480
a very professional thing to do.

39
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
With the company,

40
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,320
we performed all over the world.

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,600
So, when I was 15, we went to Brazil

42
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,480
for a whole month.

43
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,280
And we performed

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,360
in Paris, Berlin, Russia, even.

45
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,560
So, and it's a great thing to do.

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,480
It's really built my character,

47
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,360
I have to say.

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,760
So, give me a little bit of context

49
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,280
into what it actually is, tangibly.

50
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,040
So, it's basically any type of dancing,

51
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,520
if it's played to an Israeli song.

52
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,760
And that's pretty much what it is.

53
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,280
It started when the first settlers

54
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,240
came into Israel.

55
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,000
They built it in a Jewish country.

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,160
And they they took some

57
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,640
of the traditional dancing

58
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,120
that they brought from their own country,

59
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,800
like Russia and Poland.

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,880
And they implemented it

61
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,400
into a new type of Israeli folk dancing.

62
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,200
And it's really evolved over the years.

63
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,280
There's lots of different groups

64
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,480
in Israel right now.

65
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,960
And it's no longer constrained

66
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,880
to just the traditional thing.

67
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,520
It's now very modern dancing.

68
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,000
And that's why I'm saying

69
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,960
it's pretty much anything

70
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,960
that is played over an Israeli song

71
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,280
in the background.

72
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,320
So, when you're saying professionally,

73
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,040
like, what does that actually mean

74
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,120
to do this professionally?

75
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,920
It means that you have a choreographer

76
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,240
that built the dance.

77
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,560
And you have that group of people

78
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,720
that train a lot.

79
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,040
We train about twice

80
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,280
or three times a week

81
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,160
for two hours evey time.

82
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,440
We do ballet training and modern training.

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,560
And it's mainly in groups of two.

84
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,000
So, a man and a woman dancing together

85
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,960
through the same choreography.

86
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,160
With the whole costumes.

87
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,720
The whole shebang.

88
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,040
The whole shebang.

89
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,680
This is definitely something different

90
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,440
than what I imagined.

91
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,400
I'm thinking back to the 60s and 70s

92
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,120
videos of people

93
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,160
dancing together in large circles.

94
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,240
But I definitely have

95
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,200
to go check this out.

96
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,680
And this is actually a pretty nice segway

97
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,400
to something that

98
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
we chatted about earlier,

99
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
which is this whole notion

100
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,440
of the integration of performing arts

101
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,200
with business and with technology.

102
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,320
And you're running a startup, Hyro AI.

103
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,680
And we'll get to talk about

104
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,800
the NLP side of things.

105
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,240
But first, I want to talk about

106
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,280
this whole notion of performing arts

107
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,560
with business and startups.

108
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,480
Absolutely. I think that performing

109
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,440
takes a big role

110
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,160
in what I do professionally.

111
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,320
I think I associated the performance

112
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,080
with the professionalism

113
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,200
in the Israeli army.

114
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,960
That was the first time it occurred to me.

115
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,640
So, I was very fortunate to be in 8200,

116
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,080
like at many Israelis in the Tech World.

117
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,160
The Intelligence Corp technological unit.

118
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,400
And I was working on a project,

119
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,000
the cyber security project.

120
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,120
And that was very successful.

121
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,160
I don't know how to say it in English,

122
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,200
but in Hebrew we say, we scored it.

123
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,120
How do you translate it to English?

124
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,440
I think we're going to have to keep it

125
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,000
with scored it.

126
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay, great.

127
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,120
So, we scored it.

128
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,080
And then all the leaders

129
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,360
of the Israeli army and defense came in.

130
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,600
We had to present the project to them.

131
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,760
And that's the first time

132
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,560
where I was standing

133
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,640
in front of the chief of staff,

134
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,560
the Israeli army chief of staff.

135
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,640
And I felt like I'm taking everything

136
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,600
I learned from performing and dancing

137
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,400
to this world.

138
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,920
And it's really about

139
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,440
engaging your audience

140
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,600
and making them

141
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,560
pretty much adore you

142
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,480
and relate to what you're saying

143
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,240
and what you're doing.

144
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,000
And making sure

145
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,920
your messaging is accurate.

146
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,760
And I think it relates perfectly

147
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,920
to that world.

148
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,800
And then later on, it's in conferences.

149
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,640
The presenting at the booth.

150
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,760
It's even in company meetings,

151
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,560
and sales demos, obviously.

152
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,280
It's in every everything you do.

153
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,480
And you can see that

154
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,440
this is the stage I have right now

155
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,720
for my Zoom meeting.

156
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,680
I have to say that

157
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,880
I can not resonate more.

158
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,120
And we've recorded

159
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,760
almost 200 episodes of this show.

160
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,400
And I'm so happy

161
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
that we're talking about this.

162
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:13,920
This is something

163
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,400
that I have been reflecting lately.

164
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,960
But actually, by the time this comes up,

165
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,880
hopefully a book that I've been writing

166
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,320
will come out.

167
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,960
And a significant part of it

168
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,240
will have been about my experience

169
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,560
with my father taking me on stage

170
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,440
for a tech conference at 13 years old,

171
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,840
not knowing anything but learning slowly

172
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,880
the importance of being able

173
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
to deliver messages

174
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,320
in a coherent and concise way.

175
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,360
That's also engaging and then reflecting

176
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,240
on how important it is

177
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,080
when you're leading teams.

178
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,560
And I'm sure that

179
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,600
not only in public speaking,

180
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,280
but also when you're leading your team

181
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,960
with a startup,

182
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,200
and the way you're communicating

183
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,000
and engaging your employees

184
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and the people that are running

185
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
this adventure with you.

186
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,720
It's just as crucial.

187
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,920
Give me some insight into

188
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,400
what the specific things

189
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,320
that you've learned over the years

190
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,800
about expressing your opinions

191
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,040
and delivering messages

192
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,960
in not an entertaining way,

193
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,880
but an engaging way that makes people

194
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,920
want to listen to you

195
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,000
and like you said, adore you.

196
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,800
I think the secret is in preparing.

197
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,120
I always say that my superpower

198
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,400
is that I'm always prepared.

199
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,560
And I have to say

200
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,840
I was a bit nervous about this one

201
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,880
because there is no way to prepare.

202
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,440
Sorry, because

203
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,560
I didn't prepare you at all.

204
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,720
This is meant to be spontaneous.

205
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,120
But I already adore you

206
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,520
and I'm very very engaged.

207
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,400
So, you're doing a good job

208
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,810
with the performing arts already.

209
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,400
Stop it. No, I'm kidding.

210
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,960
So, I think preparing is the key here.

211
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,400
Making sure you know exactly

212
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,440
what you want to say,

213
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,800
how you want to say it.

214
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,000
Storytelling is also

215
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,560
very key in performance.

216
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,360
That you know

217
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,200
who you're talking to in advance.

218
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,240
I always like to prepare

219
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,920
like where the person is from,

220
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,520
what he cares about.

221
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,240
A good tip for sales

222
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,440
is to check their LinkedIn account

223
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,160
and see what they posted about.

224
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
So, what do they care about,

225
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,600
what are they passionate about,

226
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,000
and building a genuine conversation

227
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,280
around that.

228
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,760
Right. So, a lot of people say

229
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,480
that when you go on stage,

230
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,800
you want to start with the joke.

231
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,000
That always it loosens the audience.

232
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,120
But it sounds like what you're saying

233
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,520
when you're in sales

234
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,480
or when you're talking to somebody

235
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,680
in business is knowing something

236
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,640
that they're curious about.

237
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,680
And bringing that up

238
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,400
is just as important as jokes.

239
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,560
So, I'd love to talk a little bit

240
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,000
about now Hyro,

241
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,280
and what you're doing there.

242
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,960
And I'll bring back performing arts

243
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,640
for this conversation

244
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,160
just because I'm so excited

245
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,120
to talk about it finally.

246
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,960
But talk to me a little bit

247
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,760
about the startup that you're running now.

248
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,020
Absolutely.

249
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,200
So, I'm the chief operating officer at Hyro.

250
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,480
We're an innovative startup.

251
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,000
We're backed by top VCs.

252
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm here in the Bay Area,

253
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,400
I'm [--] by the way

254
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,960
In New York and in Tel Aviv.

255
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,400
So, all around.

256
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,800
And we're doing the next generation

257
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,680
of virtual assistance.

258
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,320
So, chatbots for website.

259
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,120
Voice assistance for call centers.

260
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,680
And we have this cutting edge approach

261
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,880
for natural language processing

262
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,640
or how are we able to understand

263
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,880
what the user is saying or asking.

264
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,280
So, virtual assistants,

265
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,600
but conversational AI.

266
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,240
Paint me the ecosystem.

267
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,040
It's getting to be pretty popular.

268
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,440
Almost any website that I go on

269
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,200
that is trying to sell me something,

270
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,320
it does so very successful

271
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,360
because I love engaging

272
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,720
with the virtual bots.

273
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,200
And the famous Turing test

274
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,040
of do you know that you're speaking

275
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,120
to a machine or a person.

276
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,920
It's becoming more and more relevant.

277
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,280
Talk to me about this ecosystem.

278
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,400
And then I'd love to talk more

279
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,640
about actually, the company.

280
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,760
Okay. Absolutely. So, conversational AI

281
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,080
is the set of technologies

282
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,040
that enables humans

283
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,560
to interact with technology, right?

284
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,800
So, things like Alexa, Google home,

285
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,280
Siri, all those great stuff,

286
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,480
and that includes chatbot.

287
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,120
So, if we focus on chatbot,

288
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,520
if you think about the chatbot experiences

289
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,120
that you had, it has two main categories.

290
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,760
So, you have the Dumb Bots,

291
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,080
those are the bots

292
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,640
that everything is pre-configured there.

293
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,120
So, it's all buttons and if and else.

294
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
And you have to think in advance

295
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,080
of all the possible questions

296
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,720
users can ask, and provide

297
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,160
all the possible answers in advance.

298
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,280
That's the world of Dumb Chatbots,

299
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,160
that's the most common ones.

300
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,520
Then if you do have an open text field,

301
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,960
which means that you allow users

302
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,520
to say whatever they want,

303
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,840
pretty much it means

304
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,840
that you have natural language

305
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,200
processing and understanding, right?

306
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,960
You have to be able

307
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,920
to break down the sentence,

308
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,840
understand what the user is asking about.

309
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,280
And that's where

310
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,200
natural language processing kicks in.

311
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,640
And then for that world,

312
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,240
we have that traditional approach.

313
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,440
It's fine to call it traditional

314
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,280
because it's a relatively new field anyway.

315
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,080
But that's what most solutions use.

316
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,280
They're all built on intents.

317
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,480
So, for example, when you say,

318
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,280
"Alexa, what's the weather like today?"

319
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,280
That's a weather query intent, right?

320
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,400
And a similar intent would be asking,

321
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,160
"How hot is it going to be today?"

322
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
or, "What's the temperature like

323
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,000
going to be today?"

324
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,480
and, "Should I wear a sweater today?"

325
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,800
It's all the same intent, right?

326
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,000
So, in order for the AI to identify

327
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,400
or recognize that intent,

328
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
you have to provide something

329
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,760
that's called training data.

330
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,520
So, you have to provide

331
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,040
all the similar phrasing

332
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,920
that I just mentioned,

333
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,120
in order for the AI

334
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,860
to understand this intent

335
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,560
and recognize it.

336
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,360
And it's a very long process.

337
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,760
It takes a lot of manual work.

338
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,160
It's called tagging similar conversations.

339
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,240
It's very expensive and it's limited

340
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,640
to the intent security support, right?

341
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,920
Not very scalable.

342
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,880
So, what we do at Hyro,

343
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,920
we have this whole new approach

344
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,880
for conversational Ai,

345
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,360
which I'm super excited about.

346
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,920
Instead of moduling intent,

347
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,800
we module the language itself.

348
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,160
So, we use computational linguistics

349
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,000
and we learn

350
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,480
all the different language roles.

351
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,640
Like how to identify

352
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,720
the verb in a sentence.

353
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,040
Or how to identify the nouns

354
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,920
in the sentence.

355
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Which means that we understand

356
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,520
in real time

357
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,800
what the user is asking.

358
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,680
And so, we're able to get

359
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,560
a very high quality

360
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,400
of conversation super fast.

361
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,440
It sounds to me like what you're doing

362
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,760
is literally, it's also almost like

363
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,520
third and fourth grade grammar classes.

364
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,760
When kids have to learn,

365
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,800
they're not just learning the intent,

366
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,760
they're learning about

367
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,920
how are sentences formed.

368
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,640
Because when you read a sentence,

369
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,400
only by knowing

370
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,320
the formation of the sentence,

371
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,480
sometimes you can really understand

372
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
what the person means.

373
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,680
Sometimes when you just add

374
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,560
a comma somewhere,

375
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,720
you're changing the whole intent

376
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,520
of the sentence.

377
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,900
The famous example I would say

378
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,400
from Hamilton I believe, with Angelica.

379
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,520
Where there's a whole song

380
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,280
about there was a misplaced comma

381
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,520
and it changes the whole meaning

382
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,280
of the sentence, right?

383
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,720
Yes, and Peggy. Don't forget Peggy.

384
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,200
The most important, of course.

385
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,280
I want also I want to talk about

386
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,440
scalable processes.

387
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,480
And one thing that you mentioned earlier

388
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,640
is this idea of running scalable processes

389
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,360
and Scrum Master Agile.

390
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,200
So, you're the chief operating officer.

391
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,160
First of all, give me two sentence brief,

392
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,560
what is the chief operating officer

393
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,080
in your eyes?

394
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,840
So, it varies tremendously

395
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,560
between different organizations.

396
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,600
For us specifically,

397
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,440
I'm overseeing all the commercial aspects

398
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,840
of the company.

399
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,560
So, sales, business development,

400
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,440
partnerships, all of those.

401
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,960
Product market fit and so on.

402
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,160
It can mean different things

403
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,000
for different organizations.

404
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,160
Sometimes it means managing legal

405
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,560
and HR and things like that.

406
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,480
That's what I'm doing for Hyro.

407
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,360
What is the second person question?

408
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,640
Well, specifically, being a scrum master

409
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,920
and running Agile and JIRA,

410
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,520
you've done this in several organizations.

411
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,400
It's something that it sounds like

412
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,240
you're at least

413
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,080
a little bit passionate about.

414
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,760
And I'd love to learn a little bit more

415
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,400
about running scalable processes.

416
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,240
I'm super passionate

417
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,040
about building scalable processes.

418
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,920
I'm a JIRA geek, I would say.

419
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
I have actually been called

420
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,760
the JIRA queen

421
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,920
in every organization that I went to.

422
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,560
Because I like to roll up my sleeves

423
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,120
and actually configure JIRA. Configure.

424
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,960
I even wrote a paper for the university

425
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,800
about the Agile development lifecycle.

426
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,320
And I'll tell you why.

427
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,960
I think that once you sit down

428
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,720
to configure a workflow,

429
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,360
it really enforces you to think

430
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,160
about the process

431
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,320
and enforce different steps

432
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,600
in the process.

433
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,320
For example, when you have to define

434
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,120
all the status you have in the workflow,

435
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,680
so now it makes you think.

436
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,520
Does every task

437
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,800
need to go through testing, for example.

438
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,760
If you decide yes,

439
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,160
then you build a status called testing

440
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,640
and that's it.

441
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,120
From now until forever, every test

442
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,680
will have to go through testing.

443
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,160
And that's an amazing way

444
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,800
to enforce processes

445
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,160
across in the organization

446
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,560
in a very scalable way

447
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,520
with very little effort.

448
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,960
Right. Right.

449
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,920
A selfish question.

450
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,720
because I've been in this heated debate

451
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,840
for many years

452
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,640
since my time in the 8200 unit.

453
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,760
Task story points.

454
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,000
For whoever doesn't know,

455
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,760
Oh, I see that

456
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,840
we're going to enter a debate here.

457
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,200
The notion is, for anybody

458
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,680
who doesn't understand JIRA

459
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,720
or Scrum in general, the idea here is that

460
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,800
you are assigning tasks.

461
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,360
And while in day to day we ask each other

462
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
how long is the task going to take you,

463
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,000
in JIRA you assign story points to a task

464
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,600
based on complexity.

465
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,040
Now some choose to continue

466
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,560
working through time.

467
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,840
Others choose to work through complexity.

468
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,040
They have their pros and cons.

469
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,880
But MIchael, I'd love for you

470
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,360
to explain to me a little bit about

471
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,680
the pros and cons of each.

472
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,960
Because in every organization

473
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,840
that I've been a part of,

474
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,040
I've seen the good, the bad

475
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,760
and the ugly of both approaches.

476
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,320
And it just seems like there still

477
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,360
is no convergence on one perfect approach.

478
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,880
That's an amazing question.

479
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,000
I personally have a love hate relationship

480
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,040
with story points.

481
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,760
Because on the one hand,

482
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,760
it's psychologically for people,

483
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,440
it's much easier to give story points

484
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,000
instead of saying

485
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,600
it's going to take me four hours.

486
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,920
So, usually you define

487
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,040
what is the story point

488
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,600
for the people

489
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,880
who are not familiar with this,

490
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,000
you just say what's the time unit

491
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,480
that each story point is equal to.

492
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,600
So, when you're giving story point,

493
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,680
when you're giving your estimation

494
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,280
in story point,

495
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,920
you are really giving

496
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,720
your time estimation.

497
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,480
But people, they're having

498
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,200
a much easier time saying it

499
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,560
in story points instead of hours.

500
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,080
So, I do like that aspect

501
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,320
of making it easier for people

502
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
to adapt this approach.

503
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,240
Because one of the most difficult things

504
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,640
of moving into

505
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,440
an Agile development lifecycle

506
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,120
is the adaption.

507
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,840
So, engineers tend to hate that.

508
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,240
So, this is the one thing

509
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,800
that can make it easier.

510
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,080
And I do have to say it,

511
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,680
that I personally don't like it,

512
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,200
because why not just say how much time

513
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,920
it's going to take you.

514
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,640
But because I'm very practical,

515
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,120
but I do like it

516
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,840
because JIRA has a built-in tool

517
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,240
to measure velocity through it.

518
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,320
So, if you do use story points,

519
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,800
you can very easily measure

520
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,360
how many tasks you can do

521
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,760
in a sprint.

522
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,920
Sprint is the interval of a week

523
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,000
or two or three

524
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,800
that the team is working in.

525
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,080
If you're doing scrum,

526
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,360
we can go into a Canva also

527
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,840
if you want.

528
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,600
But I don't know how deep you want to go

529
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,800
into the world of Agile.

530
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,760
It's love hate relationship,

531
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,000
but definitely I recommend estimations

532
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,680
and choosing one path and going with it.

533
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,840
Wonderful. So, consistency, at the end

534
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,240
that's the main key, right?

535
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,720
So, there's pros and cons of each,

536
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,680
but with consistency is the key.

537
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,960
And so, when you're entering

538
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,320
these organizations,

539
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,160
what tangibly do you do with JIRA?

540
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,520
Why are you considered the JIRA queen

541
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,240
of these organizations?

542
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,440
Because I enforce the entire organization

543
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,320
to move to JIRA.

544
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,440
And then when they don't do it,

545
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,920
I do it myself and I configure it myself.

546
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,360
So, on the first company I've been with

547
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,920
after the Army, they're called MCE,

548
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,000
Mobile Care Experts.

549
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,800
They're selling into the telecom space.

550
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,320
So, we got to a place where

551
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,760
we were 70 people in the R&D,

552
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,680
or 70 developers.

553
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,480
And we were managing everything.

554
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:10,960
Every team

555
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,800
was managing their tasks differently

556
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,120
and we implemented the waterfall.

557
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,000
Waterfall is a very old methodology.

558
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,320
Where like a waterfall,

559
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,920
you have different steps in the process.

560
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,800
So, for example, you have design

561
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,600
and then design review,

562
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,960
and then development,

563
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,960
and then testing and then another review.

564
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,960
And it's usually a very long process.

565
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,200
It's a very good way

566
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,440
to manage things at scale

567
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,960
because it's very determined.

568
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,320
But it means that you have

569
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,840
a very long development lifecycle.

570
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,920
Because if you have all these steps

571
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,800
in the process,

572
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,040
the process takes a long time.

573
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,520
So, it's usually like a release cycle

574
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,600
of even six months

575
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,960
to release a new version.

576
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,920
So, we took the 70 people R&D

577
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,960
and we move them from waterfall,

578
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,120
to Scrum, to two-week Sprints.

579
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,960
We started with two weeks.

580
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,120
We ended up after six months,

581
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,640
moving to one week sprint.

582
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,680
Which is amazing in my eyes.

583
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,760
Really.

584
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,200
And I did it back then

585
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,360
as I was the VP of Project Management.

586
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,240
That was part of my role to do that.

587
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,840
Internal processes as well as

588
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,080
the external customer facing processes,

589
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,320
that was my main responsibility.

590
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,200
So we did it very organized.

591
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,880
We took an external company

592
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,400
that helped us educate people

593
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,320
on what is Scrum

594
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,560
and how does a Sprint work

595
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,200
and all the key terms,

596
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,320
which taught me a lot.

597
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,600
And then I was able to do the same

598
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
for the other two companies

599
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,160
I've been with.

600
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,400
Wonderful. Wonderful.

601
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,040
That's just incredible.

602
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,760
The difference, at what point

603
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,240
of a startup's life cycle

604
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,920
is it really relevant, do you think,

605
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,680
to start adapting this methodology?

606
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,360
And not just Agile.

607
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,800
Because obviously, I think

608
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,640
the earlier the startup,

609
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,640
the more crucial it is to be agile

610
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,000
and be open to pivoting

611
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,320
and for quick feedback.

612
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,360
But in terms of the tangibly

613
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,560
of operating it

614
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,200
through a software like JIRA or any other,

615
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,400
is it from day one?

616
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,440
Is it from employee number 30?

617
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,400
Is there some rule of thumb

618
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
that you're starting to understand

619
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,240
as you were going through

620
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,200
these different organizations?

621
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,880
Absolutely.

622
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,040
As soon as something falls

623
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,720
between the cracks.

624
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,080
As soon as what you currently

625
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,640
have in place is not good enough,

626
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,760
and if tasks are not being done on time,

627
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,880
or if someone has to keep

628
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,000
following up with everyone

629
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,400
to make sure they're being done,

630
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,960
that's when you need to scale it.

631
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,100
That's when you need to scale it. Okay.

632
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,680
So, Michael, 20 minutes are almost over.

633
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,240
But I want to go back a little bit

634
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,080
to performing arts.

635
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,040
Just as a segway into who you are

636
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,000
and what you're passionate about.

637
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,160
You've taken on a variety of roles.

638
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,640
You were talking about performing arts,

639
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,920
to Scrum methodology, to processes,

640
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,760
to conversational AI.

641
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,320
What are you really passionate about?

642
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,360
How do you choose what you spend

643
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,240
your valuable hours of the day doing?

644
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,440
I think I would define it

645
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,320
as I'm passionate about technology.

646
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,600
So, startups that are working

647
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,120
on cutting edge technology

648
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,280
and also, making customers happy.

649
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,360
So, if its the technology that involves

650
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,000
a lot of work closely with customers.

651
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,480
I like to work

652
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,960
with big organizations or enterprises

653
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,760
and build a genuine relationship

654
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,160
that are for the long term,

655
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,000
not just a very short project.

656
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,480
So, continuous work

657
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,320
and showing value over time.

658
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,840
That's what I'm really passionate about.

659
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,000
And scaling internal processes.

660
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,560
I love it. Okay. And before we leave,

661
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,520
I need three words that you would choose

662
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,560
to describe yourself,

663
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,760
or that your co-founders

664
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,560
would choose to describe you.

665
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,700
Okay, great. So, I watch a bunch

666
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,080
of your episodes,

667
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,760
so, I was ready with this question.

668
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,560
I have to say the exercise of deciding

669
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,760
on three words is awesome

670
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,400
and I recommend it to everyone.

671
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,640
So, the first word is problematic

672
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,560
because it's in Hebrew.

673
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,400
Because I couldn't find

674
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,880
a good parallel in English.

675
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,120
So, I'll explain what it means.

676
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,680
It's a bulldozer, okay.

677
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,080
That's what it is in Hebrew.

678
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,240
In English it means,

679
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,800
the literal meaning is a truck

680
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,960
that breaks stones.

681
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,920
And it's a word that's commonly used

682
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,520
to describe people who make things happen.

683
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,240
So, that's my first word.

684
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,880
And then the second and third

685
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,840
is obsessive and passionate.

686
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,440
Bulldozer, obsessive and passionate.

687
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,480
I have to say, that bulldozer

688
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,040
might be my favorite word

689
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,720
out of almost 200 episodes,

690
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,640
I guess that's 600 words.

691
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,080
It's just wonderful.

692
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,240
Michael, this was wonderful.

693
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,040
This was insightful.

694
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Thank you for the time.

695
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,040
I know how busy you are.

696
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,040
And mazel tov on your birthday,

697
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,360
which is just recently right?

698
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,760
And mazel tov in your book.

699
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,560
Thank you. Thank you.

700
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,760
Hopefully by the time this airs,

701
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,400
it'll be out.

702
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
We're doing the final touches.

703
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,040
At least now I know how hard it is.

704
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,440
But this was just

705
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,400
a wonderful conversation.

706
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,760
So, toda raba.

707
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:55,640
Thank you. This is super fun.
