1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,400
It is really valuable to have someone who

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,760
has direct contact

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,720
with the customers also involved

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,000
in building the product.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,600
And so, that's kind of

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,360
what led me to be

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,160
in a more technical role

8
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,440
and to eventually have

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,940
a team of engineers on my own.

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,720
Jennifer Richard, thank you so much

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,280
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,720
How are you?

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,120
Doing well, thank you

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,280
and thanks for having me.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,560
Thank you very much for being here.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,320
You started off

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,240
being an English major,

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,440
somehow you find your way

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,000
into tech, but not just tech,

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,840
you going across being

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,520
a founding member

22
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,320
of a few different ventures.

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,440
Venture back ventures

24
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,720
and then a climbing into the VC space

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,880
at the second fund,

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,160
I believe that you're at now.

27
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,080
And now you're a principal

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,560
at Bonfire Ventures,

29
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,880
leading a seed stage rounds.

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,018
Tell me a little bit

31
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:20,040
about your background

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,720
and how do you transition

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,240
from English Major,

34
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,280
to doing what you're doing today?

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,840
Yeah. So, I think a lot of it

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,880
was just some opportunistic moves

37
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,360
and a little bit of luck,

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,680
but I have always enjoyed writing.

39
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,200
When I went to college,

40
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,640
I knew that I wanted to pursue English

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,880
and was thinking about

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,680
maybe going into law.

43
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,000
After that,

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,960
I quickly realized after taking

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,600
a couple of law classes that

46
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,320
that wasn't what I wanted to do.

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,040
And I ended up graduating

48
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,200
and just not having any idea.

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,080
And it was also during

50
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,600
the last financial crash.

51
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,760
So, not a lot of opportunities

52
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
in terms of jobs.

53
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,840
So, I ended up moving into entertainment.

54
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,040
Working at CAA,

55
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,520
which is one of the world's

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,400
biggest talent agencies.

57
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,240
I was there for about three years,

58
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,600
went through the training program there.

59
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,960
And in that time we represented people

60
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,800
like Eric Reese, Gary Vaynerchuk

61
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,240
and several other

62
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,120
just huge entrepreneurs.

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,640
And what they were doing seemed

64
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,400
a lot more interesting than

65
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
what I was doing.

66
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
And I saw there was

67
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,400
a blossoming tech ecosystem

68
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,640
happening in LA.

69
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,920
And so, I decided to take the leap,

70
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,200
joined the startup,

71
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,960
just scaling customer support, at first.

72
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,000
After a couple of months,

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,520
that company was acquired.

74
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,920
And I got to move into

75
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,680
a more technical role

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,240
at the founders next pivot.

77
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,320
And so, from there,

78
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,560
that's kind of what started

79
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,000
just my career in tech.

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,720
Building companies, selling them,

81
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,520
building and eventually

82
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,480
I decided that what the

83
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,880
our investors were doing

84
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,560
also seemed really interesting,

85
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,120
and went to school

86
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,920
to ultimately move into VC

87
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,280
and that's how I made my way

88
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,280
where I am right now.

89
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,640
Right. So, you're doing

90
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,920
your MBA in Berkeley

91
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,040
with the hope to make it

92
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,080
into the VC space.

93
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,560
What was it about the VC space

94
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,440
that really resonated with you

95
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,040
that you felt compelling

96
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,960
for you to go and work there?

97
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,760
Yeah. So, I think

98
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,920
there were a couple of things.

99
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,120
The biggest one was that,

100
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:39,040
I worked at a couple

101
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,280
of different startups

102
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,200
and like most startups,

103
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,280
there were some issues

104
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
with our culture

105
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,840
and, you know, issues with diversity.

106
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,520
And I realized how hard it is

107
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,280
to make the change from within,

108
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,840
within the company.

109
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,080
It really was,

110
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
our investors who had the most power

111
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,400
and the people

112
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,280
who are deploying the capital

113
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,240
who have the most influence on

114
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,400
what the ecosystem looks like, literally.

115
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,760
And so, I think that was

116
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,760
my biggest motivating factor

117
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,280
to get into VC

118
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,200
was to be able to influence

119
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,840
who's getting money,

120
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,440
what kind of responsibilities they have,

121
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,320
holding founders accountable,

122
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,280
and also just being able

123
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,160
to support this ecosystem I love,

124
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,440
without being in siloed

125
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,560
into one company

126
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,480
and always working

127
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,240
on one specific problem.

128
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,760
And so, I think that

129
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,880
the blend of those two things

130
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,440
is what makes VC a perfect fit for me.

131
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,000
And ever since I moved in

132
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,280
a few years ago, I just love it.

133
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,200
I love that.

134
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,440
So, take me back a little bit

135
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,120
to this transition in your career.

136
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,520
Growing up,

137
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,880
did you imagine that you'll go into tech

138
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,560
that you'll be

139
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,320
an investor at a VC Fund,

140
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,280
especially this young?

141
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,200
No, absolutely not.

142
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,680
I didn't even know

143
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,640
what tacking a VC was

144
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,880
when I was growing up.

145
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,760
I'm first generation college,

146
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,120
and just a lot of the things

147
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
that I'm doing now,

148
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,771
I just had no exposure to

149
00:05:21,772 --> 00:05:22,960
when I was a kid.

150
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,720
And so, when I was growing up,

151
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,520
the things I thought of were

152
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,800
the very traditional doctor, lawyer,

153
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,560
those kinds of career paths,

154
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,640
I just didn't even know

155
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,360
that this one was an option.

156
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,320
Wow.

157
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,980
And what really was it that made that?

158
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:42,520
So, you mentioned that

159
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,280
you were part of a company

160
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,400
that got acquired that

161
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,160
and then you transitioned

162
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,760
into a more techie role.

163
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
But it sounds like

164
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,200
there's a little bit more meed there

165
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,120
in terms of, you know,

166
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,280
the thought process

167
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,920
of making that transition.

168
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,080
What was that like

169
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
and what were some of the things

170
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,840
that perhaps either surprised you

171
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,560
or disappointed you in that transition?

172
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,200
Yeah, I mean,

173
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,640
when I was a kid,

174
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,640
so probably in elementary school,

175
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,360
middle school,

176
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,400
I taught myself how to code.

177
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,400
And so, that is definitely

178
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,440
what influenced me

179
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,280
to get into a more technical role

180
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,200
while I was in startups.

181
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,440
And you know, I think,

182
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,320
so, I was running customer support

183
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,840
at this first company,

184
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,040
at this first startup I was at.

185
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,240
And what was so interesting to me

186
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,520
was that we were getting

187
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,920
in so many different valuable pieces

188
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,160
of insight from our customers,

189
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,120
but there wasn't really

190
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,120
a established communication channel

191
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,880
between support and the engineers

192
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,560
who were building out our product.

193
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,760
And so, I was constantly,

194
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,160
you know, pinging the engineers

195
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,880
telling them we've gotten

196
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,560
this feedback from our customers.

197
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,480
I think we should make

198
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,440
this change on the site.

199
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,920
And at first, I got some pushback,

200
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,480
as I think support managers often do.

201
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,040
Excuse me.

202
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,080
But, eventually, our CTO

203
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,560
and our engineering team realized

204
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,400
this is affecting our bottom line.

205
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:26,720
And so, it is really valuable

206
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
to have someone

207
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,000
who has direct contact

208
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
with the customers also involved

209
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,280
in building the product.

210
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,840
And so, that's kind of

211
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,640
what led me to be

212
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,400
in a more technical role

213
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,000
and to eventually have a team

214
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,640
of engineers on my own.

215
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,200
Unbelievable.

216
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,240
And what were some

217
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,720
of the most exciting things

218
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,520
about being a founding member

219
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,440
of a few venture backed companies?

220
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,480
What were some of the highlights,

221
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,720
perhaps for people that aren't from tech

222
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,000
or aren't from the VC team,

223
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,200
that they're curious to hear about

224
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,400
that founding member experience?

225
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,240
Yeah. I mean,

226
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:10,320
I think that the biggest is,

227
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,760
you know, starting

228
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,640
from absolutely nothing

229
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,840
and just having this idea of a product

230
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,480
and then launching our MVP

231
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,440
and just knowing that

232
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,920
it could be so much better

233
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,680
but just having

234
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,920
a super crappy product.

235
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,400
And then just being able

236
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,720
to constantly see this evolution

237
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,880
and being in rooms where

238
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,240
you can take one path or another

239
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,280
and weighing out the pros and cons

240
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,440
and then executing on these different,

241
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,080
you know, on these different decisions,

242
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,160
and just seeing the way

243
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,920
that it impacts the company.

244
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,600
I think that, of course,

245
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,000
the biggest you know,

246
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,360
the most memorable moment

247
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,520
was finding out

248
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,400
that we were being acquired

249
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,960
and just seeing, you know,

250
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,360
years of work turn into something big.

251
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,760
And so, I think that there's so many

252
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,440
highs and lows in building

253
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,520
a company and it requires

254
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,480
so much teamwork and camaraderie.

255
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,240
And the people

256
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,040
that I worked with

257
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,200
at those startups are still some

258
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,600
of my closest friends.

259
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,720
And so, just being in the trenches

260
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,760
with a team of people

261
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,960
and having a singular vision

262
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,200
and getting it done,

263
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,840
it was just incredible.

264
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,440
Right.

265
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,480
Which aspects

266
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,200
of the entrepreneurial experience

267
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,680
do you take with you

268
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,640
in your role as principal at VC funds?

269
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,760
Yeah. So, I think it's really interesting

270
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,280
that VC funds are very small, typically.

271
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,880
And so, there is a very similar feeling

272
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,880
of wearing several different hats, like,

273
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,320
for instance, at Bonfire,

274
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,680
I'm sourcing investments,

275
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,280
I'm doing diligence,

276
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,720
but also doing marketing for the firm

277
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,040
and helping with strategy.

278
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,120
And so, there is no responsibility

279
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,800
that's too big or too small.

280
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,120
And that's very similar to the mentality

281
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,280
you have to have working in a startup

282
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,680
or starting an early stage company.

283
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,600
Because I can empathize

284
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,440
with our founders very much,

285
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
because it's a lot of us

286
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,280
just doing everything

287
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,240
and trying to pull things together

288
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,320
to make this thing work.

289
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,440
And, you know,

290
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,720
we have a similar feeling of grittiness.

291
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,480
And yeah,

292
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,880
I mean, I guess that's kind of my answer.

293
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,440
So, tell me a little bit about

294
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,200
your perspective in the VC space.

295
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,480
Whether it's sourcing deals

296
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,040
or doing due diligence,

297
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,920
what are some of the things

298
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,000
that you're particularly looking for

299
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,080
as either you're looking

300
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,960
for an interesting company

301
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,600
to source and to communicate with

302
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,760
or in the due diligence process

303
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,960
as a possible investment opportunity?

304
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,360
Yeah. So, I think that question

305
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,760
is two fold, because

306
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,200
I'm always looking for

307
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,600
the right company

308
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,240
and product market fit

309
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,520
and growing market.

310
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,920
So, the right opportunity

311
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,720
from the company perspective

312
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
and the product perspective

313
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,240
as well as the right teams to support.

314
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,640
And I think that the teams

315
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,280
are really important.

316
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,000
Because going back to

317
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,920
what I said previously about

318
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,200
having this responsibility

319
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,880
to impact culture and the landscape

320
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,320
and who's getting capital,

321
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,720
I want to invest in good people.

322
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,920
In people who are strong leaders

323
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,640
and who want

324
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,120
to empower their teams

325
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,680
and have diverse companies.

326
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,040
And so, I think that's one.

327
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,640
And then on the other side,

328
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,960
I want to invest in products

329
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,160
that are going to change the world.

330
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,720
If I would have been in VC,

331
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,280
back when the investors

332
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,400
were writing texts

333
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,760
in to Uber seed round

334
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,520
or Airbnb and just being able

335
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,600
to invest in companies

336
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,040
that fundamentally change

337
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,000
the way that people work and operate,

338
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,840
it is always the ultimate goal.

339
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,480
And so, any type of company

340
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,440
that is impacting a large growing market

341
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,320
and is providing a software solution

342
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,480
to help people work more efficiently,

343
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,400
live more efficiently, that's something

344
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,640
I'm really interested in.

345
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,400
Right.

346
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,200
Do you feel there's enough fair access

347
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,600
for people that don't come

348
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,400
from the tech world

349
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,040
into the tech world?

350
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,600
And I'm asking this because,

351
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,680
you know, it seems that,

352
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,760
especially 2020 is showing us

353
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,040
that diversity inclusion is

354
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,280
still an issue everywhere in the world,

355
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,320
also in the US.

356
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
And one of the things

357
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,480
that I've been thinking about

358
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,520
is the opportunities

359
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,480
that are presented

360
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,200
and breaking this cycles.

361
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,920
And you're mentioning that

362
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,720
you're a first generation college student

363
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,600
and you didn't even think

364
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,000
about going into tech,

365
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,520
let alone be a VC.

366
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,080
And one of the things

367
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,240
that have been curious

368
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,680
and challenging my thought process

369
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,800
with is, what are some things

370
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,960
that really should happen in order

371
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,200
for this industry

372
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,680
to become more accessible?

373
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,880
Whether it's through training

374
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,760
or through job opportunities

375
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,800
or entry positions,

376
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,080
to get people into the right,

377
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,720
into the hooks.

378
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,320
Because you mentioned

379
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,920
that one of the things

380
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,080
that got you in there

381
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,200
was a position

382
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,920
that you transferred to,

383
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,000
once you were already

384
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,720
sort of half a leg into this.

385
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,000
So, I'd love to hear your perspective.

386
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,400
And what do you think

387
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,240
we could improve on

388
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,000
or we could do?

389
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,080
Yeah. So, I mean,

390
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,680
I think that there's several angles

391
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,560
with which we have

392
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,200
to tackle this problem.

393
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,600
I mean, a big one

394
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,400
is having more diverse tech writers,

395
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,320
which is a big topic

396
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,600
of conversation right now.

397
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,880
Another one is increasing

398
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,000
the access to STEM programs

399
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,520
in schools

400
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,640
that house minority students,

401
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,920
which tend to be completely underfunded.

402
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,640
But I think that

403
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,600
the biggest issue right now

404
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,640
is that once

405
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,000
these underrepresented founders,

406
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,280
investors, et cetera,

407
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,120
actually get into a VC fund

408
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,160
or get into a startup,

409
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,120
those environments aren't inclusive.

410
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,440
And so many of them end up leaving

411
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,800
and taking a different career path.

412
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,040
And so, I think that

413
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,040
so much of this needs to happen

414
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,440
at the personal level

415
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,680
for leaders of these funds

416
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,320
and companies to do

417
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
the personal work

418
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,760
of understanding empathy,

419
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,200
understanding what it means

420
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,320
to have an inclusive culture.

421
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,400
And that work is really tough.

422
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,960
And a lot of people are afraid of it.

423
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,360
A lot of people avoid it.

424
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,001
But I think,

425
00:14:58,002 --> 00:15:00,040
that's what needs to happen for us

426
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,760
to turn the needle,

427
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,400
move the needle.

428
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,880
So, how do you break

429
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,520
that cycle then?

430
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,760
Because you're mentioning a lot

431
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,640
of people are afraid of it,

432
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,040
a lot of people

433
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,120
don't even know where to start.

434
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,200
It's a taboo subject

435
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,560
in a lot of people's minds.

436
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,280
And, you know,

437
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,480
it's like a chicken and the egg.

438
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,240
You need to have diversity

439
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,920
in order for it to become less

440
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,880
of a taboo subject.

441
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,400
But you don't have the diversity

442
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,880
because it is a taboo subject.

443
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,760
So, how do you think

444
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,480
we can potentially start moving

445
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,560
the needle in the right direction?

446
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,040
Perhaps it's just a generational thing .

447
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
And the new generation

448
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,360
of perhaps entrepreneurs

449
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,720
are growing up in a more diverse world.

450
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,880
But what do you think

451
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,480
could happen already right now,

452
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,680
as somebody who's leading investments,

453
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,240
who's helping promote certain companies,

454
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,320
what do you think should happen?

455
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,280
Yeah. I mean, I think that

456
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,080
I'm seeing a lot

457
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,040
a huge surge in companies

458
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,320
that are hiring consultants,

459
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,360
for instance, to do, you know,

460
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,920
the introspective work

461
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,440
with companies and teams.

462
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,120
I think that there needs to be

463
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
more coaching for executives.

464
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,360
And I think that

465
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,000
so much of it needs to start

466
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,760
at the executive level individually

467
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,840
so that people can ask

468
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,480
the questions that they're afraid

469
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,000
to ask in front of a group of people.

470
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And, you know,

471
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,640
they can get down

472
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,960
to the deeper issues of leadership

473
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,800
without bringing the whole company in.

474
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,200
And then I do think

475
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,720
that this needs to be

476
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,120
an exercise across companies.

477
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,960
And I think there is a feeling that,

478
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,960
you know, diversity is a political issue

479
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,760
or that these types of talks

480
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,640
don't belong in the workplace.

481
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,000
And until we get over that,

482
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,560
we're never going to be able

483
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,440
to talk about it.

484
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,760
And so, I think

485
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,560
that people need to work

486
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,320
on themselves,

487
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,560
on an individual level,

488
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,600
and then be willing

489
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,440
and courageous enough

490
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,600
to have these talks as a team.

491
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,960
I love that.

492
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,840
Thank you for sharing, Jennifer.

493
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,920
What does it mean to be a connoisseur

494
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,320
of a natural and biodynamic wines?

495
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,280
What is that?

496
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,120
And how do you even get that

497
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,000
as a passion?

498
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,840
Yeah, so I actually

499
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,480
started drinking natural wines

500
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,560
with my friends maybe about

501
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,400
a year ago and that has definitely--

502
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,040
What's a natural one?

503
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,160
Am I not drinking natural wine?

504
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,560
I don't know.

505
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,920
Probably not, though.

506
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,901
So, natural in biodynamic wines,

507
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:44,320
they're wines that are

508
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:46,720
created through processes

509
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,040
of very minimal intervention.

510
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,400
And so they're typically used

511
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,120
with organic grapes.

512
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,960
But organic and natural wines

513
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,800
are not the same.

514
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,640
It's more about

515
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,040
the prospect of minimal sulfites,

516
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,560
just minimal chemicals,

517
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,360
minimal intervention at all

518
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,840
in making them.

519
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,080
And they're very good.

520
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,920
For many people,

521
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,240
it's an acquired taste,

522
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,560
but it's just a cleaner drink.

523
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,560
You're not hung over the next day

524
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,640
and they're really delicious

525
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,680
and tend to be coming

526
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,680
from small local farmers,

527
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,760
much more sustainable

528
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,880
farming in general,

529
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,800
and so, better for the

530
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
environment as well.

531
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,640
Wow. That's wonderful.

532
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,600
And so, what is actually happening

533
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,800
with the wine market today

534
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,400
and why is this not a common thing?

535
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,680
Is it mainly pricing,

536
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,560
mainly the market?

537
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,560
So, I think it's actually becoming

538
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,200
more and more common.

539
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,320
and if you look in your city,

540
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,760
you will probably find

541
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,800
several natural wine makers.

542
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,520
I think that, or,

543
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,920
several shops that carry natural wines,

544
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,280
I think the biggest thing is that

545
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,960
the traditional wine makers are,

546
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,360
so, they're the incumbents.

547
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,320
It's kind of like in tech

548
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,480
and they have all

549
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,960
the money and all the power

550
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,520
and they're seeing the uprise

551
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,160
of this new natural wine movement.

552
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,920
And I am against it

553
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,000
and typically trying to cross it.

554
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,800
And so, I think that it's just a matter

555
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,000
of the smaller growers,

556
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,560
the smaller shops,

557
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,040
doing more marketing and figuring out

558
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,840
a way to convince people

559
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,600
that what they've been doing

560
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,040
for all of this time

561
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,800
is not necessarily the best.

562
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,000
And there's an alternative

563
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,840
that they can get

564
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,760
for a slightly higher price point.

565
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,600
It is a little bit more expensive

566
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,400
depending on what you're drinking.

567
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,560
100%.

568
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,840
That's very very interesting.

569
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,520
And I'm going to have

570
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,600
to check it out a little bit more,

571
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,200
because I had no idea that

572
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,480
this is even in market.

573
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,960
Or that I'm not drinking an actual one.

574
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,360
I thought that

575
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,160
when I was drinking wine,

576
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
I was drinking something very natural

577
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,800
and I feel almost cheated right now.

578
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,840
So, I'm going to have to work

579
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,600
that with myself later.

580
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
But, Jennifer, before we leave,

581
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,560
I have to ask you also

582
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,280
about your passion for e-commerce.

583
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,600
Because we didn't get

584
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,360
to talk about that yet.

585
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,400
But that is something

586
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,760
that you've been deeply involved

587
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,960
with the different companies.

588
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,520
And you mentioned that

589
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,280
it's a personal interest of yours.

590
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,280
Give me a little bit of a brief

591
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,160
about e-commerce

592
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,160
and why that is something

593
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,160
that you're so excited about?

594
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,680
Yeah. So, I think it starts with

595
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,360
my experience working in startups.

596
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,200
So, the companies that I was at,

597
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,880
one of them was

598
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,240
pure-play D2C e-commerce,

599
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,200
and then the other two

600
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,560
were ad tech or crowd funding

601
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,320
but had an e commerce element.

602
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,600
And so, all of my professional tech career

603
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
has been in e commerce

604
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,680
through some form.

605
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,160
And at the most recent company,

606
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,480
Pop & Suki,

607
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,880
I was actually employee number two.

608
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,640
Built e commerce from the ground up,

609
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,880
from literally nothing.

610
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,880
And so, I just understand

611
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,560
that pain point so deeply

612
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,200
of internationalization

613
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,520
or logistics and drop shipping,

614
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,320
conversion and mobile commerce,

615
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,520
and trying to optimize.

616
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,760
And so, it's just something

617
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,240
that I know a lot about.

618
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,200
And I think as an investor,

619
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,960
you tend to gravitate towards

620
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,360
problems and solutions

621
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,480
that you understand.

622
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,160
Because at the end of the day,

623
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,200
you're taking a bet

624
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,320
and you want to take a bet

625
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,560
with on companies for which you have

626
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,800
the most possible

627
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,520
context and information.

628
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,320
And so, that is definitely why I gravitate.

629
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,840
And also as a consumer,

630
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,600
I love online shopping.

631
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,360
I'm constantly

632
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,480
on different e-commerce websites,

633
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,120
stopping checking them out,

634
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,480
seeing what platform they're using,

635
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,680
how their site set up.

636
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,840
And so, it's just a natural passion

637
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,960
at the end of the day.

638
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,880
That's very interesting.

639
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,640
Thank you, Jennifer.

640
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,840
Before we leave, I want to thank you

641
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,360
for being generous with your time.

642
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,400
This was really, really great.

643
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,760
And I love hearing about your journey,

644
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,400
your interests,

645
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,160
your take on how we can improve

646
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,000
the tech scene today

647
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,400
in the industry as a whole.

648
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,200
And then lastly, discovering

649
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,600
that I've been cheated on

650
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,000
with my wine drinking.

651
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,120
So, thank you for that.

652
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,400
But Jennifer, before we leave,

653
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,120
I have to ask you

654
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,760
for three words that you would

655
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,320
use to describe yourself.

656
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,080
Oh.

657
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,760
I would say the three words

658
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,320
are adventurous,

659
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,280
sarcastic and curious.

660
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,880
I love that. I love that.

661
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,760
Jennifer, thank you very, very much.

662
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,720
This was a really, really great.

663
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,400
And stay safe and stay healthy.

664
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:43,960
Thank you.

665
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,800
This was so much fun.

666
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,680
I appreciate it.

667
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
And happy holidays.

668
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,600
Happy holidays.
