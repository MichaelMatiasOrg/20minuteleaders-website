Lior Aviram, thank you for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? I am well, considering these corona days. Pleasure to be with you. Pleasure to be with you. I mean, I'm saying, I was about to say good morning, but it's actually your evening soon. Even though the sun still seems to shine. You're in Israel right now, right? Right. Right. And the sun is setting right behind me. That's wonderful. That's wonderful. Lior, it's a privilege to have you. It's an honor to have you. Because your 25 years of experience in the legal field, and within Shibolet, and within high tech, as a young entrepreneur coming into this journey, even though I do get exposed to venture capital quite a bit now, seeing the legal side of things and understanding the complexity of things that go into the life cycle of a startup to M&As, to investments, it's something that's almost like a big black box to a lot of entrepreneurs. Not just young entrepreneurs, I'm assuming. And what I'd love to do in this discussion is dumb it down for me. And I want to explore, what are the things that I can be curious about? What are the things that I maybe shouldn't be curious about? And what are the biggest pitfalls that I can avoid as a young entrepreneur? But before that, Lior, just, I'd like to know who you are. And take me a little bit through your journey of going into the high tech. Already in the early 90s, as you mentioned before, it was considered high tech. Right, right. So, I started doing high tech before there was an Israeli high tech. Just because, before in 1990 there were no venture capital in Israel. So, I was lucky enough just by coincidence, like all good things in life, or lucky enough, to be among the lawyers that started to work with VCs early 90s. We actually needed to invent the subject in Israel. So, what we did is, took the books of the MVCA from California. And translated them into Hebrew, not in the language linguistic sense, but in the legal sense. And it was quite an experience because just to then negotiate and explain to the other lawyers in Israel why you need preferred shares, and all those issues that are just, you know that, everyone knows that. But then it was like something, like a revolution. You hear their revolution. It's literally pioneering a lot of these formal definitions and communications between the different parties. And it must have been quite an experience. What made you going to that side of high tech? So, as you're getting exposed to these different things, you choose to concentrate on them. You choose to be a pioneer in this domain. Why? Why do you do that? Oh, that's easy. That's easy to answer. You know, Israel pre-high tech, it's like the covid-19, pre and post. Nothing will be the same. But much more. Okay? I hope, much more than that. Israel pre-high tech, in the legal sense, in the legal profession, was something that's not going to change. The larger clients, where they are at that point, I was a young lawyer, there was no other field where you can start with smallest client ever. Like, to intrapreneurs, and turn into within two years, to have a huge client, the largest in the firm. And this is exactly what happened, to a few of our clients. So, for me, it was easy. I was young enough those days to adapt to the change. So, we actually, it was natural to stay where it's low hanging fruit in the legal profession at that time, which is the fruits nowadays are much higher. That I can assure you. Yeah. So, now is there, I mean, let's say, you're now looking at new opportunities and let's say, you have new founders. I mean, I'm looking at myself. As I start a company, I don't have the funds to go and pay a lawyer and pay a legal firm, and the caliber of Shibolet, yet I want to have the best caliber because I truly believe in my business and I truly believe of where I'm going and then my fundraising skills. So, what adaptations are there for the tech scene that might be a little different than any other industry in terms of partnering with a firm like Shibolet to work together? Is it the same as other industries? Or, is it a little bit different? Okay. So, I think that we started with the right foot in the sense. The fact that things move very fast in the high tech scene allows us to basically do things that are unheard of in other fields of the legal industry. So, we have programs of fees that are actually arranged for start phase. So, if we believe in your startup, so, we are actually, in most cases, the first investors in your startup. If you are an entrepreneur, you come to the lawyer. Lawyer in many cases, is just the first station that you park. And because this is the first advice and it should be the first advice that you get. And in order to avoid from mistakes. Later on at that time, you are in the most vulnerable stage in your career, it's easy to make mistakes. It's difficult to recover because you are too weak at that point. So, that's the reason that we are actually equipped to take over all the stuff of those startups that we believe in. And it's not easy, actually. So, we look at the team. It's not easy to filter. We use our best senses and we do lots of mistakes. Because we are not a better investors than any other investor. And we all do 90% mistakes. Sorry? How is your due diligence compared to that of venture capitalists? We are not into the technology side at all. So, we look at the people. We look at their background. We hear the story. And if we need, we take advice from friends that are more into the technology side. Or, we talked with potential investors and we hear from them. And sometimes we just, we feel the personality. You need actually to try to locate the winners. That's the issue. It's people at that point. So, we don't have all the tools in the world, but we have our experience. And in many cases, we do it in teams. So, I have a partner who is coming to me, Look, I have this young startup. It's in the area of so and so. And they want to do this and this. And I'm actually, I'm not sure. So, sometimes I meet with them again. Sometimes we talk. We do a little bit of due diligence about the team. That's it. That's what we have. We are doing the best with what we have at that point. Okay. That's incredible. And what excites you most in this job? Is it more the early stage entrepreneurs? Is it the bigger clients that they grow to? Where are you on the spectrum? Actually, all over it. There is a lot of interest in partner. And I look at me, us, as partners of the entrepreneurs. That's what we are. We are with them in the trenches. We feel the task, we are there. So, with them, it's in the beginning, you feel, you create something. You are a creator. You bring value. Other value than what they have. Which is a lot of experience and so forth. And they bring their innocence, which is very important for a stuff like this, right? Right. So, that's at that stage. But you know what? What's interesting in the tech area is that, no matter how mature is the technology company, they always struggle for life. They are struggling. So, in many cases, the lawyer is the only friend, true friend of the CEO. What does that mean? Because I'm imagining a company that the deal fell through. Maybe like, a big customer is no longer a paying customer, or, they are having a hard time raising their series As, so, what do you mean that you are the only friend of the CEO or that you're in there with the trenches? Because it's hard for me to imagine that a legal firm, being a friend of the CEO, it seems like it's not a friendship relationship. It's much more of a formal relationship. Okay. Look, this is the difference in I think, at least, in the way we do lawyering. That there is an issue of chemistry with your lawyer. You need to trust the lawyer. The advice that the lawyer gives you. And the fact in many cases, look, if a client's leaves, you can't do anything, right? When you are a lawyer. But the question, whether to go and do haircuts in salaries, or to do layoffs, for example, any other person in the company has its own interests, right? You are not interested. You are just there. You are his adviser. So, this is a very unique position. And this is one of the most fascinating things about being the lawyer for entrepreneurs, or CEOs, whoever. That's the take. In other industries, it's not like that. The pace is very different. Managements are figure in many cases. With technology companies, even the CEO or the most experienced person, at least in the Israeli arena, has done three M&As in his life. Right. Right. Me, I did 300. You see? So, that's a big difference. Right? Right. So, I greatly enjoy this. So, first of all, it sounds to me that another key difference from what you're explaining then what a VC might have, is in the terms of the risk assessment. So, the risk that you're taking on as a firm, when you take on to, to entrepreneurs or to engineers from the Technion or whatever, it's a different risk than what a VC might take when they're making their one out of six investment. So, a VC might make six investments a year. But you're able to take 60 clients a year or perhaps even more. And so, you're seeing many more deals and you're obviously seeing many more success and failure stories. And I have to ask then, if you're seeing so many of these deals, both the successes and failures, there must be some patterns that start coming together again, whether it is pitfalls in the early stage, pitfalls in the late stage. Maybe common successes or common traits of an entrepreneur that are among on the successful ones. But what have you been observing in your years? I think that there are endless factors. That's reality. And it's very easy to fail. So, there are a million reasons to fail. And so, only if all the stars are aligned that this is very rare, then you see a big success. But let's move from early stage. Early stage, when you are just the first team, It should be a coherent team. And the team should be in most cases, very clearly defined. There is a technology guy. There is a business guy. And they should actually be work well together in the sense that the qualities of one are making for the disadvantages of the other. And you can actually, if you are a little bit into people, you understand them and you see that. You see that the conversation flows and things work. Yep. And at that point, it's very important to clear each of the entrepreneurs, founders at that point, that they are the founders, right? So, their role to make sure that they understand, and they set expectations, and so forth. So, and it's easy at that point to make a mistake. Not to define things. Work three months, and then three months or six months down the road, discover actually, you are not aligned. Like waterfall. Yup. Yes. And one goes away, and the other is staying there. Doesn't have the rights to the technology. The other one is fighting for shares if there will be a company, and then everything is just lost. Do you see a lot of pre-emptive conflicts in regards to shares, equity, salary, IP? Is there too much of that, of pre-emptive conflicts that are just stalling and not letting the entrepreneur continue? Too many. I'm not sure what is too many. But I can tell you that, I would say that, in about 25% the quarter of the cases, that's the issue. Now, let's add the first stage or the next stage, is the investors. Their identity. They're easy to make mistakes. You will take onboard the wrong guys, and all of a sudden, when you go to the next level of investors, you are stuck. They are making troubles. They make your life miserable. Do you advise or do you provide opinions on the term sheets that the entrepreneur receives in terms of the future of the company? So, for example, if I receive a term sheet for an investor in a seed that wants preferred stock and wants a board seat and etc, etc, do you sometimes come in and say, "Michael, just be be careful." "I've seen this thing before." "And I'm not happy with the way it's gonna go in the next rounds." Yes. Sure. This is basic. And we are trying, first, in the tech world, and this is the DNA that actually we try to convey to everyone on the team is, there is no business issue or legal issue. Everything is relevant to us. So, when I see a term sheet, I give my input to the entrepreneur, assuming that I'm the advisor for the entrepreneur, on everything. The identity or the way the investor behaves, the term sheet, the terms of term sheet, the future, what is reflected, if these are the terms that are asked by the investor and so forth. So, I'm trying to really be as meaningful as possible in this sense and not give legal comments. Legal comments, every five years of lawyer can give. So, my added value is not there. And we are trying to do even more than that. Look, we have a team which is business development for clients Because we, all of a sudden, a couple of years ago discovered, we see a mountain of information that can assist entrepreneurs and investors. And in most law firms, no one is doing anything with that. Right. So, we have a team of three people that sit on that data and try to assist. So, we try to give input really deeper than just the term sheet. Even to add with additional investors and so forth. Wow. It's one of the 300 M&As. So, it's okay. Lior, this is all incredible. Young entrepreneur, I'm going to start my own company soon. What are the things that I should be most concerned about or excited about as I start my journey? When is the first touch point that I need to make with a firm like Shibolet or some other legal firm? And what is the number one thing to keep in mind? Because, as you're saying this is not just, I'm not just asking for Shibolets to incorporate me, I'm asking for a partnership. I'm asking for them to come with me on this journey. And I want them to be in the trenches with me, so I better have good chemistry with them. Right. So, I think that to the right point is at the first minute that you have, like usually it's a team, right, of two or three people, so, once that the core team, the founders to be the founders, agree that they have a good idea, that they are determined to push through together, that is the right time to come to us, or, to any other lawyer. So, as soon as you're agreeing that you're gonna go into this 10-year journey, into this marathon, and you know that you're working together, then, this is the right touch point. Right. Right. Wonderful. Any later, you may be wasting time or doing a mistake that will be detrimental later on. So, that's the reason that we are the first stop, actually. Before you come into any other. Because, as far as I was concerned, today, you can incorporate $500 in Delaware online, and you can start your journey, and you can start writing your product. And maybe, when you go to that pre-seed stage and then you need to quickly get a term sheet, and then you go and you quickly find the first legal firm that says hi to you, but you're saying, no, this is actually a long term investment. This is a partnership. One of the most important partnerships you're gonna have in the lifetime of your company. And so, thank you for teaching that. Lior, right before we leave, I want to thank you again for your generosity with your time and your inspiration. And the 25 years of experience you bring with you, I think that's incredible. And I've learned so much. And I'm sure that anybody listening has learned so much. But I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. Okay. So, actually, I will use I think, one word. I'm a multi disciplinary. And that's with respect to personality and qualifications or talent. So, that's me. I'm around person. I love it. I love it. Leon, toda raba. It came out as an American. Toda raba. Toda raba. My pleasure. Every conversation is changing. Hebrew and English, it's becoming impossible. So, I do the same. My pleasure. There you go. All right. And hopefully we get to work together on n venture that I hope to create very soon. Very happy to, Michael. Take care. Enjoy. Bye bye. Bye.
