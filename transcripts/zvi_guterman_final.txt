1 We are able to change so many things that were impossible before, and it's only the beginning. That's my view of this world. And I'm excited every day. And that's what I love about my again, actually what I do. Zvi Guterman, thank you for being on my show 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? Very well, thank you. Pleasure to be here. Thank you for taking time out of your busy day to be here. You're coming from my favorite industry. And I'm excited talk about cyber, about cloud. But even more than those two, I'm excited to talk about the entrepreneurial journey of a serial entrepreneur that is now 14 years into the making of CloudShare, an incredible company in the cloud space with so many incredible customers. But besides cloud share, you also have some incredible experience, like a lecturing and advising groups like Innovation Endeavors, and being on the board of companies. So, all around, just an incredible trajectory. Zvi, who are you? How do you get started with computer science? And what is really your passion with what you're doing? So, I started my career actually, because I love technology. Like many others, as a teenager, I was playing with computers in the early days. So, I was born in the 70s, early 70s. '73 to be accurate. And as I was growing, we got the first computers to Israel, ZX Spectrum at that time, Atari, and later the PC. And it was amazing. And it was, again, I remember the fact that you can write code and do something, play games and you can start having this device do things for you. And I think we were lucky and I'm fortunate to be able to witness that. And I say to many people that we're fortunate we are in the middle of a second industrial revolution where the computer is changing. We, sometimes we say, software eating the world. But I think we, in the good sense, hopefully, we are able to change so many things that were impossible before. And it's only the beginning. That's my view of this world. And I'm excited every day. And that's what I love about my, again actually what I do is that we learn, we try new things, we change the world a little bit, and it's wonderful to do that. Wonderful. Take me back to your childhood when you're witnessing this change. Because I am assuming that most kids around you aren't necessarily as excited or as infatuated with this technology as you are, correct me if I'm wrong. But what was that experience really like? For me, I should add that I wasn't good enough in basketball and soccer. So, I guess it's always that you compensate. I love it. So, I was very good with math and computer science then. And again, it was clear that you could do things. And again, as I said, I wasn't so good, I enjoyed playing basketball and I'm relatively tall, but I wasn't good enough. I was a swimmer in high school, semiprofessional. And I understood very quickly that I want to be the best swimmer in all the best athletes in any way. And I was really good in math and computer science, physics. And it was the early days of computer science. And it was so exciting. So, I really loved it. My mother really wanted me to go to med school, and was encouraging and pushing. And computer science was a new thing. So, it wasn't very established and they actually weren't aware that I'm going to study that. But I really had the passion and they supported me. And then one thing led to the other. Like I finish my bachelor, I did my master, and then I did my PhD. And it was, I kept finding new things. And then a friend told me, "Hey, let's start the company together." And that turned into my security company. And I think, again, in many ways, you know, I'll say something maybe for other people that may be listening or watching this, I think we we're fortunate that in a way, you know, we sometimes, some of us look super small to the big heroes. But I'll say about myself, I think we, a lot of things are just timing. And it's such a wonderful opportunity, the world is changing and you are in the right spot. So, it's not that we are smarter than other people that, but in many cases just we were in the right time in this wave of innovation. We understood it and many of us are using it and developing interesting applications. And that's actually maybe interconnected to other things that I know that you are talking in interesting many people, that's still the motivation for me. If you ask me what is like, where do I want to go next with my company and other companies if I'm looking and joining on the board level or investor, is finding innovation. Finding something that is not trivial, that software can improve. And we see a lot of innovation around health, around enterprise IT that keep improving our work. And that's what gets me excited. I love that. And now, correct me if I'm wrong but the timeline that I'm looking at right here says that you are doing your PhD from 2004 to 2008, but you were the CTO of Safend from 2003 to 2006. So, you were basically starting and sold the company while you were doing your PhD in the Hebrew University, correct? Yes. And I won't to recommend it to others. It's not the best path. And we actually, so, you can do better. Yeah. It's not the best path Like, I feel that I didn't contribute enough to Safend. And I would encourage the other people to focus on one thing and try to do that all hearted. But yes, I was, I really enjoyed the academic world. And I found the research actually on security in crypto. And even on that side, I really was focusing on how to bridge the complex meth crypto world and the real world and find real solutions to these problems. No no no. Not at all. Do me a favor, because you know, when I'm looking at a lot of the people of my age, not necessarily coming out of units like the 8200 or 81, but around the world that are studying computer science. And if I look at the things that they're really excited about in the companies that early, that early entrepreneurs, young entrepreneurs are creating, they're not usually in the crypto world, in the cybersecurity world. They're in like the more sexier consumer world. Can you give me a little bit of insight into what is so exciting to you and so appealing to you about the complex math, cryptography, cloud based solutions that you've been working on for these decades? Sure. By the way, I was asking is your picture disappeared. Maybe its a Zoom challenges So, two things. And I say these are two areas that maybe I should talk about. One is actually in my career, I actually dealt more with B2B enterprise businesses that you mentioned about young founders, talking about the consumer ideas, etc. So, on that side, I usually, when I meet young entrepreneurs, I would say two things. One, even on the financial aspect, usually a B2B startups are 10 times more successful in the end result, more rewarding. And about 100 times less competitive. Really? And usually, again, if you come with a new Twitter, usually you'll find again in the numbers the multiplies, and let's say if I'm wrong, only 10 times. So, usually it's natural that we come more with the consumer idea because we are all consumers. Right? But actually, what I would encourage someone, take a step back, don't focus on your, how you can improve Twitter a little bit. But, hey, look at the industry and go find a CIO that work for oil and gas and ask to join him for a day or maybe for a week. Do an internship. And see what kind of challenges they face. You'll be amazed that people are dealing with multi, tens and hundreds of billions of markets and problems that are just far away from you. Let's talk about today, covid-19. I have a good friend. She works for Pfizer and she shared with me just the complexity of the FDA system. It's a software system that is dealing with the experiments. And now, and actually, she talked with me about it three years ago. And she kept talking to me you know, that's a place for innovation. So, every founder that came to me I said, "Go, speak with her. This is her domain." You're targeting 20 companies, but that's an important area. And now this is it, you came well, this is so important. People are dealing with that daily. But that's one example. That's my view, that usually for us, again, we used to think as consumers, but definitely it's when we are young. But actually, the enterprise market is big, interesting and usually somewhat easier and more rewarding. Again, if you're passionate, of course, if your are passionate for something, go with it. But just one observation, it's interesting. Back to your question on crypto. What I found about crypto, which I think is amazing and unique to that domain, is that actually crypto is the junction of crossroads of many things. One complex math. Like complexity and combinatorics and a lot of really interesting things. Second, it's something that if you, I did my PhD in computer science, you're always in areas that are semi theoretical. And then people are doing things that are, you're not sure how practical are. Crypto, is one of the most practical things we deal with. So, the fact that crypto has an amazing influence on Second World War, I think when you think about the enigma and into the what we are using now and the security challenges that Zoom had and many things. So, it's super practical, very interesting on the academic level. And so many problems are still, are still open and have room to walk around. So, I think for young researchers and young entrepreneurs, there's a lot to do. And we still face a lot of challenges. And I'll give you maybe, one example I think that we witnessed in the last, we witnessed in the last year is cyber war games. Again, something that I was working in the last year. It's a new domain that's really growing. And it's so impressive to see a lot of innovation. So, cyber war games, in short, you're trying to replicate and create scenarios that will train people how to react in real time and how to do better. And it goes from something very simple. For example, there's a very nice company that, again, the most dangerous element in security is us, human being. Because we do human mistakes. And the biggest mistake is people phishing emails that you press the wrong link and you start a wire transfer or you were pull a wire transfer by mistake and etc. There is a very nice company that is just dealing with that element. And actually, if you are the corporate, let's say, again, Coke, and you buy their service, they start sending phishing emails to your IPO, maybe more than that, to your finance, etc. And they collect the data, compress that, and they come to you and say, you know what, here are 10 people, maybe you should better educate them because they are unaware. I love that. That's amazing. And it's a wonderful, wonderful solution. So, simple and nice. And I love this kind of elegant solutions then they are wire and they can charge $2 per user per month, whatever the metric is. And so nice. And you don't even need, like, complex crypto for that. You see a lot of the innovation these days around multiparty computation. This is actually one of the most advanced things in crypto. A lot of research in recent years around how we break a secret that, and how we between stuff on secret sharing that we kind of, we break a secret between five people that any three of them together can open the safe, but one or two together cannot do anything. Or how do we take something very complex and very important and we distribute it between different computers and allow each of them to do a slow computation. Well actually, if you break into one of them, you will not learn anything about the secret. Let's say you calculate some insurance ratio, whatever that is classified or whatever, or has privacy issues. So, you want if someone breaks into a computer, the secrets will not be revealed. So, there's a lot of interesting innovation. It's also very challenging. And I should say also, on the other hand, entrepreneurs should be worried or should consider at least not to do a Me Too, kind of again using Me Too, but in another context startup. Because the other challenge that we see in security, we see a lot of companies that are somewhat with the bigger need for security doing very similar solutions. So you see, like a lot of new firewalled companies. They don't call themselves, they do targeted attacks and they only analyze the yellow packets that are going outside them. So, I would encourage entrepreneurs to be careful from going that way because that's really risky place. And going back to the beginning of the conversation where you mentioned about innovation. And that's at the end, what's most exciting, what's most appealing, perhaps to you as a board member and an investor. But really, that's also what's really warms the heart and makes somebody, I think, truly passionate and feel innovative. So, talking about innovation, I think that's a perfect segue. We have just a short amount of time but I'd love to hear a little bit of a 14 year journey through CloudShare. First and foremost, what is it like running a company for 14 years? I don't think many entrepreneurs get to have that privilege. Yeah. It's like [--], you should multiply that by something. Yeah. It's definitely a long journey. And I should say, and also again, for hopefully for entrepreneurs that listening to that and thinking about the beginning of their journey, one, I did a lot of mistakes. And people should understand it's a long journey. On average, it's 10 years And you should find out, first, actually, if you are in the right room and I think one of the things that happened in the last 20 years change definitely, that it's easier to be an entrepreneur and which is great, right. We see a lot of accelerators and a lot of programs that actually help you stuff and I'm the last to judge but the first question I'm asking entrepreneurs, just make sure that you are in the right room, that you're doing the right thing. Because it looks glamorous and you may think that I'm just celebrating between cocktail parties and you see my name on all sorts of press releases. But the reality is that it's really hard work. And there are a lot of fires when you manage people. You need to hire, you to grow. Sometimes, things are not working. And it's a long journey. And first thing you need to be ready and love it. And again, for myself, I found out throughout the years that I'm really excited about working with people, setting the strategy, solving all of these challenges. 14 years is a long period and definitely, the company change itself along the way. We started actually we called the ourselves IT structure when we started the company. And it was all around IT and the need to configure virtual machines where you look 14 years after we talk about business acceleration cloud. We try with our platform to help people do more business and allow them to grow their business and use the experience that head on experience of their software in the cloud. So, we actually help training organizations and serve organization to provide hands on experience. And it was a complete journey. Other things, we raised a lot of money. Raised over $30 million from VC's. We almost sold the company at least once. We really did due diligence for a three hundred million dollar deal that didn't work out. I didn't do very well on the board level. I did many mistakes. And the board encouraged or reinforced and brought the very seasoned CEO. It almost killed the company. So, I witnessed a lot of things. Then we did the management buyout. The last five years we already [--] and going year over year with nice multiplier. It's definitely challenging. I think again, for me, I found out that that's really exciting as well. But it has a lot of challenges. And as you mentioned, definitely software, 14 years it's like 100 years. Like the architecture of the software is so different, etc. I can't even imagine. One of the things that we're going to have to leave to the next episode that we'll do one day is how to remain innovative in a 14-year period. And you're mentioning that in software, it's like a 100 years. And I'm looking at, you know, I am looking at companies that I got a chance to be involved in. And, for example, the Israeli Defense Force, the softwares that I built in 2014 and 2015, I already had to refactor. And in 2016, we had to kill and create a new software because the world has changed already. So, I can empathize a lot with this problem. And we'll have to wait that for the next episode. But Zvi, I want to thank you for being so generous with your time. Unfortunately, I called the show 20 Minutes Leaders I should have called it 30 minute leaders. But I have to ask you the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. Hopefully, this junction of product, technology and business I love that. Probably that's what I learned, that I'm really excited about doing. I started my career with that on the technology side. And all the time I know that's what actually where I try to accelerate and excel and drive results. Zvi, we thank you for sharing with me your passion, your curiosity. I gained so much inspiration from it. Thank you very much. Toda raba. And stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you, Michael. Happy to be here.
