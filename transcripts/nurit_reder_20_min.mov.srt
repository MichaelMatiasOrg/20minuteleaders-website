1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,840
Opportunities and boundaries

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,400
were way larger and bigger.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,520
And the world has so much to offer us.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,800
But sometimes we are living in a box.

5
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,280
Nurit Reder, thank you so much

6
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,040
for being on my show.

7
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,520
How are you?

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm very good, thank you for having me.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,280
Thank you so much for being here.

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,520
Where are you calling from right now?

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,280
I'm at my home office,

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,240
which used to be my daughter's room.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,160
And yes, this is my new office,

14
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,600
which I think painted half pink.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,320
I love it.

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,560
To make it more happy.

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,640
Amazing.

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,040
So, Nurit, you have such

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,000
a phenomenal track record

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,760
from so many CEO, CFO, VP positions

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,360
and so many different companies.

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,080
And just among them, WIX,

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,760
that everybody here would know about.

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,680
But give me a little bit of context

25
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,920
as to the journey

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,120
that you've gone through

27
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,320
and what really excites you

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,520
about joining new endeavors,

29
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,400
starting new endeavors.

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,600
You're involved in so many things

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,120
at the same time

32
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,400
that I just love to pick your brain

33
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,960
on several spots throughout your journey

34
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,520
and get some insight into things

35
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,840
that I can push forward

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,160
in my own journey later on.

37
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,160
So, Nurit, take me back.

38
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,680
Who are you?

39
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,000
Wow. Okay.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,840
So, I'm from Israel.

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,560
I was born and raised in Israel.

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,280
Currently I live in Ramat Hasharon.

43
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,920
And I'm married with two kids,

44
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,320
two teenagers.

45
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,560
My career started at a very young age.

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,680
I was very lucky to join the

47
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,440
financial adviser to the chief of staff

48
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,520
as somebody who was only 21 years old,

49
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,640
in charge of billions

50
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,840
and billions of shekels.

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,840
It was a great start.

52
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,520
I'm working with the Knesset

53
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,640
and Ministry of Treasury.

54
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,080
Yeah, I'm not sure I knew how to,

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,120
how much how big it was.

56
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,920
When you are 21, you are very bold

57
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,400
and nothing scares you.

58
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,240
You have very little life experience.

59
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,680
So,

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,200
so, it's a good time to start.

61
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,680
When I was a finance officer,

62
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,880
and when I finished my service

63
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,960
in the army, I started my career.

64
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,920
And then I just,

65
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,040
I fulfilled many positions

66
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,640
in finance and operations.

67
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,200
I was CFO of several exciting

68
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,400
high tech companies.

69
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,640
I was in charge of operations and HR.

70
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,720
I can tell you, by the way,

71
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,520
that one of the smart things

72
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,040
that I can tell,

73
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,800
I made many mistakes.

74
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,280
But one good thing that I did

75
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,200
is took every opportunity

76
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,600
that came through.

77
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,080
I just jumped in.

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,320
And this is a major factor

79
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,720
in my career because

80
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,080
I had the opportunity

81
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,840
not to deal only with finance,

82
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,840
I could take operational responsibility,

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,560
and IT opportunity.

84
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,080
And so, I found myself

85
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,320
fulfilling not only CFO positions,

86
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,200
but also in charge of HR,

87
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
and sometimes IT.

88
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,800
And it really enriched my career.

89
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,240
And then, in 2013,

90
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,000
I had this amazing opportunity again.

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,680
Again, a huge door was opened to WIX.

92
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,560
And I must say again,

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,840
that I got to know WIX in 2008.

94
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,600
My amazing neighbor, Omer Shai,

95
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,080
told me about this amazing company

96
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,360
that is called WIX.

97
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,440
And that I don't know if many people

98
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,800
heard of it back then, I didn't.

99
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,760
2008. Wow.

100
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,600
Yes.

101
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,080
But then I went to a meeting there.

102
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,840
Nothing, you know,

103
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,680
came to something real.

104
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,520
But a few years later, I met again

105
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,360
with Avishai and Nir, the one and only.

106
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,840
And Nir and Avishai

107
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,560
and the two and only maybe.

108
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,440
And then they offered me to be this,

109
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,000
in this position of VP of operations,

110
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,560
which I

111
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,320
didn't really know what it meant.

112
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,760
I'm not sure they knew.

113
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,280
But I just felt it in my gut

114
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,440
that I would never say no to it.

115
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,160
And I jumped right in.

116
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,920
And these were,

117
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,880
you know, amazing five years in which

118
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,520
I did anything but the things

119
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,920
that I did before.

120
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,160
I was managing,

121
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,360
I was leading Customer Solutions group.

122
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,720
I was managing WIX's assets.

123
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,720
I had the opportunity to establish,

124
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,880
to establish the WIX Hub.

125
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,760
What is the WIX Hub?

126
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,560
The WIX Hub,

127
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,320
was the first time that we realized that,

128
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,920
you know, WIX is an online product,

129
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,160
right?

130
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,840
That online and offline must be,

131
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,400
or on-life and online must be connected.

132
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,600
There is no other way.

133
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,480
And our customers

134
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,960
were small, medium businesses

135
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,560
and we wanted to hear them.

136
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,960
So, the Hub connected between those

137
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,120
small and medium businesses owners

138
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,920
and our product.

139
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,600
In one way, one hand we could hear

140
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,960
what they need

141
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,560
and how they use our product.

142
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,640
And on the other hand,

143
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,840
we could help them

144
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,520
use the product better

145
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,760
with training, with seminars.

146
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,480
It was like, you know,

147
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,240
a place full of activity.

148
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,040
Started in Israel, continued in the US.

149
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,960
And, you know, along the way,

150
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,840
we also established the accelerator

151
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,680
for women entrepreneurs.

152
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,880
So, entrepreneurship

153
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,280
was the name of the game in WIX.

154
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,600
Yes, I myself, by the way,

155
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,400
during that time,

156
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,920
I established my nonprofit

157
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,520
called Dalit.

158
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,200
It's a personal story.

159
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,800
I wanted to raise awareness

160
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,320
for excessive blood clotting.

161
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,360
And I now have a community

162
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,760
of four thousand members.

163
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,640
And we won, like Knesset award.

164
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,320
But trust me,

165
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,760
it's a long way to go still.

166
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,560
But I can tell you

167
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,680
that WIX affected me doing that.

168
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,600
It's, again, that thing of the community

169
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,280
and this element of the community,

170
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,360
how you create a community,

171
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,280
how you deliver the message,

172
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,720
how do you

173
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,720
create a shared purpose.

174
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
So, this is, by the way,

175
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,280
a whole new area that we can,

176
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,760
I can talk about for hours.

177
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,480
Well, I want to also go back

178
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,440
for a second.

179
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,800
Because I'm seeing a pattern here

180
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,760
of jumping on to opportunities.

181
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,600
You're talking about

182
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,440
finding yourself at 21,

183
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
being the aide to the chief of staff

184
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,880
with regards to financials.

185
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,240
And then going on to

186
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,680
various CFO positions

187
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,640
and landing at the end

188
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,240
with the VP operations at WIX,

189
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,960
even though you have no idea

190
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,760
what VP operations does.

191
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,520
So, take to me little bit

192
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
about this mindset,

193
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,760
this growth mindset

194
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,920
of harnessing opportunities

195
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,400
and moving forward with them.

196
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,560
Well, okay.

197
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,400
So,

198
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,000
I can talk about a few things.

199
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,400
One,

200
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
I was always a dreamer.

201
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,520
I thought I was a dreamer.

202
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,760
I thought I aimed high.

203
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,120
And so, I didn't limit myself

204
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,280
only to being,

205
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,040
you know, at the age of 21,

206
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,800
my dream was to be a CFO of a company.

207
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,360
But then,

208
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,720
I kind of

209
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,560
reached it quite early,

210
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,360
And then, I

211
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,640
I didn't know where to aim next.

212
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,160
And it was quite confusing.

213
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,440
I very much believe in aiming high.

214
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:12,320
But when I came to WIX,

215
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,000
I understood I was not aiming at all.

216
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,160
I mean opportunities and boundaries

217
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,720
were way larger and bigger

218
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,840
and the world has so much to offer us.

219
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,640
But sometimes we are living in a box.

220
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,840
And I found out

221
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,160
that I cannot live in a box.

222
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,280
I mean, from time to time,

223
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,880
I returned to my box,

224
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,480
but it never lasts.

225
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,520
So, my box is that is finance.

226
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,840
But my gut was stronger

227
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,160
than the box thing.

228
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,280
And I can tell you that

229
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,520
every time a door opened,

230
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,480
whether it was being a CFO

231
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,280
of a product division at the age of 27,

232
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,040
where it was selling

233
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,680
for one hundred million dollars,

234
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,880
I jumped into it.

235
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,320
When my boss was sick

236
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,600
and somebody had to take some project

237
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,360
going to the US presenting IT project,

238
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,040
I also jumped into it.

239
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:11,240
I just didn't say no

240
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,320
to new opportunities.

241
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,280
When it scared me, I went for it.

242
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,840
And this was one good thing that I did.

243
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,680
But I think that you should always dream.

244
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,000
Like there is this book that I read,

245
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,120
the 10 times rule or something like that.

246
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,640
You need to dream really

247
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,040
like a big and scary dreams.

248
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,840
Because then you know,

249
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,160
you are doing the you know,

250
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,160
you are aiming to the right direction.

251
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,480
Wow.

252
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,480
That's very, very cool.

253
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,280
Yes, I think that I always put, I mean,

254
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,560
my career was always important for me.

255
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,520
I put it first.

256
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,320
Maybe it's not that popular

257
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,480
to say it when you are a mother,

258
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,600
or a politically correct.

259
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,920
But I can tell you that

260
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,360
I don't know any other way

261
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,000
to succeed in something

262
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,920
that you are aiming to accelerate.

263
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,520
If you want to succeed in something,

264
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,200
you can just tell yourself:

265
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,280
okay, it's a Saturday

266
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,720
and I'm forgetting about work.

267
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,840
It's merging into your life.

268
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,120
And I have very, I mean,

269
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,720
I have many examples

270
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,200
of why it's important

271
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,400
and why when you are focused,

272
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,600
you can succeed.

273
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,840
So, this is another thing

274
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,360
that I can tell you.

275
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,080
So, give me a little bit of insight

276
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,800
into the mistakes you've made.

277
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,520
You've mentioned that

278
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,760
you've made a lot of mistakes

279
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,200
along the way,

280
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,520
but you've grown from there

281
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,800
and you've learned from them.

282
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,280
So, what are some mistakes

283
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,080
that you single out along the way

284
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,760
that are clear to you

285
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
that they'd helped you

286
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,000
in your trajectory?

287
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,520
Whether it's through learning

288
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,400
or empathy or just understanding.

289
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,160
Yeah, well, that's a very good question,

290
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,960
and I've been thinking about it a lot.

291
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,080
So, one thing is that

292
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,840
I didn't aim high enough.

293
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
I can tell you that.

294
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,840
I have that intrapreneurship in me

295
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,800
for forever.

296
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,480
And only now I reached the point

297
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,200
where I'm doing my own thing,

298
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,920
my own business.

299
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,120
Something that I'm super,

300
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,480
super passionate about.

301
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,640
That I'm willing to

302
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,360
invest immensely at

303
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,000
and without any boundaries.

304
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,280
Well, I have that privilege

305
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,680
that my kids are older now,

306
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
so I have more time.

307
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,000
But I can tell you

308
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,400
that it wasn't the case

309
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,760
in the last 20 years of a career.

310
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,440
It was not always,

311
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,400
and when at WIX, for example,

312
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,680
I had opportunities

313
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,680
that I was amazed to be given.

314
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,560
I just gave everything.

315
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,960
And I didn't always,

316
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,320
I wasn't always

317
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,280
lucky to have those opportunities.

318
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,400
But you need to create

319
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,360
your own opportunities.

320
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,320
That was something

321
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,640
that I should have,

322
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,040
and you need to be

323
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,360
fearless.

324
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,680
And I was scared of many things.

325
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,360
Going to do my own thing was something

326
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,200
that was inconceivable to me.

327
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,280
Now, at a later age, I now I dare.

328
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,480
And so, this is one thing I can tell you.

329
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,160
There are so many.

330
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,960
Well, so, about this daring

331
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,600
and trying new things,

332
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
you approach these opportunities

333
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600
and how do you navigate your environment?

334
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,720
So, there's expectation of you

335
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,600
from others.

336
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,880
There's expectation of you from yourself.

337
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,120
And then there's what your actual

338
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,560
skill sets are at that moment.

339
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,880
And you know that there is going to be

340
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,280
a big learning curve and a big, you know,

341
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,600
a big journey to get there.

342
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,960
So, it sounds like

343
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,640
a pretty lonely journey

344
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,480
to sometimes be in that phase

345
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,920
where they are expecting something

346
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,680
and now you have to own up to it

347
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,200
and now you have

348
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,640
to do this internal journey

349
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,080
to reach that milestone, right?

350
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,680
Yes.

351
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,160
Wow. That's an amazing question.

352
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,800
So, this goes back

353
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,160
to doing right or wrong

354
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,840
in  making decisions.

355
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,640
So, I think my conclusion is that,

356
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:08,560
the only way you can succeed

357
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,280
while you would like to grow

358
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,120
is by partnering with a colleague,

359
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,120
with a few colleagues,

360
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,840
creating a coalition, having a partner.

361
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,200
When I did that,

362
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,520
and I not always used that  way.

363
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,240
But when I did it, it just flew.

364
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,400
It just you know,

365
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,920
I had a partner I will not say his name,

366
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,640
he was from a different discipline,

367
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,680
which is also important

368
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,920
because I come from finance,

369
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,880
operation, HR, I can do that,

370
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,080
but I cannot do R&D, for example.

371
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,680
And if I want to do something big,

372
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,320
if I wanted to do something big,

373
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,680
something as strategic,

374
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,320
something with impact,

375
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,680
so that was the only way

376
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,120
because you can't do it otherwise.

377
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,000
Certainly in a larger organization,

378
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,160
but also in a startup.

379
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,480
If you want to  do

380
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,400
an important move,

381
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,680
something that will really affect

382
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,800
the life of the company

383
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,600
and make you feel

384
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,320
like you gave your best,

385
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,560
you need to partner.

386
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:15,000
You need to complete your skills

387
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,200
with other people skills.

388
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
You cannot do it alone.

389
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,760
You simply cannot.

390
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,200
So,

391
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,920
that's the way I do.

392
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,600
What has been most exciting for you

393
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,920
on your journey?

394
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,120
Like, are there certain points in time

395
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,320
when you really feel like

396
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,560
you are your true self

397
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,160
and you're really fulfilling

398
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,720
your destiny?

399
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,680
Wow.

400
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,520
I'm not sure I know

401
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,480
what my destiny is yet.

402
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,680
I'm always hoping that

403
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,120
what I do currently

404
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,600
is the most exciting things.

405
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,400
And I feel like it right now

406
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,440
because we are in the beginning

407
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,200
of this journey

408
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,840
of creating our own startup

409
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,040
in something that I very much believe in,

410
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,600
something that I learned a lot

411
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,320
being at WIX.

412
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,760
Everything that I mentioned

413
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,720
about community.

414
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,280
I will tell you this,

415
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,520
when I was it WIX,

416
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,480
I was part of an employee community,

417
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,400
which I was very proud to be part of.

418
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,960
And I asked myself,

419
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,840
why was I so proud?

420
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,440
And the elements are coming

421
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,880
from different kinds of worlds.

422
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,800
One is, for example,

423
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,920
that you had your responsibility

424
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,360
on your shoulders.

425
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,080
You could do many initiatives,

426
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,520
you can lead things

427
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,720
that never existed before

428
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,120
in that organization,

429
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,480
but it was on your shoulder.

430
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,840
Everything was measured.

431
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,040
You can picture that with me.

432
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,880
When you enter every floor at WIX,

433
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,800
you can see graphs and numbers.

434
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,280
And for me as a finance person,

435
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,680
it was a shock because

436
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,520
everything was transparent.

437
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,760
But

438
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,560
the amazing thing which I realized

439
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,520
a few months after was that

440
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,160
it was aligning everybody.

441
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,960
Everybody knew company goals.

442
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,320
Everybody wanted the company to succeed

443
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,480
and they knew what it meant

444
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,520
to be successful.

445
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,760
And on top of everything

446
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,200
that I'm talking about right now,

447
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,360
which is like the business world,

448
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,720
everything was wrapped in this

449
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,880
gift wrap of

450
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,120
taking care of employees,

451
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,360
having many, many, many events.

452
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,040
You are always being seen.

453
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,480
You are on the stage.

454
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,880
Somebody is taking care of you.

455
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,960
You know that your voice is heard.

456
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,680
So, social element is very strong

457
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,960
and very much connected

458
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,320
to the business world.

459
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,360
So, what I'm doing right now

460
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,800
in my startup is trying to take

461
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,280
this to the online world.

462
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,960
Because this is where we're going to be.

463
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,600
I mean, as I said in the beginning,

464
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,720
online and on-life

465
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,080
will always be connected.

466
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,280
We are not going to run away from that.

467
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,440
But how do you create

468
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,720
an online organizational culture

469
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,240
in a platform?

470
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,960
How do you create all of these

471
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,280
amazing elements in the platform online?

472
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,120
So, this is something

473
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,520
that I'm very excited about,

474
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,400
very passionate about.

475
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,600
I hope it's going to fulfill my destiny.

476
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,120
But then again,

477
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,080
I don't know what my destiny is.

478
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,920
It's a big thing.

479
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,680
I need to think about it.

480
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,440
What are the most critical parts for you

481
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,400
as you think about

482
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
who you want to work with

483
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,960
and the people you want to

484
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,880
align yourself with,

485
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,120
whether it's for this startup

486
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,200
or for any other project?

487
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,680
Well, again,

488
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,040
people make everything.

489
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,280
This is something

490
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,360
that I learned along the way.

491
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,680
Sometimes you are taking people

492
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,920
with not exactly the skills

493
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,200
that you need.

494
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,520
But you know they are smart,

495
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,000
you know they have a heart,

496
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,600
and they know how to work together.

497
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,080
And in bad times,

498
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,240
this is the test, right?

499
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,480
So, there is no, you know,

500
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,920
you never work on a project

501
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,240
and it's all roses

502
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,040
and smelling like hearts.

503
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,960
Little hearts, I don't know

504
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,640
You have those obstacles

505
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,200
that you need to deal with.

506
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,360
And you need that person

507
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,240
to be next to you.

508
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,680
And I had the luck to have

509
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,800
a few people like this

510
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,360
near me

511
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,120
in those situations, bad situations.

512
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,440
And we are still, you know,

513
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,040
10 years past, 15 years past.

514
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,600
But it's not always the case.

515
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,160
So, it's again,

516
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,280
it's an intuition or friends.

517
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,920
And now, I am

518
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,400
I have partnered to a real friend.

519
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,800
So, this is why I'm so happy.

520
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,840
Nurit, thank you so much

521
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,960
for being generous with your time.

522
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,640
This is really, really great.

523
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,600
I really appreciate it.

524
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,680
And at the very last question,

525
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,840
three words that you would use

526
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,800
to describe yourself.

527
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,160
Three words. Okay.

528
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,520
That's a challenge.

529
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,600
So, I'm

530
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,560
a family woman.

531
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,560
I don't know if there is

532
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,160
such an expression,

533
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,640
I am a career woman.

534
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,360
And I am an entrepreneur.

535
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,040
I love it.

536
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,640
Nurit, thank you very much.

537
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,080
Toda raba.

538
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,480
This is really great.

539
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,120
And I look forward

540
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,800
to sharing this with the world.

541
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,760
Thank you.

542
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,560
Thank you so much.
