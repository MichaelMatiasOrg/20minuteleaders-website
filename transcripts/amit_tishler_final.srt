1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,840
You look at an animation show,

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,640
like a show

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,880
like a Cartoon Network and Adult Swim.

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,240
It takes the network about anywhere

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,200
between 500 to $700,000

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,120
per episode to produce,

7
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:14,343
and it takes a very long time.

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,400
Amit Tishler, thank you so much

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,160
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,280
Finally, it's an honor to have you.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,720
Yeah. Thank you so much.

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,320
Happy to be here.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,080
Animations, graphic design,

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,640
technology startups, gaming, you know,

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,880
we have so much to talk about

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,400
because I know nothing

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,240
about the work, the fascinating work

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
that you're doing.

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,600
Amit, first of all, who are you?

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,400
Because you're not just

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,960
the typical entrepreneur, are you?

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,440
Probably not.

23
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,800
The question, "Who are you?",

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,640
like man, that is a big one.

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,480
Am I really the one to define that?

26
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,840
It's philosophical.

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,360
Well, okay, let me try

28
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,080
and summarize the weird history

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,920
of my life, I suppose, or my career.

30
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,160
Please.

31
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,200
So, I actually started I think,

32
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,440
like you said, I'm not exactly

33
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,640
the boilerplate entrepreneur

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,800
in terms of my story

35
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,640
and my career progression.

36
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,440
I started off from a 2D animation.

37
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,000
So, I studied hand drawing animation.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,360
We're talking light tables, pencils.

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,760
That was the first medium

40
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,600
I've ever practiced in.

41
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
And I studied in Israel.

42
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,560
I'm originally from Tel Aviv.

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,680
I guess in that regard,

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,680
I am kind of like fitting

45
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,240
within the entrepreneur box.

46
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,040
Like I'm from Tel Aviv,

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,080
that's a good start.

48
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,840
And yeah, I studied 2D animation.

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,640
And in my first few years

50
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,680
I've worked in Israel,

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,720
just like in the industry

52
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,080
essentially gaining experience

53
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,560
in the field itself,

54
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,360
I was always that where

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,640
the spirit of entrepreneurship

56
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,800
was always there

57
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,440
is that I did always

58
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,400
want to do my own thing.

59
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,480
If anything, I think I can safely say

60
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,640
that I've been very opinionated

61
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,760
about my taste,

62
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,520
about how I think things should work,

63
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,720
whether on an industry level

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,480
or even in a granular narrative level.

65
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,040
And that really drove me forward.

66
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,560
Because one of my goals was

67
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,240
I realized, okay,

68
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,120
if I'm going to stay in Israel, sure,

69
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,920
I'll be able to continue working

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,320
but it's never going

71
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,480
to take me one step forward,

72
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,440
or one step beyond.

73
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,600
I always wanted to get more into--

74
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,400
The glass ceiling.

75
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:45,800
Exactly.

76
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,160
Kind of the glass ceiling of just,

77
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,680
you know, being outside of where

78
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,480
real entertainment kind of comes from

79
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,640
which is Los Angeles,

80
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,880
where I live in today.

81
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,040
And I knew that

82
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,560
I kind of had to be here

83
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,080
to really get things going.

84
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,320
Especially because a lot of my interest

85
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,800
was in developing original IP.

86
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,480
Now, another really bizarre thing,

87
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,280
or I don't know if it's that bizarre,

88
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,320
I'm a big fan of everything I like.

89
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,040
Like, I wear it on myself, like armor.

90
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,920
And I've always been a video game fan.

91
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,480
I also worked

92
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,680
as a videogame journalist

93
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,480
early on in my career,

94
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,600
ended up really drawing me back and forth

95
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,880
between work on software,

96
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,200
whether it's like educational

97
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,200
or game development, to TV animation.

98
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,800
So, I've always

99
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,560
kind of skipped between the two.

100
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,440
I moved to the States

101
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,280
at around 10 years ago.

102
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,240
And I did my master's here

103
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,680
and then moved to California

104
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,400
because I was like,

105
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,040
all right, if I want

106
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,720
to work in animation,

107
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,680
if I want to work in entertainment,

108
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,400
this is the place.

109
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,920
You've got to be here.

110
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,120
And fun fact, before you moved to the US,

111
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,440
you actually helped me compete

112
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,194
in a doodle for Google competition

113
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:54,462
for I think like,

114
00:03:54,463 --> 00:03:56,600
Israel's 60th anniversary.

115
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,480
And so, thank you

116
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,720
for taking the time to spend with

117
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,160
you know, my eight year old self.

118
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,080
I was amazed

119
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,920
that you remember that.

120
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,640
Of course I remember, because

121
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,960
I sent it in, and I don't know

122
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,400
if you even know,

123
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,560
I sent it as if I did it.

124
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,245
Totally fine.

125
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:12,710
I just sat next to you while you did it.

126
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,480
You have just documented

127
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,200
your crime, sir.

128
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,320
Exactly.

129
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,920
Amit, before we continue,

130
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,720
you're mentioning the animation space.

131
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,440
Graphic design space.

132
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
I know nothing about this.

133
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,640
Give me the three-minute crash course,

134
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,760
what is the animation space?

135
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,680
What is the supply chain look like?

136
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,600
What does an animator even do

137
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,560
in their day to day life?

138
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,160
That is a fantastic question,

139
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,320
and it's multilayered.

140
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,400
And it actually transitions really nicely

141
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,840
into how I started

142
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,480
my company, PopBase

143
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,720
with Lisa and Richard.

144
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,400
Perfect.

145
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:48,280
So basically, like, as an animator,

146
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,640
even though you are essentially

147
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,720
the craftsperson making the show

148
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,320
whether it's 3D animation

149
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,160
or 2D animation,

150
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,720
you are the one moving the character.

151
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,920
Animation is in the end, motion.

152
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,280
It's motion graphics.

153
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,320
It's more specifically,

154
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,320
let's say character based motion graphics

155
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,440
is the best way to kind of define it,

156
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,000
as opposed to just standard

157
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,960
like motion graphics

158
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,320
that are more graphic design based.

159
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,080
And in the end of the day,

160
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,360
this is a massive, massive industry

161
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,800
that is cross generational,

162
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,760
that's dealing with a lot

163
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,280
of creative IPs.

164
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,360
I think one of the things

165
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,200
that I've seen both fascinates

166
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,520
the tech industry

167
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,360
and also really confused

168
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,480
the tech industry

169
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,880
is A, entertainment seems to have

170
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,640
a really massive blind spot

171
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,560
when it comes down

172
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,120
to integrating technology, right,

173
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,200
Into its pipelines.

174
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,840
These are actually really old

175
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,120
programming pipelines.

176
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
As an animator, you come in

177
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,680
and you work within the studio system,

178
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:46,920
right?

179
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,840
So, by the time that you come in,

180
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,200
the process has already been through

181
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,040
you know, a show has been pitched.

182
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,600
That's your concept.

183
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,960
The show has been developed

184
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,920
and there are multiple steps

185
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,480
in the process

186
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,680
whether it went through a network

187
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,600
or studio system.

188
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,000
It actually gets incredibly complicated.

189
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,960
And then by the end of it,

190
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,200
when it actually gets greenlight

191
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,280
into production,

192
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,920
you're starting with pre-production.

193
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,560
You're bringing in your screenwriters,

194
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,160
then you're bringing in

195
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,440
your storyboard artist, your designers.

196
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,720
At some point,

197
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,440
while production is already running,

198
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,320
you have a channel

199
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,600
that it's going to be on

200
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,280
or you know what your distribution is.

201
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,040
At that point, the animator comes in,

202
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,760
you already have all

203
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,160
of your guidelines, right?

204
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,440
You're part of an animation team.

205
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,680
You're usually working hand to hand

206
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,360
with pre-production and post-production.

207
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,840
In the end,

208
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,640
the show appears on television.

209
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,760
That's as simple as that.

210
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,560
Right.

211
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,160
Right.

212
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,600
So, animators in many ways

213
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,760
are as creative as they are,

214
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,680
they are a cog in the machine

215
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,240
where the top of the hierarchy

216
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,920
are always the networks

217
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,960
because they are primarily

218
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,520
distribution channels.

219
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,320
But many times, not always,

220
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,000
they're also the IP owners.

221
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,160
So, when you think of

222
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,880
cross generational properties

223
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,240
like Star Wars, for example, right,

224
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,320
this is an intellectual property.

225
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,920
And once again, intellectual property

226
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,000
in the world of tech,

227
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,280
and I've seen this multiple times

228
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
when talking to because VCs,

229
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,760
it means something very different.

230
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,520
So, they're thinking of technological

231
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,960
intellectual property.

232
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,600
And when you're talking

233
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,560
about intellectual property in Hollywood,

234
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,280
very often or more often than not,

235
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
you are referring to something like

236
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,120
Star Wars, Spider-Man.

237
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,960
Like you're talking about

238
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,000
narrative driven intellectual properties.

239
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,080
And the amazing thing

240
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,400
about those intellectual properties

241
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,280
is that they very rarely,

242
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,200
if at all become irrelevant.

243
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,600
And that's what I mean

244
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,120
by cross generational.

245
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,680
And you can see

246
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,720
like Hollywood marketing

247
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,800
is very aware of that.

248
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,200
So, they make sure, now we're going

249
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
to create the Star Wars

250
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,440
for the younger generation.

251
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,120
Right.

252
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,840
And this goes all the way back

253
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,240
to even fairy tales. Right?

254
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,640
Stuff that is currently public domain.

255
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,280
Because stories are,

256
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,600
or good storytelling is immortal. Right?

257
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,400
So, in many ways,

258
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,720
if your intellectual property is a story

259
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,840
and it has characters,

260
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,600
and it's defined

261
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,200
by those certain parameters,

262
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,120
as long as you own it,

263
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,560
it is potentially immortal.

264
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,920
And it could be applied to games,

265
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,800
to television, to really any form

266
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,160
of entertainment.

267
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,760
And that's where the licensing business

268
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,200
in Hollywood comes from.

269
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,920
You're a developer,

270
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,320
you don't have

271
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,720
your own intellectual property,

272
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,520
but you say,

273
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,640
"Hey, you know what?

274
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,960
If I have the license for Spider-Man,

275
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,680
I can make an Amazing Spider-Man game

276
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,440
and I can monetize

277
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,760
the living hell out of it."

278
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,040
Well, if you have enough capital

279
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,120
to basically give to at this point,

280
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,760
Disney to license out the IP

281
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,720
and they approve it,

282
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,920
now you get to monetize

283
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,520
on their intellectual property.

284
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,046
Which means,

285
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,360
they get part of the revenue,

286
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,840
you get part of the revenue.

287
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,600
Still a standard licensing model.

288
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,240
But once again,

289
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,560
the thinking is really

290
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,600
all around the narrative.

291
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,040
Right?

292
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,680
Interesting.

293
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,760
Yeah, that's how they define

294
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,720
the intellectual property

295
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,240
that's of the highest value in Hollywood.

296
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
For me, I came from again,

297
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
from animation to IP development.

298
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,266
I started pitching

299
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:56,520
original IPs to networks.

300
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,880
I started selling and optioning shows

301
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,640
to TV networks

302
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,600
and getting in front of that pipeline.

303
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,560
And when you're there,

304
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,840
you get to see

305
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,520
A, what they're looking for;

306
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,280
and B, also what they're thinking about

307
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,120
in terms of how to immortalize

308
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,600
their own brands.

309
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,040
Because if you think of a TV network,

310
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,800
they can have like

311
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,600
a lot of different TV shows.

312
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,640
But in the end, they are trying,

313
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,000
if they're a good brand,

314
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,440
they're trying to define themselves.

315
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,000
Like we are the branded mix of

316
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,200
shows of this kind.

317
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,880
We're telling these kinds of stories.

318
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,720
We have a style, we have a,

319
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,840
Disney has been teaching everybody

320
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,320
how to do that

321
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,120
while incorporating other brands

322
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,240
underneath its umbrella.

323
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,560
Right?

324
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,360
They are basically the crown jewel

325
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,960
of the industry in that regard.

326
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,880
Both the crown jewel and the Death Star.

327
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,600
Right?

328
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,520
So, you can define it

329
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,480
whichever way you want.

330
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,760
But when we looked at that

331
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,000
we realized that one of the weaknesses,

332
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,880
and that goes all the way back to

333
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,040
Hollywood's weakness, like when it comes

334
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,520
to integrating new pipelines

335
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,040
or technology pipelines is that

336
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,880
everything is really siloed.

337
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,400
It is an incredibly siloed industry.

338
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,240
Their relationship,

339
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,040
their fascination with the industry

340
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,920
of like video games,

341
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,560
which is one of the fastest growing,

342
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,280
like branches of entertainment

343
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
currently out there,

344
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,000
has been, it kind of goes both ways

345
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,760
with the video game industry

346
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,000
obviously having an interest

347
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,920
in Hollywood's big IPs,

348
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,520
because that's what inspired a lot

349
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,920
of video game developers

350
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,240
to create what they're doing.

351
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,120
But also, Hollywood's like

352
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,160
fascination with anything that is

353
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
a little bit more sci-fi,

354
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,366
this is interactively,

355
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:37,000
know that it's the future

356
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,040
but they're also afraid of it

357
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,600
because they don't fully understand it.

358
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,720
And they don't know how to handle it.

359
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,800
Which was why a lot

360
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,040
of big businesses like

361
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,280
Universal and Disney,

362
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,240
even recently said that,

363
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,920
"We're not going to try

364
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,640
and develop our own things anymore.

365
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,400
We're just going to go

366
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,480
into a licensing model.

367
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,680
So, if you want to make games

368
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,480
based on our IPs,

369
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,280
just go right ahead."

370
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,120
I didn't know all this.

371
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,040
It's so interesting.

372
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,120
So, there's, and again,

373
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,200
this has been evolving over the years.

374
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,320
And it's been going back and forth.

375
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,640
Like if you think of Disney as an entity,

376
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,280
their department of Disney Interactive

377
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,640
has shut down and reopened about

378
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,240
like three or four times

379
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,640
in the last 10 to 15 years.

380
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,840
That's how fast this is moving

381
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,728
of how they just [--]

382
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:19,240
their new agenda is.

383
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,760
But what was very clear to us is that,

384
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,640
as a society

385
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,883
and I don't think that this is

386
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:25,960
a controversial statement

387
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,560
at this point,

388
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,800
we have a communication problem.

389
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,840
Right?

390
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
And it's whether you're trying

391
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,400
to educate people,

392
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,920
whether you're trying to entertain them,

393
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,640
whether you're trying to market to them,

394
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,000
or if you're just trying

395
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,200
to explain to people

396
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,720
that the world isn't flat

397
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,440
in the year 2020, for some reason.

398
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,783
You essentially have to have

399
00:11:45,784 --> 00:11:46,640
three key elements

400
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,680
in order to really cut

401
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,280
through the noise right now.

402
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,200
You need to have

403
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,200
the long and short form storytelling,

404
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,760
abilities of essentially Hollywood,

405
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,440
of shows of Netflix,

406
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,880
of streaming media.

407
00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:01,640
You need to have the interactivity

408
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,360
of video games

409
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,760
because that really enhances

410
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,160
knowledge retention.

411
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,840
And of course,

412
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,760
when you look at the younger generation,

413
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,160
this is one of the main forms

414
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,560
of communication they consume

415
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,360
in multiple different ways.

416
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,520
And you also need to have,

417
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,520
and this is really key,

418
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,880
you need to have the flexibility

419
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,360
and the speed of response

420
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,040
of social media. Right?

421
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,880
Yes.

422
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,080
A tweet comes out and exposes itself

423
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,960
to so many people,

424
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,200
so much faster than an entity,

425
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,360
even as powerful as Disney can respond.

426
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,160
Right?

427
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,440
So, it's so much easier

428
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,760
to get bad information out there

429
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,280
and much, much faster

430
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,640
than getting good vetted information

431
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,120
that is controlled by you

432
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,360
to your audience.

433
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,200
And part of it is just that pipeline.

434
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,840
If you think about creating

435
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,200
an animated show, right?

436
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,240
And this is where

437
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,280
my experience comes in in this company.

438
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,240
Because our entire agenda

439
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,880
and what our technology does

440
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,600
is take those three things. Right?

441
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,320
The fast, flexibility,

442
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,720
and response time of social media,

443
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
basically social media

444
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,160
marketing practices,

445
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,000
interactivity of video games

446
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,520
and the ability to tell

447
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,160
an ongoing linear story

448
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,440
take this three things,

449
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,640
kills them in one stone

450
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,240
and essentially build an infrastructure

451
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,640
that puts them all through one ecosystem.

452
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,560
Which is incredibly powerful

453
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,760
and has taken us years

454
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,000
to actually develop something

455
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,080
that can work.

456
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,240
But the idea is really to be able

457
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,160
to create a form of communication

458
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,560
that is sustainable,

459
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,200
that is future proof.

460
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,360
And we just believe that

461
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,440
it's kind of inevitable. Right?

462
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,520
I have to say, Amit,

463
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,960
you know, you were talking about

464
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,400
you know, PopBase

465
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,080
and the journey

466
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,000
that you've gone through.

467
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,440
And I have to say

468
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,720
that I've seen the product

469
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,800
and the way that you're describing it

470
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,160
as a communication tool

471
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,040
and future proof,

472
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,040
and that whole vertical

473
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,520
of this integrated communication that,

474
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,600
you know, is not really understandable

475
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,560
for somebody coming from, you know,

476
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,800
both from a different generation,

477
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,440
even I'm considering myself

478
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,880
as an older generation for this.

479
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,320
Because, you know,

480
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,920
I'm getting and producing information

481
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,440
very differently in the way that,

482
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,360
for example, my nieces do.

483
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,640
Right.

484
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,520
But I think the way you're doing

485
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,960
with PopBase is really fascinating.

486
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,440
And I'd love for you

487
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,040
to share with me a little bit about

488
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,800
what you're tangibly doing?

489
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,720
What is PopBase?

490
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,440
What is the technology

491
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:23,920
that you're building?

492
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,800
And what is the future

493
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,000
that you envision

494
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,160
with PopBase as an integral part

495
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,760
of every kid's, I guess daily routine,

496
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,520
as they go through learning

497
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,200
and developing habits?

498
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,640
That's a fantastic question.

499
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,400
So, let me try and give you

500
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,360
the aspirational part of the picture

501
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,640
that will maybe help illustrate

502
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,200
what it is we're aiming for.

503
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,440
So, if you can imagine,

504
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,640
let's say, a Netflix cartoon

505
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,960
and animated show,

506
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,560
they're also plays like

507
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,360
an open world video game,

508
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,960
like a Zelda, World of Warcraft,

509
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,040
but has the ability to update its content

510
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,120
and be as responsive

511
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,640
as a social media brand.

512
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,320
That's essentially the technology

513
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,480
that PopBase built.

514
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,000
It is a CMS.

515
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,240
So, it's a web portal

516
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,252
that allows us to control a creative IP

517
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:14,520
within an ecosystem on any screen.

518
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,200
Now, I'll illustrate that for you.

519
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,920
Right.

520
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,000
So, our go to market strategy right now,

521
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,600
we're basically,

522
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,520
we built this technology.

523
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,720
We're like, we know this works.

524
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,800
We know this is fantastic.

525
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,960
We know we can drive these

526
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,200
incredibly immersive

527
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,000
story driven experiences

528
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and really just control

529
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,520
a virtual world

530
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,520
through a live ops dashboard

531
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,480
in a way that isn't loose.

532
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,040
And what I mean by isn't loose,

533
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,000
it's not a creator platform.

534
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,200
Which is what a lot of the focus

535
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,960
of let's say, social media companies

536
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,040
have been currently like.

537
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,520
How do we make sure that anyone

538
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,720
can just tell any story.

539
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,600
Okay, but that is usually not the tool

540
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,240
that a large brand, let's say,

541
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,120
like Disney can use

542
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,280
in the same extent.

543
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,480
Right?

544
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
Sure, they can distribute stuff

545
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,280
on YouTube, now you're

546
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,120
on the same playing field

547
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,880
as everybody else.

548
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,200
It doesn't really

549
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,040
immerse you in the world,

550
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,640
it doesn't allow you

551
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,560
to control the whole thing.

552
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,280
You're still relying

553
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,640
on a separate ecosystem.

554
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,680
So, what we're doing is

555
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,760
that we're launching through

556
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,280
the wellness market. Right?

557
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,760
Which is a full of white space.

558
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,040
It's got like $575 billion

559
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,280
market right now

560
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,440
where most of the apps

561
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,160
that kids are given

562
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,960
are either mini games,

563
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,760
or they're kind of like

564
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,160
they have the Fitbit approach

565
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,880
of like I'm giving you

566
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,200
an interactive task list

567
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,080
that's gamefied.

568
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,280
But what is the problem?

569
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,680
I mean, what is the problem

570
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,640
of the wellness space?

571
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,960
Why is there so much money

572
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,560
that is being poured in?

573
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,640
You know, this is an extraordinary amount

574
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,320
of money that any startup

575
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,620
would love to say they're in,

576
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:42,840
a multi $100 billion space.

577
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,160
I would never imagine that

578
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,600
the wellness communication space

579
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,760
is that big.

580
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,640
What's going on there?

581
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,000
Look at where we live right now.

582
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,360
The times of covid.

583
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,560
And this is exactly

584
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,200
the point of why we're saying

585
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,880
we have a communication problem.

586
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,680
Right?

587
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,080
Where just the idea of teaching people,

588
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,040
"Hey, wear a mask when you go outside

589
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,320
because this is what happened.

590
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,720
Wash your hands."

591
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,160
Right?

592
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,000
Basic hygiene, basic safety.

593
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,040
Things that you think people should know

594
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,360
or should learn through schools

595
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,600
or should learn through, really anywhere.

596
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,440
But right now, when somebody like

597
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,240
if the FDA tweets something

598
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,840
and if the president tweets something

599
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,680
and if a troll tweets something,

600
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,160
it's flat.

601
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,560
It's the same amount of noise.

602
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,280
Right?

603
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,480
It's really hard for people

604
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,800
to source out what's real

605
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,560
and what's not.

606
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,120
They need something trusted.

607
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,920
Now for us, we're saying,

608
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,600
we're trying to get

609
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,040
to a generation that's early.

610
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,920
Like our go to market focus is

611
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,880
on children that are ages four to six.

612
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,480
And part of the idea is, well,

613
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,280
this is a generation that's growing

614
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,200
watching Netflix, scrubbing on Tiktok,

615
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,560
playing video games like Fortnight.

616
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,240
You can't give them interactive test

617
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,880
with apps or give them pamphlets

618
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,840
and expect them like, yeah,

619
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,560
they're going to retain this information.

620
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,440
If the teacher comes in and goes, like,

621
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,840
"Wash your hands, kids."

622
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,360
They're going to go,

623
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,719
"Hmmn, okay."

624
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,600
Who cares, right?

625
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,080
You can't do that.

626
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,760
But we come from entertainment.

627
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,200
And we know

628
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,680
that one of the most powerful things

629
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,440
you can do is

630
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,440
it has to come from intrinsic motivation.

631
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,000
Right?

632
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:18,600
So, you have to want

633
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,440
to engage with something

634
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,760
and learn from it.

635
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,400
So many people talk about how,

636
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,840
you know, a certain, let's say,

637
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,560
movie has made them feel something

638
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,720
or give them the power

639
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,520
to apply what they've learned from it.

640
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,840
It sounds kind of silly,

641
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,800
but it really isn't.

642
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,840
These are stories that inspire you.

643
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,640
And we want to create

644
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,680
an immersive experience

645
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,560
that is essentially speaking

646
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,680
their language because it's quick,

647
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,240
it's responsive, it's immersive,

648
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,120
it feels like you're going

649
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,320
into a magical world.

650
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,840
You don't know you're there to learn it.

651
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,160
It's more like Dora the Explorer,

652
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,240
or Sesame Street.

653
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,680
When you as a kid watch Sesame Street,

654
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,720
you don't think you're watching

655
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,040
something educational.

656
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,960
As an adult you go,

657
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,000
"Oh, okay, the count,

658
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,800
it's teaching me how to. Oh, I see."

659
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,080
But you don't think of that as a kid

660
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,120
because you're too busy

661
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,040
being in within the world

662
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,520
that entertained.

663
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,560
We're saying,

664
00:19:02,561 --> 00:19:04,680
we're creating a virtual world

665
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,160
where every feature is something

666
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,040
we can control

667
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,200
and change on a minute,

668
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,840
like on a moment's notice,

669
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,000
through our dashboard

670
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,320
in order to be able to respond

671
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,000
to how people behave with it.

672
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
In order to actually

673
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,640
talk directly to our audience

674
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,040
without even knowing

675
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,640
who each person is.

676
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,800
You think of Dora the Explorer.

677
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,960
They always have these segments

678
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,040
where you know,

679
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,880
and it's very sweet

680
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,200
and I get where it's coming from,

681
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,320
but it's also kind of awkward

682
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,720
that Dora kind of turns to the camera

683
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,480
and goes like,

684
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,240
"Well, kids, what do you think?"

685
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,200
Right.

686
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,520
Blank stare and I'm like...

687
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,800
You assume that they respond.

688
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,640
You pilot it, but you can't really

689
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,400
track something like that.

690
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,080
We're actually telling kids,

691
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,040
"No, you need to respond

692
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,440
and we'll know it." Right?

693
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,680
You're actually speaking

694
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,360
to the character

695
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,520
I think that I have to say, Amit,

696
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,240
one of the things

697
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,760
that I have to mention here,

698
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
because I think, you know,

699
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,200
on one hand creating content

700
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,160
that is interactive

701
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,440
and is producing the same effect

702
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,080
and it's incredible.

703
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,040
But building an infrastructure

704
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,200
that allows others to come

705
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,640
and modify that content

706
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,240
to fit their own specific needs, right,

707
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,800
every school wants to tell

708
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,400
their story a little bit different.

709
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,760
Every place that needs to teach

710
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,520
about how to deal with an earthquake

711
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,440
needs to learn a little bit

712
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,560
of a different situation,

713
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,920
different communication, you know.

714
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,200
We're looking at a globalized world.

715
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,520
We're still a million different cultures.

716
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,800
You know, even within the US,

717
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,880
we have different cultures

718
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,680
and different ways of communication.

719
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,640
And having a team of the animators,

720
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,760
building one product

721
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,120
with one communication

722
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,160
that targets all,

723
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,000
it just doesn't work,

724
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,400
especially not for kids.

725
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,440
And I think that what you're doing

726
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,840
with PopBase beyond

727
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,120
the actual, you know,

728
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,640
messaging of one game,

729
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,440
but actually building the infrastructure

730
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,520
that allows other creators to go

731
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,400
and modify that,

732
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,560
I think that's really

733
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,120
the innovative part here

734
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,320
that I as a technologist

735
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,800
and as a startup enthusiast,

736
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,760
I'm really excited about.

737
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,880
Yeah. Thank you.

738
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,040
And the interesting thing

739
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
is the way that we're thinking

740
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,200
about it, and again,

741
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,640
we'll see where

742
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,400
the market actually takes us.

743
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,960
But right now,

744
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,920
the way that we're launching

745
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,560
is that we're launching

746
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,640
our own original IP.

747
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,320
Because once again,

748
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,760
we're doing this kind of great value,

749
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,040
and we get to gather

750
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,440
our own team of experts

751
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,560
to say, we have a show runner,

752
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,000
an actual Hollywood show runner.

753
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,840
Like he's going

754
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,840
to help us dictate the content.

755
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,520
He's not going to rely on their knowledge.

756
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
But like you said,

757
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,320
he's going to work with schools,

758
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,760
he's going to work with hospitals

759
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,560
and essentially tell them like,

760
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,240
"A segment of our audience,

761
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,720
we want to give them this information.

762
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,080
Can we give this just to?"

763
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,720
Absolutely.

764
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,160
This system allows you to do that.

765
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,520
It allows you

766
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,840
to also distribute it publicly.

767
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,160
Now, what it also allows to do,

768
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,280
and that's what we're really hoping,

769
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,440
because that's the, let's say,

770
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,600
Woodland Mystery is the product

771
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,920
that we're launching on the system

772
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,400
as you know, it's a railway system.

773
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
And this is the first product

774
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,320
we've kind of tossing on it

775
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,160
because, again,

776
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,240
area full of white space,

777
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,560
it's a good way to break

778
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,240
into the market.

779
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,280
But what we're saying is,

780
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,440
okay, on one hand you can have

781
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,360
the $100 million business

782
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,320
of Woodland Mysterie's does really well.

783
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,240
And now, the kids

784
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,240
are growing out of it,

785
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,720
make your new IP. Right?

786
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,120
Make another one for kids

787
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,920
five to eight.

788
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,360
Make another one so kids grow up.

789
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:01,800
It's great.

790
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
We will be delighted.

791
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,440
That's like having

792
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,560
your own proprietary tool

793
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,600
that gives you that advantage.

794
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,720
The other thing you touched on,

795
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,960
that's the multibillion dollar business.

796
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,240
Right?

797
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,800
And it's something

798
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,160
that we're optimizing for,

799
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,000
which is the minute you put it out,

800
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,360
there are tool, doesn't only solve

801
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,440
the communication problem,

802
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,840
it's also it's a pipeline tool

803
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,120
that comes from, again,

804
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,840
thinking of animation.

805
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,197
Our founding team comes from,

806
00:22:23,198 --> 00:22:24,320
I come from television.

807
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,160
My CEO and CTO both come

808
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,120
from a long, long history

809
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,600
of video game development,

810
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,920
on both engineering

811
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,440
and the technical art side.

812
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,960
And that's where we really combine

813
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,760
our thinking with.

814
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,120
Like this is how Hollywood handles things

815
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,160
and this is how video games

816
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,760
handle things.

817
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,840
Just as a side note, video game,

818
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,080
the video game industry

819
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,080
has been so far ahead

820
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,840
on so many technologies.

821
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,560
And I think now

822
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,760
the tech world is starting

823
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,440
to catch up to it

824
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,200
because they're going like,

825
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,760
"Oh, my God,

826
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,720
why is this so successful?

827
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,040
How are they doing these things?"

828
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,080
In terms of R&D,

829
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,160
they are so far ahead,

830
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,280
you have no idea.

831
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,960
Like, I encourage you to look more

832
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,480
and more into the video game industry.

833
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,400
Because a lot of the tech companies

834
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,240
right now that are considered disruptive

835
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,600
really seem to them like primitive,

836
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,360
at this point. Right?

837
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,080
So, when you look at all of these pipelines,

838
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,800
we're essentially saying,

839
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,720
and this is an interesting

840
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,080
piece of information regardless,

841
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:19,320
but when you look at an animation show,

842
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,160
like a show like on Cartoon Network

843
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,000
on Adult Swim, it takes the network

844
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,680
about anywhere between 500 to $700,000

845
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,600
per episode to produce.

846
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,800
And it takes a very long time.

847
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,440
You think of the length

848
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,240
of a season on Netflix, it's like

849
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,080
eight episodes per season.

850
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,160
The traditional format

851
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,320
is more like 11 minutes,

852
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
20 episodes per season.

853
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,880
And it takes years

854
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,720
from when you actually

855
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,760
start pre-production to when you edit.

856
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,720
And even the production

857
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,240
of an episode itself takes months.

858
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,440
We essentially built a tool

859
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,280
that allows us

860
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,000
to distribute the same length

861
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,320
like a half hour, fully interactive,

862
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,880
fully immersive piece of content

863
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,960
in episode with a team of like

864
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,040
five to six people in two weeks.

865
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,920
So, going back

866
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,040
to what this model does,

867
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,440
if we put it out there

868
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,440
and it gets very quickly validated,

869
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,440
our hope is someone like a Disney,

870
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,200
like a Cartoon Network,

871
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,760
which we have worked with before,

872
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,562
looks at this and goes,

873
00:24:17,563 --> 00:24:19,280
"Wait a minute, you've done what?"

874
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,760
"Can I use that?"

875
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,880
Can I essentially use

876
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,200
my own intellectual property

877
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,720
to communicate my message?

878
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,240
It could be purely entertainment,

879
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,680
it could be education,

880
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,520
but I want to do this.

881
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,080
There you go.

882
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,000
Here's our API,

883
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,440
Here are our developer tools.

884
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,120
And here's all the documentation.

885
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,320
Now, you have the power

886
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,840
to do the same thing.

887
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,200
And that's what we're really hoping for

888
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,360
and that's what we're optimizing

889
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,840
the entire business around.

890
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,320
But, you know, it's a journey.

891
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,053
Amit, wonderful.

892
00:24:46,054 --> 00:24:48,000
And you know, beyond everything,

893
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,720
beyond the technology

894
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,880
and animation industry,

895
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,360
I think that the fact that

896
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,680
what you're working on really

897
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,280
at the end of the day,

898
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,600
it's in the wellness space.

899
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,400
And the positive impact

900
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:57,960
it's going to have

901
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,760
the butterfly effect

902
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,320
that it's going to have

903
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,440
is just tremendous.

904
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,080
That's what really

905
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,720
I'm excited about from the sidelines.

906
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,600
But it's a really amazing job.

907
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,760
And it's really, really inspiring

908
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,680
to get to know these new industries

909
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,080
and these new passions.

910
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,800
And watching somebody growing up

911
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,760
with a certain passion

912
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,240
and following it through,

913
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,360
both relocating

914
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,600
and moving through different journeys,

915
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,320
but now working on PopBase

916
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,760
for quite some time now

917
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,040
and being so passionate about it,

918
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,360
honestly, that's one

919
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,960
of the most inspiring things here.

920
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,120
Before we leave, I have to ask you

921
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,280
for the most important question,

922
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,560
which is three words

923
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,720
that you would use to describe yourself.

924
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,040
Okay. I would say determined,

925
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,120
I would say a direct,

926
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,280
I would say loud.

927
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,760
And you can interpret that

928
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,040
in any way you want.

929
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,240
I love all of those.

930
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:48,600
Amit, thank you so, so much.

931
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,240
Best of luck with PopBase.

932
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,560
And I can't wait to see

933
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,440
where this thing is going.

934
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,000
Thank you.

935
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,440
Thank you.
