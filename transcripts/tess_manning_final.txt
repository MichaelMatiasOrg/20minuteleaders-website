1 How can we create online programs that maybe aren't for full degrees but there's still a skills base, potentially certifications that have the branding that are recognized by employers. There needs to be a shift on the employer side to accept these new types of trainings. Tess Manning, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Good morning to you. Good evening to me. How are you? Thanks, Michael. I'm doing well. Great to be here. Appreciate the invitation. I'm very, very happy that you're here because we're going to talk about one of my favorite markets and industries that unfortunately, I don't know nearly enough as much as I should, which is the education space. And you have a really fascinating trajectory all the way from working at a company like Pluralsight, which I have used and many of my friends use all the way to now being a principal at the GSV Ventures and really focusing on the education sector more deeply. But in between, there were some other really incredible things. Like doing an MBA at Stanford, helping teach classes at Stanford. And we have to get started with your fun fact, which is the fact that, you know, your a dancer at heart and you actually taught some hip hop and dance to some people at Stanford and in the VC space. That's right. So, while I was at GSV, I was teaching, a what turned into a weekly hip hop dance class with one of my classmates to all of our classmates starting our first year. We have it at the end of the year musical that is essentially a parody of the GSP. And we rope in a lot of people to perform that year. A lot of women and men who had never danced before found out they had love and passion for dance in their late 20s, early 30s, because I was really inspired by that. And so, my classmate and I started actually teaching around the bay. And I think my favorite story is that Heidi Roizen at Threshold Ventures came to class, found out what we were doing, and she organized a group of women and a few men. And we taught them a full three minute dance over the course of eight weeks and had a final performance at the threshold office. Which was incredible. Unbelievable. So, Tess, walk me a little bit through your journey. Why education? Why Stanford MBA? What's going on over there? Yes. It's been an interesting journey. So, I started my startup journey in New York. I had worked at a number of startups over the course of seven years before moving to out to the West Coast for GSV. The first startup I actually worked at was during college. I was an intern at one of the first companies that was part of the first cohort of TechStars in New York, and they were an education technology company. And this was back in 2011. And their vision was to democratize access to your knowledge on the web and to help people learn, adult learners learn new topics in a fun way. That really resonated with me because I was really passionate about economic development and helping people all over the world find opportunities, which I think a lot of people have a similar mission when they're in college. But this really felt like a viable way to do that. So, I was really excited about the power of technology and in spreading education. I had a few different companies that I worked at before coming back full circle to ed tech. I had worked at two other startups in New York that were both fast growth, learned kind of the ins and outs of lots of different functions from sales and account management to product, people operations, recruiting, really the full gamut, aside from actually programming and designing and fell in love with working with early stage startups. So, right before I came to the GSV, I worked at a startup called Andela, which at the time was a tiny talent accelerator focused on high potential young people in Nigeria. And we were giving them six months of full stack training for free and then helping place them with long term roles as distributed engineers. Really inspiring, life changing for them, for us, for the teams that they worked with all over the world. Really demonstrated the power of diverse teams and it was just an incredible win-win all around and commercially viable as well. So, that startup now, you know, there are over 2,000 engineers, in series company, really incredible. And so I was excited about that business model. So, coming to the GSV, I knew I wanted to stay in ed tech and workforce development. So, my summer at Pluralsight, right after that IPO-ed. And then coming out of the GSV, I had to make that decision of going back to an early stage company, or as fate will have it, found out that GSV Ventures, which is an ed tech venture fund that focuses on early stage founders, was hiring in tandem with growing their second fund. And so, the stars kind of aligned and turns out Andela and Pluralsight were both GSV portfolio companies and it felt like the right next step. So, I've been here for about a year now. That's remarkable. First of all, it sounds like over the course of your career, I mean, it's a formal career as you summarize it. So, it's huge and impressive but you know, it sounds like in retrospect, it's pretty easy to draw the dots and to see this linear curve. But was it a linear career? Did you imagine when you were in Africa that you're going to be in Pluralsights to the GSB, to GSV? What was going on there? No. Absolutely not. I mean, it's hilarious. When I look at the resumes of all my classmates at the GSB and compare them with mine, you know that, so many of them have stories that they were making kind of very conscious, calculated decisions every step of the way, and then they got to GSB and were like, oh, my God, what now. So, I've always been a bit like, oh my God, what now? And then once I got to GSB, I actually had more clarity when I was here on what I wanted to do. So coming in, I mean, I might have been one of the only people that stuck to what I wrote in my essay. I wrote that I wanted to help education technology companies find viable business models. Because historically, it's been very difficult. Right? And you can even see that on the funding landscape, on the number of public companies in ed tech, the number of growth companies, and that's all changing especially this year, right, which is great. But at the time, that was something I really wanted to focus on and what I did coming at the other end. But getting there, yes, like crazy journey. I worked at a marketing software startup, I worked at Timehop, the social media nostalgia app. Were it's like, all over the place really, and all kinds of functions. But, you know, I think every step along the way, I knew it deep in my knowledge that I wanted to remain in tech. I love working closely with engineers and building products and with early stage founders. So, it was really concrete in that area. And then as time went on, I realized that I was most inspired by working at a company with a strong mission. And so, the decision, for instance, to work at Pluralsight, was part of that. I wanted to become more of a sector expert. I wanted to understand what it was like at a later stage company in the tech sector and how the businesses differ there. So, sort of, longer than that but that's the gist of it in a way. I have to learn a little bit about the education sector in order to really grasp what you're doing in the GSV and where your passion lies. Because it sounds like you fell in love with ed tech. And with finding a balance between the right business model to a high impact opportunity to really help people, obviously, through your experience with Africa. But it sounds like it's deeper than that. Talk to me a little bit about this dissonance between finding a good business model for a high impact or social good company. Sure. So, to take a step back, looking at this problem through the lens of how we make investments at GSV, first and foremost, we always say that the greatest returns on the fund will come from the companies with the greatest impact and return on education. Right? And so, these are the companies that are going to reach the largest number of learners or they will be lowering the cost of education, right, resulting in being able to access more learners. And they're having their strong efficacy with whatever product or service that they're offering. So, improves outcomes for education. So, we're looking at companies through those lens when we're making a decision on whether or not we'll invest in them. So, what that ends up when you're looking at very, very early stage companies and trying to decide what's going to last, what's going to be a sustainable model, what will do all of those things or a combination of them is something that, you know, the models have changed a lot in ed tech. So, I think in the early days in K-12, there are a lot of companies that were trying to sell directly to schools. Fast forward today, you see a lot of different creative models where someone like, you know, a class dojo is free for a number of years and built up this enormous base of teachers that were absolutely obsessed with their product and it was their lifeblood for communication outside of the classroom with parents and students. And then they flipped on monetization last year. And then, you know, so, that's more of a direct to consumer model in a way, even though it's in the classroom. And so they don't have to worry about these really long institutional school sales cycles where there's only a limited number of essentially government dollars that they're fighting over. So, companies of today in ed tech and on K-12 and higher ed, for instance, are trying to come up with more creative models. And things like Course Hero, for instance, is a Chegg competitor and they are a marketplace to student resources. So, once again, going straight to the learner versus going and creating a university partnership. On the enterprise learning side, there is something I believe in for a long time that adult learners, that cost of learning, yes, there is always going to be an individual cost as life goes on. But the reality of today is that we are all going to need to become lifelong learners. Whether you understand that now or not, we're going to constantly need new skills, we are going to constantly be changing jobs. And probably, working longer than any other moment in history. And so, I would like to see in and there is a belief and understanding now that companies should take on a lot of that cost of retraining their employees over time as well. So, there are a lot of business models now focused on having the company pay for their employees education. Whether that's in-house, because they're going to stay or like a Pluralsight, for instance, or Coursera, or it could be someone like Guild Education that's paying for their front line workers to earn college degrees or skill certificates, which is pretty incredible. And those employees, they know will be leaving. Yeah. So, a few thoughts there. I just had a fascinating class at the Graduate School of Engineering a Product Management class were actually we were working with Target and I was the only Stanford student there. We had somebody from Amazon, from Microsoft, from Google. And because they were coming in for external training to do to shift their priorities within the company, that I believe some of them were moving from engineering to product management. And all of a sudden, I find myself working with people that are 10, 15 years older. They have all sorts of different experiences and that combined learning. I think obviously, I'm getting much more excited and emotional when I think of companies that are doing it for the frontline workers to get college degrees and something like that. But it really looks like the world is changing to what you were saying. What are some bigger problems that we are still thinking of today in terms of education, whether it's accessibility, it's information dissemination. What are some of those big picture things that we still haven't figured out? Yeah. Great question. Also, love that story. I think that another thing, just as a quick aside, that I think will be huge is how do we bring together learners of different ages. And when you think about adult learning, age has been such a construct in the past. And really, like a lot of companies, are experimenting with adult learning by creating cohorts of different age learners. So, I love that idea. So, the, sorry, I just lost track of the question now. The bigger question. Yes. It's because you're so passionate about these ideas. Or just you know, rambling on. So, a couple of things, though. I mean, when you look at the US, for instance, our levels of literacy and numeracy for college graduates have not been improving over the last, like 25 years. The actual graduation levels have been improving. Right? And so, there's been a huge focus in the US over the past few, let's say, presidencies to increase graduation rates or not. About 88% national level. But there are, you know, the actual outcomes of high school education are not there. So, when you're thinking about what problems need to be solved, that's an enormous one is the actual efficacy of education and outcomes there. It's really hard to change the curriculum and to change the system. But the US education levels are falling behind many other countries in the world. And so, if we're thinking about something domestic, that's definitely a huge issue. And then, of course, that problem applies to any potentially like emerging country as well. We're used to having an enormous number of learners and so, you are obviously not going to have the right number of teachers that are able to see drive those outcomes either potentially. So, that's a big one for sure. The other one in higher education, we're going to be over doubling the number of college age students in the next 10 to 15 years. And there just aren't enough institutions in the world that have the capacity to educate the number of college age students. That's an enormous problem. By the way, why is that happening? The world population growth. They're just going to be an enormous number of people of that age level. And so, in terms of traditional institutions, you know, you can't spend up a college overnight. You can't, you know, when you think about things like accreditation, which is a huge obstacle in higher ed innovation in the US so, making sure that students are getting credit for the courses that they're taking, you know, a ton of hurdles there. It is an archaic system that stifles a lot of innovation. But then, you know, and then internationally, same issue. So, one thing that we need to deal with and think ahead for which companies like Coursera and others are doing is how can we create online programs that maybe aren't for full degrees, but there's still a skills base, potentially certifications that have the branding that are recognized by employers. There needs to be a shift from the employer side to accept these new types of trainings. And we need to find a way to educate that group of college, "traditionally college age learners" coming down the road. And then the enterprise, I think I've mentioned it already. But just thinking about how do you map the skills within your organization, understand the gaps and then help up and up and reskill, which is there's a lot, a lot of like hot conversation around right now and everyone knows they need to do it. But actually figuring it out is very difficult. Especially in roles that aren't, you know, that have more of an emphasis on soft skills or things that are historically hard to measure. It's tough to figure out how to handle those. Tess, I have to say that, you know, I've done quite a few of these episodes. One of the things that inspires me most across these episodes is when I meet people that are just truly passionate and curious about what they're doing. That their positions there and it's not just because it was a cool opportunity and just a nice jumpstart. But really, they're following this trajectory of following their passion, following their curiosity. It's something that I live by and that I've become more and more inspired through this show that the people that are really making a difference are those that they are truly following their passions. And things don't become easy, but they become doable and they become energized. And I'm learning so much just from this short 20 minute conversation. Tell me a little bit about the Girl Develop It. You are on the advisory board there. What are you doing over there and what is sort of the mission? Because it sounds really phenomenal. Yes, Girl Developer It is a nonprofit that's been around for a long time now, almost 10 years. And they've reached over 100,000 adult learners, primarily women. They provide free or low cost introductory level courses in programming topics, and they've expanded a bit more to things like digital marketing and a few others. But it's really incredible. I mean, the goal is to create an environment where adult learners, it was intended originally for women, but it's really open to anyone, can learn in a judgment free space. You know, If they have been stuck in and maybe just a pretty average role for the last 10, 15, 20 years. Maybe they have a degree, maybe they don't. I mean, really, we have learners of all ages. They can come to Girl Development. They can say, I'm curious about unity development, I'm curious about dev ops, I'm curious about JavaScript, Maybe I heard about it on a podcast, maybe I heard about it from a friend, but I have no idea where to even start. I'm embarrassed. I don't even know the right questions to ask. And they can come and take a course and then start to create a new career trajectory from there. So, really incredible. There are volunteer instructors who are also paid time for teaching the classes. And yeah, it's really just an amazing, amazing non-profit and it's really fun story how I got involved. I met an entrepreneur named Brenda Jin in January last year. So, we've only known each other or about a year. It wasn't the right fit for an investment, but her and I really hit it off and have become kind of thought partners and friends. And so, she asked me to get involved this summer. And it's been a blast. We had a mini conference. We got Unity involved, the teacher in course sponsor it. And Unity's a partner of GSVs. So, it's just amazing to see how the education ecosystem, everybody really plays together and supports one another. Tess, it sounds phenomenal. I thank you for all the work that you're doing, both with the GSV, but also on these advisory roles. And for teaching dance. I'm still owe to take, to take the social dance class that I'm supposed to. One day, hopefully I would get in touch with Philly as well at the GSV. But for now I'll do the social dance class. Tess, three words that you would use to describe yourself. And thank you for being so generous with your time here. Sure, great question. This is very difficult. So, I mean, I think that two the two more obvious ones, if you will, I would say, number one is optimistic. That's just for better or for worse, part of my DNA. Yeah. I think that's anyone that's working in an early stage startup, anyone that's just constantly trying new things like you kind of have to be and you want to see things come to life. And yes, that's a big one. And then, I hear this one a lot. So, I guess I could say it's maybe not self described, but energetic. So, really, like, I try to bring energy to everything I do. But it's true. It's something I realized over time, and the longer and longer you're in the workforce and then, you know, maybe increasingly difficult roles or more responsibility, etc. like the energy you put out into the world is how you're going to see that's going to reflect on others and really kind of change the mood of a team you're working on. And endure oneself, that's something I focus on a lot. And then, I guess the last one would be maybe somewhere around, so, I used to also teach kids creative movement in shelters in New York for nine years of another nonprofit. So, dance, but it's more creative movement. And I kind of love this idea, of not just exactly creativity, but something around like creativity, fluidity, where, you know, no matter what's coming at you, you're able to kind of make something out of it and feel something from it, adapt, like something along the lines of that. And so, maybe it's more of a, like a dance move. You're like living with a dance move. Some concepts around there. I love that. I attribute a lot of my optimism and my, you know, the fact that I am energized whenever something changes or whenever I'm tackling a challenge to the fact that I participated in a lot of high school musicals when I was back in high school. That was one of my favorite hobbies. Because it was all about interchanging ideas. And then, you know, and then, the bridge would fall from the stage, because somebody pushed it by accident then you have to now respond to it and have fun with it. Exactly. So, I attribute a lot of that to that. Tess, Thank you so, so much. This was wonderful. Thank you for the Inspiration. It was great. Thank you Michael. That's awesome. And one day we'll put together a musical in our staff together. 100%.
