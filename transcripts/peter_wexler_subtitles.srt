1
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,280
Peter Wexler, thank you

2
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,400
for being on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,320
How are you?

4
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,520
Oh, I'm doing great, Michael.

5
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,680
Thanks very much.

6
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,600
Where are you calling from right now?

7
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,880
I'm calling from my covid pandemic

8
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,520
office hideout in downtown Palo Alto.

9
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,040
Wonderful.

10
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,680
So, we're neighbors.

11
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,080
I'm right here on Forest Avenue at Hippo.

12
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,560
But it's really really great to have you.

13
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,160
And I'm really excited

14
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,000
to talk to you about teamwork.

15
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,720
You've been a part of numerous teams

16
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,000
in various positions.

17
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,280
Both on the end of the company

18
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,600
as VP of Engineering.

19
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,280
And really internally

20
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,920
and seeing through acquisitions,

21
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,040
joining huge companies.

22
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,880
You mentioned Siemens

23
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,320
of over 400,000 people internationally.

24
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,960
And on the other side also,

25
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,640
being a board member on various companies.

26
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
It sounds like

27
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,880
a different type of teamwork.

28
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,960
I'd love to learn about both experiences.

29
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,280
And I'd love to explore with you

30
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,920
over these next 19 minutes or so

31
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,880
what makes a team strong.

32
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,640
What makes the team, perhaps,

33
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,280
weaker than the others.

34
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,120
So, take me along your journey, Peter.

35
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,040
Let's start from the beginning.

36
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,120
Walk me a little bit about

37
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,600
where you come from,

38
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,960
and your insight into teamwork.

39
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,240
Let's see.

40
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,560
Undergraduate electrical engineering.

41
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,960
I was always interested in that stuff

42
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,840
when I was a kid.

43
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,640
Science, engineering,

44
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,560
ham radio, all that stuff.

45
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,240
And actually through that,

46
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,520
I had a strong interest

47
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,720
in biology as well.

48
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,600
So, I ended up getting a graduate degree

49
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,680
in biomedical engineering.

50
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,040
Imaging of the retina,

51
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,160
and a lot of image processing,

52
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,280
which was great.

53
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,800
And I worked in that field.

54
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,160
I actually worked for an Israeli company

55
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,800
called Elscint in the early days,

56
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,520
which was a pioneer

57
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,640
in nuclear medicine and ultrasound.

58
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,840
But for a whole variety of reasons,

59
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,720
I ended up in the networking field

60
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,800
very early on.

61
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,280
Before there was the Web.

62
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,960
Before there was anything else.

63
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,280
And I've actually spent

64
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,120
a fair time of my career

65
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,720
in the networking space,

66
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,760
both for large companies,

67
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,160
but also, with some

68
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,880
very early stage companies.

69
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,240
From zero, from maybe 15 people.

70
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
And for the whole issue of teamwork,

71
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,640
one of the ones I like to focus on

72
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,440
is Juniper Networks.

73
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,040
So, Juniper Networks,

74
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,480
which is one of the major players

75
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,360
with the infrastructure

76
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,960
that's in the Internet,

77
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,480
I was the first VP of engineering.

78
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,360
I started maybe

79
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,320
when there were 15 or 17 people.

80
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,800
Oh, wow. Okay.

81
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,320
And there are a number of reasons why,

82
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,720
and when we ran the company,

83
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,360
we ultimately had

84
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,640
675 people in engineering.

85
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,800
And we were half a billion dollars

86
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,120
by the time I moved on.

87
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,120
But a lot of lessons that I learned there

88
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,440
from the folks I worked with.

89
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,880
And so, the first thing was

90
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,960
when you're building a team,

91
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,120
in addition to the key technical skills

92
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,520
that you're looking for,

93
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,720
you have to look at the

94
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,480
how people play together.

95
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,640
And how is an individual going to be

96
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,080
as part of a team.

97
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,520
Because it's not about, these days,

98
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,280
one individual can't do the whole thing.

99
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,120
Especially when you're doing

100
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,680
complex things.

101
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,240
The thing I'd mention to you, Michael,

102
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,520
I like to say,

103
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,360
any given day is the best thing

104
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,520
you've ever done in your life,

105
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,960
or the worst thing you've ever done

106
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,080
in your life.

107
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,760
And I like to say, the average

108
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,360
just needs to be above zero.

109
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:40,680
Right.

110
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,560
And then it's a good thing.

111
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,480
So, one of the things

112
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,000
that we did at Juniper was,

113
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,560
we were have very extensive process

114
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,440
during the interview.

115
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,600
And it wasn't so much,

116
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
yeah, there were technical reviews

117
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,960
and that sort of thing.

118
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,160
But it was really,

119
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,440
a group of folks trying to understand

120
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,080
the personality of the individual

121
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,120
and how they would fit within the team.

122
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,680
Which is not to say you want everybody

123
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,400
to look the same

124
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,080
because people looked way different.

125
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,240
There are a lot of different people.

126
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,720
But it's like how would they play

127
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,520
as part of the team.

128
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,840
Because when challenges happen,

129
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,520
you need to be able to solve them

130
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,240
in a really constructive way.

131
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,080
And on the other hand,

132
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,760
when wonderful things happen,

133
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,640
there's nobody better to celebrate with

134
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,240
than folks who are focused

135
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,680
on the same goal.

136
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,960
And so, at one level,

137
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,840
in terms of building a company,

138
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,920
that's teamwork.

139
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,560
You mentioned boards.

140
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,400
And that's a lesson

141
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,280
that I actually learned the hard way.

142
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,360
There was a well-funded company

143
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,520
that I was asked to join.

144
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,400
It was maybe about 20 people.

145
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,800
I came in to help sort out engineering.

146
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,160
And it had the reputation

147
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,760
of the individuals on the board

148
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,040
was all stellar, but unfortunately,

149
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,240
too many egos in the room.

150
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,760
Folks did not play well together.

151
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,520
And again,

152
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,640
when there were some tough times

153
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,600
and some tough decisions had to be made,

154
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,480
the team was incapable

155
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,480
of making out decisions.

156
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,280
So, its a group of board members

157
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,920
that are each individually are stellar,

158
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,560
but coming in together don't seem to find

159
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,000
the unity and the harmony

160
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,480
to come up with good results.

161
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,480
Actually this reminds me

162
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,000
of a beautiful quote

163
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,240
that [--],

164
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,320
also from Jay Venturers,

165
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,120
mentioned to me just a few days ago

166
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,440
in our call, he said,

167
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,920
"If you want to be a good leader,

168
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,040
learn to check your ego at the door."

169
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,880
And I just loved that imagery

170
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,760
of checking the ego at the door

171
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,320
and walking in and he referred that

172
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,560
as to the whole J-Venture's mantra.

173
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,160
That we come in

174
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,920
and we have one hundred people

175
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,800
in the room looking at deals

176
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,480
and every person feels that,

177
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,080
while they can contribute,

178
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,280
they also have so much to learn

179
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,920
from everybody else.

180
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,000
I think that's exactly right.

181
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,440
The other piece is,

182
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,920
the other thing is,

183
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,520
if you're hiring the best people you can,

184
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,320
what you find is

185
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,960
your hiring type A people.

186
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,400
Now, it's like an arranged marriage.

187
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,080
There's no reason it should work.

188
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,600
You're slamming all these people together.

189
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,640
Everybody has success.

190
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,960
Everybody's got an ego.

191
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
It won't work.

192
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,840
So, your job as a leader

193
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,280
is to basically keep the thing

194
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,200
from going off the rails, till you get to

195
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,640
whatever milestone is important.

196
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,040
Now, having said that,

197
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,640
everybody who's going to come in

198
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,360
is not going to be even keeled.

199
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,880
And that's not what you want.

200
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,720
So, the trick is, I always say

201
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,440
I give you more latitude

202
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,080
in terms of your enthusiasm.

203
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,240
Based upon how much

204
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,280
of a contributor you are

205
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,640
and how you help the rest of the team.

206
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,520
So, every so often

207
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,240
people have a meltdown or whatever else.

208
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,600
But if they're good contributors

209
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,560
and they're working well, we understand.

210
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,000
And frankly, teams understand that,

211
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,400
Even the small team, everybody knows

212
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,680
how much everybody is contributing.

213
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,600
And everybody gives everybody a break

214
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,840
if people are contributing.

215
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,320
So, you're not going to get people

216
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,360
who are uniform and smiley and wonderful.

217
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,920
Everybody is going to be very intense

218
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,720
because they believe.

219
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,600
But, like Andy Grove used to say,

220
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,840
You decide and commit.

221
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,560
Which is, we can be passionate

222
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,720
about our discussions.

223
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,240
And we got to get it on the table.

224
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,640
But once we decide on the direction,

225
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,000
we got to move forward.

226
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,360
Because if we keep going,

227
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,560
even if it's small steps,

228
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,120
moving forward is key.

229
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,360
And so, how do you facilitate

230
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,320
that moving forward mantra,

231
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,680
especially as you're working

232
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,800
on these various companies?

233
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,720
All of them are critical infrastructure.

234
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,520
A lot of these are, perhaps,

235
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,680
longer term projects

236
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,240
that you don't celebrate every day

237
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,000
and you don't see progression every day.

238
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,560
So, as a team leader,

239
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,440
how can I continue to motivate a team,

240
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,960
and to continue that mindset

241
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,200
of moving forward and making decisions

242
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,040
where keeping everybody passionate,

243
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,680
if we're looking at long term

244
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,760
commitments and not short term goals?

245
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,200
So, one of the things that is important

246
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,480
is transparency, right?

247
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,200
Which doesn't mean

248
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,000
everything's on the table.

249
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,360
But being transparent because,

250
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,480
particularly when things

251
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,480
get a little bit of tough,

252
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,240
that's when conspiracy theories start.

253
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,160
I don't know if it's engineers,

254
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,920
or it's the same with biologists,

255
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,640
or whatever,

256
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,920
but if something's not going right

257
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,800
or they see that you're worried,

258
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,040
absolutely the worst thing

259
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,840
that's possible would be dreamt up, right?

260
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,280
And certainly not the case.

261
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,880
So, keep a check.

262
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,160
I forget who said it was,

263
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,640
The leader has a long tail.

264
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,720
So, you better be careful

265
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,960
how you swing that thing.

266
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,840
So, you need to be transparent

267
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,560
about what's going on.

268
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,600
And a lot of times,

269
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,560
there's a lot of moving parts

270
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,760
in these businesses.

271
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,800
And people don't always have a background

272
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,400
or an understanding or the experience.

273
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,280
And you need to be able to translate

274
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,120
and explain to folks what the context is.

275
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,320
We're going out.

276
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,040
We're raising money.

277
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,520
It's taking a longer time.

278
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,680
We actually had to raise

279
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,800
the second round of funding

280
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,280
for a company we started

281
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,240
during the recession.

282
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,200
Took twice as long that it was before.

283
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,480
Everybody got a little bit worried.

284
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,480
But you need to explain what's going on.

285
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,280
Don't leave things in mystery.

286
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,560
And it's just all about

287
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,760
helping people feel comfortable.

288
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,000
And you do it one on one.

289
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,240
Or you do it with a group.

290
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,000
And hiding things is not good.

291
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,960
Being transparent where you can,

292
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,880
and helping to put things in context

293
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,840
is important.

294
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,160
And that's, frankly,

295
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,160
if you have a good board for a company.

296
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,760
Bringing in a board member or two

297
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,760
who has a very good perspective

298
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,840
and having that person

299
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,560
sit with the company,

300
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,200
so, you're not the only person.

301
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,040
It's not like you're just

302
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,880
melding platitudes.

303
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,560
You're bringing in some other folks

304
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,720
who've got some perspective

305
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,840
who can help folks.

306
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,760
So, Peter, it sounds like

307
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,960
a lot of this foundation

308
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,280
is built upon respect, open mindedness,

309
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,240
along with this idea

310
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,680
of contributing to the team

311
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,800
and being a team player.

312
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,520
Talk to me a little bit

313
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,040
about this idea of respect.

314
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,200
How do you facilitate respect?

315
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,000
And then the next question would be

316
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,600
open mindedness within a team.

317
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,080
Because at the end,

318
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,360
the team is not just

319
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,800
performance based team

320
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,480
where you just you check off goals.

321
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,760
What you're talking about here

322
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,800
is that every person

323
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,600
needs to be contributing.

324
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,720
You need to come in unison

325
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,160
and complement each other.

326
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,360
And to me, it sounds that

327
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,040
a fundamental aspect of this

328
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,040
is the respect, right?

329
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,080
It's important.

330
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,760
And there's respect

331
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,920
in different dimensions, right?

332
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,040
Technical respect,

333
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:35,160
human respect, etc, etc.

334
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,560
Culture starts from the top.

335
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,560
And actually, we see this

336
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,040
in some companies in Silicon Valley

337
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,480
that have been written about.

338
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,640
They say that, it's like the fish

339
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,120
it rots from the head.

340
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,400
So, not my words, but others.

341
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,720
But it's true.

342
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,600
So, it's the environment

343
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,400
that you establish from the beginning.

344
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,320
And also, it's how you treat.

345
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,040
There are going to be people who,

346
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,800
while they may be great contributors

347
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,320
and be required to be around

348
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,520
for a certain period of time,

349
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,680
as the company grows,

350
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,240
it just may not be a good fit.

351
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,320
And frankly, you need to deal with those

352
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,000
and take action.

353
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,880
Because if you don't,

354
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,880
it's everybody recognizes

355
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,240
that you're not taking action

356
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,040
and you tolerate that behavior.

357
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,400
So, you've got to set the culture

358
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,200
from the beginning.

359
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,240
It's how you behave.

360
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,960
How you expect the team to behave.

361
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,160
When things go off the rails,

362
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,400
how you deal with them.

363
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,960
So, that's crisis management.

364
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,840
When things go off the rails,

365
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,800
how do you deal with them.

366
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,720
Are there personal experiences

367
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,960
that you've had, or any key moments

368
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,080
that you've observed where you saw

369
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,800
either people come on top,

370
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,120
or not succeed through these crisis?

371
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,000
I have had situations where things

372
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
have been brought to a head

373
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,160
because of certain individuals.

374
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,320
And so, if a particular individual

375
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,720
is problematic in a number

376
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,680
of different dimensions,

377
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,720
not so much because they're not technical,

378
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,680
but because it's their behavior

379
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,160
and how they create dysfunction

380
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,240
throughout the group.

381
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,280
So, I spent a lot of time

382
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,760
walking through parking lots with people.

383
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,040
As groups grew,

384
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,520
I started to ask myself,

385
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,400
"What do you contribute

386
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,200
to this technically?"

387
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Because I felt more like

388
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,760
I was being a psychologist

389
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,840
or psychiatrist.

390
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,160
That's hilarious.

391
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
The office is open.

392
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,240
People come in, shut the door.

393
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,200
The next guy comes and shuts the door.

394
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,800
So, and too many times

395
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,000
walking around the parking lot.

396
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,680
And with some of that one on one,

397
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,360
you could smooth it.

398
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,800
But it gets to a point where you can't.

399
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,520
The hope is that you,

400
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,200
it's particularly tough with small teams

401
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,240
because everybody's critical.

402
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,440
But when you start to see this,

403
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,240
or get wind of this,

404
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,360
then you need to start

405
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,400
a long term strategy of saying,

406
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,480
"I think in the long run,

407
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,400
this person is not going to work out."

408
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,880
What am I going to do?

409
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,720
Because at some point

410
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,800
this person's going to have to go.

411
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,840
And how do I prepare other

412
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,040
folks to take on things.

413
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,280
How do I bring other people in.

414
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,160
And then, you ultimately

415
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,520
need to take action.

416
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,080
Now, having said that, most of the cases

417
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,960
don't involve ejecting a person, right?

418
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,520
It involves working with people

419
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,960
individually, one on one,

420
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,080
about how they can grow

421
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,080
and be more effective.

422
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,800
They usually don't want

423
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,760
to be a bad person.

424
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,040
They, a lot of times,

425
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,120
somebody will have experience

426
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,200
in a previous company

427
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,360
an style of behavior

428
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,760
that worked well for them.

429
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,080
Right.

430
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,600
And it's a matter of helping them grow

431
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,200
and learn that there are other ways

432
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,600
to get things done.

433
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,480
And in many cases, actually this works.

434
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,440
It's just, bad behavior that maybe,

435
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,000
especially if somebody

436
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,800
hasn't worked for 20 years, right?

437
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,520
If they're younger,

438
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,560
they brought bad behavior

439
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,280
from somewhere else.

440
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,760
So, maybe a little bit of mentoring

441
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,320
with myself or somebody else,

442
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,120
and give them some perspective

443
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,960
on how they might be able

444
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
to accomplish things

445
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,600
a little bit differently.

446
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,080
So, given the everything

447
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,440
we've talked about here, as I approach

448
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,920
my own leadership positions down the line,

449
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,240
and now I get to be a part of

450
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,680
a wonderful team here at Hippo

451
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,560
and at J-Ventures,

452
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,440
and I get to experience

453
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,480
really incredible people

454
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,280
and incredible mentorship,

455
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,480
both from a bottom up and top down.

456
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
But as I continue along my path

457
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,080
and become

458
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,040
a technical team leader myself,

459
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,080
or potentially a CEO down the line,

460
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,000
what are the core things

461
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,160
that I need to keep in mind

462
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,600
as I'm growing the team

463
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,560
and as I'm creating this family

464
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,800
that is going to work with me

465
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,400
on bringing a product to life?

466
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,160
So, I think just in general,

467
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,600
I'm asking you hard questions.

468
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,000
Well, so you're,

469
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,080
the value of the answer

470
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,280
is equivalent to the amount of time

471
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,840
that I put into thinking about.

472
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,240
So, number one,

473
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,400
I think just intellectual curiosity

474
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,680
and curiosity in general

475
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,880
is a trait that's important to have.

476
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,920
And the other thing is,

477
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,320
they used to call it at HP,

478
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,800
management by walking around.

479
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,000
Which is you want to be in touch

480
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,800
at all levels of an organization.

481
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,160
As organizations grow,

482
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,000
sometimes people are in touch with,

483
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,480
say, one level below them.

484
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,080
But you need to really understand

485
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,480
what's going on with the organization.

486
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,000
And you need to have many touch points

487
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,120
within the organization.

488
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,200
So, you really understand

489
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,880
what's going on with the organization.

490
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,160
You need to respect the role

491
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,080
of other leaders

492
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,640
and not go around them.

493
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,080
But try to work with them

494
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,440
to help them be more effective.

495
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,080
Because if you want to grow as a leader

496
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,960
and you want to scale

497
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,120
within an organization,

498
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,760
you can't do everything yourself.

499
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,880
So, how do you empower

500
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,000
and grow other leaders around you, right?

501
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,760
As you said, check the ego at the door.

502
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,280
It's not about you.

503
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,600
Trust me, if the company is successful

504
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,400
and you're a leader in the company,

505
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,680
it's going to reflect quite well on you.

506
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,600
So, you don't need to be the star.

507
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,120
And I think that's been the case with me.

508
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,800
I'm not the star in any of the ventures

509
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,840
that I've been part of, for the most part.

510
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,360
But you know what?

511
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,000
The success of the ventures

512
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,680
that I have been successful in

513
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,400
has served me extremely well in my career.

514
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,840
So, those are just a few things

515
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,640
that off the top of my head.

516
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,320
Wonderful.

517
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,600
Peter, what are you up to now?

518
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,160
What really excites you these days

519
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,840
whether it's with investments,

520
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,280
or the industry or the ecosystem?

521
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,480
What do you get hyped about?

522
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,200
What do I get hyped about?

523
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:38,120
So, there are a whole range of companies

524
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,840
that I'm working with.

525
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,760
Some more actively.

526
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,720
Some more passively.

527
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,280
I'm obviously involved with J-Ventures,

528
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,960
which is actually a wonderful group.

529
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,360
It's just, it' a really great group.

530
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,600
But there are a number of things

531
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,640
in the machine learning space

532
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,800
as applied to some really tough problems,

533
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,080
whether it's in health care,

534
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,200
drug discovery,

535
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,440
or other problems in the industry.

536
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,680
And so, I'm frankly doing

537
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,960
a massive amount of learning

538
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,600
from a lot of other folks

539
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,720
who are really passionate

540
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
in some of these spaces.

541
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,720
And again, working with you,

542
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,880
groups of young folks,

543
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,960
I mean, just the energy is great.

544
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,120
Some of us, if you've done

545
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,240
a few early stage companies,

546
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,080
you understand how hard it is.

547
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,880
But if you're young

548
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,080
and you haven't worked with that many,

549
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,400
you don't realize how hard it is.

550
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,920
So, everybody's got great energy.

551
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,800
So, but there are some things

552
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,560
in that space that are actually

553
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,800
really really exciting.

554
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,960
And then, so, you're coming in

555
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,200
and you're and you're getting exposed

556
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,360
to all these different companies,

557
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
are involved in them,

558
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,120
both in an advisory role, board seats.

559
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,840
And why specifically, machine learning

560
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,080
for solving difficult problems?

561
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,920
I mean, there's so many

562
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,280
different things that could happen.

563
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,840
Is this a recent passion

564
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,600
that you're developing?

565
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,240
Or is this something

566
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,600
that you've grown over the years?

567
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,960
30 years ago,

568
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,080
there was something called Lisp,

569
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,120
which was the first step at AI

570
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,600
back in times

571
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,000
when I was actually working for Siemens

572
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,080
in an industrial automation.

573
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,920
And you could see back then

574
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,400
the ultimate value of some of this.

575
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
But unfortunately,

576
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,320
our computer did not scale

577
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,480
to really address the problem.

578
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,400
And it's only recently

579
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,720
that we have some architectures

580
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,800
that are able to deal with things

581
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,000
like complex neural networks

582
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,320
and other things like that.

583
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,720
That you can now start to do things

584
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,880
like self-driving vehicles

585
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,680
or re-command your systems

586
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,120
or other sorts of things.

587
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,720
So, it's something that I've always,

588
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,280
or I remember, when I was in Boston,

589
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,560
I met with some of the folks at MIT

590
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,880
who were the early folks

591
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,040
in machine learning in AI.

592
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
And again, it was interesting.

593
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,120
But something stick

594
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,920
in the back of your head realizing that

595
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,960
it isn't going anywhere for a while.

596
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,520
So, just the fact that,

597
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,800
the technology exists now

598
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,040
they actually do some of these things.

599
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,800
It's interesting.

600
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,520
Having said that, unfortunately,

601
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,800
my interests are very broad.

602
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,440
So, I have some involvement,

603
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,840
a little bit of involvement in biotech

604
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,320
and in a few other places.

605
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,520
So, it's a curse of having broad interests

606
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,640
and a lot of curiosity.

607
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,280
And that's the problem.

608
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
I love it. I love it.

609
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,840
And I definitely,

610
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,040
I aspire to be exactly that.

611
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,320
To have that curiosity

612
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,280
and to go both in-depth

613
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,080
into certain fields.

614
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,440
But go agnostic and others

615
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,920
and be able to be open minded

616
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,760
and get exposed

617
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,280
to all these different opportunities.

618
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,080
Peter, before we go,

619
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,840
I want to thank you again

620
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
for your generosity

621
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,200
and for the inspiration.

622
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,680
I've learned so much

623
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,120
through this conversation.

624
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,840
But before we go,

625
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,560
I have to ask you for three words

626
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,440
that you would use to describe yourself

627
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,520
or any of your partners in board seats

628
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:46,120
or companies would describe Peter Wexler.

629
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,840
The hardest question of all.

630
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:54,280
I think I've been an effective leader,

631
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:59,280
and have been in terms of growing teams

632
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,680
and growing teams rapidly.

633
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,480
I think I've been an effective leader.

634
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,080
I think that I am

635
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,640
a very even keeled individual.

636
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,240
Other than maybe, once a quarter,

637
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,080
I don't explode.

638
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,720
I'm just generally,

639
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,680
so, I don't freak out

640
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,520
when shit hits the fan.

641
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,680
And whatever else.

642
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,080
And maybe, just, insanely curious.

643
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,200
I was just about to say

644
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,680
that is the third word.

645
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,000
Because that resonates very very well

646
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,120
through this conversation.

647
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,640
Peter, thank you very much.

648
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,200
Toda raba.

649
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,280
This was wonderful.

650
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,960
And stay safe and stay healthy.

651
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,800
Oh, thanks, Michael.

652
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,360
And best to you.

653
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,200
And I'm sure I'll see you

654
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,400
at a meeting of J-Ventures sometimes.

655
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,000
100%. Thank you. Take care.

656
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,840
Take care, Michael. Be well.
