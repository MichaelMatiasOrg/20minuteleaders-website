00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,700
Alon Ozer, thank you for being 
on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you?

2
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,700
I’m good. I’m wonderful.
Thank you very much.

3
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,700
You’re calling from 
Miami, Florida, right?

4
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,700
Yes, yes. Correct.

5
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,700
And while things may not be 
looking up now, by the time

6
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,700
this is aired, 
it will go better, right?

7
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,700
Yes, a hundred percent.

8
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,300
A hundred percent.

9
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,300
Alon, right before this talk,
we discovered that I have no idea

10
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,700
what are the responsibilities 
of running a family office

11
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,700
and with managing 
wealth of families.

12
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,300
So, I’m very excited for this chat 
and to learn as much

13
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,700
as I can over these 20 minutes.

14
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,700
Yes, I'll be happy 
to tell you what we do.

15
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,700
Alon, what is a family office? 
Let’s start from the basics

16
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,700
because it sounds 
like I just don’t know.

17
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,300
No, you were pretty close. 
A family office is a family

18
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:16,700
that service families 
that accumulated wealth.

19
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,700
It's sometimes the first 
generation, sometimes the second,

20
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,700
it could be the third, 
and even the fourth generation

21
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,700
that holds that wealth.

22
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,700
What we do is not only 
managing the wealth,

23
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,700
we also service them 
in other capacities.

24
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,700
as advisers,
as wealth planners,

25
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,700
helping them with the exits, 
helping them with estate taxes,

26
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,700
and also educating 
the next generation

27
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,300
about the wealth 
that they accumulated.

28
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,700
And wealth comes 
with a lot of responsibility.

29
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,700
So, hold on, you just intro  --

30
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,000
it’s like opened Pandora’s box 
because you’re basically saying

31
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,700
like you do everything for 
the family, because it sounds like

32
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,700
there’s so many moving parts 
besides educating

33
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,300
the new generation, 
all of a sudden, you have this --

34
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,700
you have like an 18-year old 
who’s now venturing into the world

35
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,300
and his or her family has wealth, 
and they want to be

36
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,700
educated about that. 
You’re saying you’re also helping

37
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,700
them understand the taxes 
behind their estates and --

38
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,700
What you mentioned before, 
which was fascinating,

39
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,700
was that you don’t necessarily 
just look for new opportunities

40
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,000
to advance the wealth, 
but you’re al --

41
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,700
you’re mainly looking 
to preserve the wealth

42
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,700
and how to do 
that responsibly, right?

43
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,700
Right. Of course, you have 
different types of families

44
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,700
and different types of --

45
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,000
So if the son’s still at a young 
age, still wants to accumulate

46
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,700
more wealth. 
So, you might have different

47
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,000
objectives and different people. 
But in general, these people have

48
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
accumulated a lot of wealth. 
At some point, what you want to do

49
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
is take the majority of that wealth 
and move it, and manage it in a way

50
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,700
that you preserve your capital. 
You grow it by, let’s say, 5%

51
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
plus inflation 
or something like that.

52
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,700
But the most important thing 
is you want to manage your risk.

53
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,000
You want to stay in the game. 
You want to don’t have --

54
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You don’t want to have 
drawdowns of 20%, 30% where this

55
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,700
could actually change 
your life, your standard of living.

56
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,700
This is something 
you don’t want to happen.

57
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,000
At this point, you also want 
to focus more about philanthropy.

58
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
A lot of them do philanthropy 
early on, but at some point,

59
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,700
you get to that stage where you can 
really make a difference.

60
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
And they all want to do that.

61
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Okay. And how do you even get to be 
and to earn a family office?

62
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,700
So, what path did you take in life 
to get to the point

63
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,700
where you’re reaching this --

64
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,700
where you’re doing this 
and you’re excited by this work?

65
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,700
It’s kind of boring. 
I always did the same thing.

66
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
[laughs]

67
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,700
It’s not --

68
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,000
I mean, I finished
my military service.

69
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,700
I joined the Ministry of Defense 
[unclear].

70
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,700
And then, I started 
just working as a trader.

71
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,700
That was a very long time ago.

72
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,700
And you chose to go into 
family offices instead of

73
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,700
going into investment banking, 
instead of going to Wall Street.

74
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,700
I mean, you had a bunch 
of different options, right?

75
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,700
Right. So, prior to this position, 
I managed an endowment.

76
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,700
An endowment is like the --

77
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
you know, Funds [unclear],

78
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,300
Yale [unclear], Harvard...

79
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:19,800
All these --

80
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,700
There are a lot of stories 
about these types of funds.

81
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,700
So, I managed the fund 
like that for nine years.

82
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,700
And at some point, 
when I decided to move forward --

83
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:35,700
I didn’t want to go back 
to the old Wall Street,

84
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,700
I call it, where --

85
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,700
some of it, conflict of interests. 
It’s all about the sales.

86
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,700
It’s all about the --

87
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,700
I wanted to be able to do 
the work that I love,

88
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:50,000
which is mostly the research. 
And I always tell people,

89
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,700
90% of the work is the research; 
10% is the actual investments.

90
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,700
It takes time to get to that point 
where you can pull the trigger.

91
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,200
Yeah, you know,

92
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,700
I’m imagining you sitting 
in the office with the fam --

93
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,700
like in the family office 
managing the wealth.

94
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,700
And all day, you’re trading. 
All day, you’re signing checks

95
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,700
and you’re making transactions. 
I guess that’s not the case.

96
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,700
No, not at all. Not at all. 
We do a lot of work.

97
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,700
We speak to 
a lot of people

98
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,500
in terms of 
the research that we do --

99
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah.

100
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,700
-- with smart people in the world.

101
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,000
It’s either real estate, 
it’s private equity,

102
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,700
venture, private debts. 
You name it.

103
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,000
We want to really drill down into 
these types of investments

104
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,700
to understand where 
the market is going,

105
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,700
what should we be doing, 
where are the opportunities,

106
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,700
and where are the risks, 
which is the most important thing.

107
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:44,700
Right. And so, then I guess -- 
do you work with the family

108
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,000
on understanding what type of
risk portfolio you want to have?

109
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Is it high risk, low risk? 
What type of investments

110
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,700
you’re more comfortable with? 
And then, once you decide together,

111
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,700
you move on to looking 
at that vertical and narrowing down

112
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,700
on the actual investments?

113
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes, correct. 
Each person, each family

114
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
have their own risk tolerance, 
have their own objectives,

115
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
have their own desires 
in terms of,

116
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
again, philanthropy or education

117
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,700
of the next generation.

118
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,700
So, it's a little bit different. 
But the truth is that,

119
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,000
first of all, we have 
our investment methodology,

120
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,700
which is very strict, 
very process-driven,

121
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,000
very research-driven. 
And when you get to that point

122
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
of actually pulling the trigger 
on some investments,

123
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,700
there are not too many 
opportunities, right?

124
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,700
A lot of the stuff that you see, 
and you hear about, it’s okay.

125
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,700
It’s not great because we invest 
in a more institutional way.

126
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,000
We are very strict with the type 
of investments

127
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,700
that we’re going to do.

128
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,700
Institutional is 
synonymous to low-risk?

129
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,700
No, not necessarily. 
I don’t mind taking risks

130
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
as long as I’m getting 
compensated for it.

131
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,700
A lot of times you’re going to see 
deals that have the high risk,

132
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,700
but the compensation 
is not necessarily there.

133
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,700
So, that’s something 
that we’re not going to take.

134
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,700
In terms of institutions
I talk about --

135
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,700
I mean, the management of the --

136
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:15,700
for example, investment fund, 
their ability of back office,

137
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,000
the diligence, the research. 
We want to invest with people

138
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
that have done it a lot of times. 
And the reality is

139
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,700
that if you look 
at private equity venture,

140
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,700
the dispersion in returns 
between the top tier --

141
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,700
Yeah.

142
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:36,000
-- and the second one 
is so big that I don’t think

143
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,700
you have the choice 
as a wealth manager

144
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,700
to be with the second tier. 
You want to stick to the top ones.

145
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,700
Now, not necessarily 
you’re going to have the access --

146
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,700
- Not necessarily --
- Right.

147
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,700
-- you’re going to 
have the ability to --

148
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,700
But that’s what we work for. 
We use our experience,

149
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,700
our relationships, our firepower 
to get into these investments.

150
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,700
So, when a family chooses the 
right people to run their wealth,

151
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,700
I guess --

152
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,700
And one thing that I was --

153
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,000
One thing I was thinking, 
of course, was that

154
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,700
your credibility 
and your experience.

155
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,000
But it sounds like your network 
and your ability to get into

156
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
the right investments, 
that’s just a critical piece,

157
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,700
just like in venture capital,
were as good as

158
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,700
the deal flow we’re getting. 
And if don’t have access

159
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,000
to the best deals, 
then it doesn’t matter how good

160
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,700
we are at looking at --
at doing due diligence,

161
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,700
we’re not getting access 
to the best investments.

162
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,700
Yes.

163
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,700
But the first thing that you said 
is the more important thing.

164
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,700
First of all, 
it’s your credibility --

165
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,700
Of course.

166
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,700
-- [inaudible] they give you 
to manage their wealth.

167
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,700
You become part of their family. 
They have to be able to trust you.

168
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,700
- They'd be able to --
- I want to ask about that, yeah.

169
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,700
-- do what they want.
So that's the first step.

170
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,700
Second, it’s the access. 
But also, it’s the way that you --

171
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,700
it’s everything together. 
It’s the process.

172
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,700
It’s the risk management. 
It’s not just the best deals.

173
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,700
You can have the access 
to a lot of deals.

174
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,200
If you don’t want --

175
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,700
know how to put them together, 
you might have overlaps in different

176
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,700
areas in the portfolio.

177
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,700
And when September 2020 comes, 
everything goes down together.

178
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,200
Yeah.

179
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,000
And that doesn’t work. 
But getting access

180
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,700
to the best deals is definitely -- 
it's extremely important.

181
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,700
It’s not easy, 
but it’s very important.

182
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,000
And how do you build 
that trust with the family?

183
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,700
Because it sounds like different 
from an investment banker,

184
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,000
or Wall Street, 
or a venture capital,

185
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,700
you’re dealing with souls. 
You’re dealing with people

186
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,700
who are putting their trust in you, 
their hard-earned money with you.

187
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,700
How do you build that trust? 
Is it over time?

188
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
Do you apply to it 
like a job application?

189
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,700
How does that work?

190
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah, it takes time. 
First of all, this business

191
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,700
is all word-of- mouth. 
You get references from friends,

192
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,700
clients, people that think 
that you’re doing a good job.

193
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,300
Or they think 
that you’re a good person,

194
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,700
and that’s why they refer 
other people to you.

195
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,700
Then it’s a matter of time. 
We really have to earn

196
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,700
the trust and it’s not something 
that they do widely.

197
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
There are a lot other things 
that people are not aware

198
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,700
of that are going on 
in this market; for example,

199
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,700
the whole conflict of interest 
in this business,

200
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,700
which is the worst thing.

201
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,700
Every time I’m about 
to ask you a question,

202
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,700
you bring it up before me. 
It’s incredible.

203
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,700
Yes, conflict of interest 
in managing family wealth.

204
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,700
Is it a big thing?
Is it hard?

205
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,300
Is it --?

206
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,700
Like how do you even avoid that?

207
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,700
Or how do you keep checks 
and balances on that?

208
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,000
You have to keep checks 
and balances, absolutely.

209
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,700
And we have our own 
compliance officer that always

210
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,700
goes and makes sure 
that everybody is in compliance.

211
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,700
But the reality is that, 
look, in every --

212
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,700
and I’m not bashing here 
anybody or --

213
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,700
I’m just saying in --

214
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,000
the model of Wall Street 
and the way that all

215
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,700
the big guys work --

216
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,200
the Goldmans, the Merrills, the --

217
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,700
is that when they put you 
in an investment --

218
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,700
private equity, private debt, 
whatever it is, they’re getting

219
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,700
compensated by the fund.

220
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,200
Yeah.

221
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,700
Not only by the client.

222
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,700
Now, what about if the fund 
is not doing well?

223
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,700
Are they going to fire them?

224
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,700
Is the advice 100% non-biased?

225
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,700
It brings into the point 
where a lot of times,

226
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,000
you create conflicts. 
I’m not saying that's-- you know,

227
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,700
it’s not a good fund 
or it’s not --

228
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,300
but having that conflict, 
by definition,

229
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,700
is a problem --

230
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,300
- A hundred percent. 
- in a family office,

231
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,700
-- when you are compensated 
100% by the family,

232
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,700
and you can generate more 
money as a firm, only if

233
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,700
they need more money.

234
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,700
- So, do you generally --
- Technically --

235
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,300
Is it generally a cut 
of the profits or is it all also --?

236
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,700
Or is it more salary-driven

237
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,700
- in family offices?
- No, this is --

238
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,300
And this is one of the things 
that’s very interesting

239
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,000
about multi-family office. 
If you want to build

240
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,700
your own family office, 
it's a family, you need a --

241
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,700
a minimum wealth of 

242
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,700
between half a billion 
and a billion dollars because --

243
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,700
Really?

244
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,000
Well, you want to 
attract talents, right?

245
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Talent is expensive. 
If you run a start-up,

246
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,700
you need to pay a [unclear]...
because you went --

247
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
Talents, as in people like you 
who are knowledgeable enough

248
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
to make the right 
investments, right?

249
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,300
That’s the talent 
you’re talking about?

250
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,700
Exactly. And it’s a team. 
It’s not one person that

251
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,700
- Of course, of course, yeah.
- that can do that.

252
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,700
But when we put a couple 
of families together,

253
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,700
they share the expenses.

254
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,700
And that’s why this model works.

255
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,700
But even when they share 
the expenses, are those expenses

256
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,700
salary-driven or equity-driven 
in the profits?

257
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,700
No, no. This is only a percentage 
of the wealth that’s being managed.

258
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,300
So, if you’re not doing well, 
obviously, your revenues

259
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,700
are going to go down.

260
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,900
Right.

261
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,900
But at the end of the day, 
it’s only one portion.

262
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:03,900
We never had an issue 
about the fees that we charge

263
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,900
or anything like that. 
If you have an issue,

264
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,900
it’s going to be something 
completely different because this

265
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,900
is not going to make 
or break your investments.

266
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,700
Right? It’s something small. 
It’s about how serious

267
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,700
you take the relationship, 
how dedicated the team is,

268
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,700
and how much value 
you can add to the family

269
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
because with all due respect,

270
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,700
these are families 
with a lot of resources.

271
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,700
They can turn to almost 
any accountant, any attorney,

272
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,700
any -- right?

273
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,700
What do you do better?

274
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,700
Can they be --?

275
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,700
Can they sleep well at night 
knowing that you manage

276
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,700
all these issues?

277
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,700
That’s fascinating. 
Just like an entrepreneur

278
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,700
or a CEO may have ambitions
to grow their start-up

279
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,700
from $10 million valuation 
to 100 million, to a unicorn,

280
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,300
do family offices 
or multi-family offices

281
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:02,700
have this ambition of reaching 
for the most wealthy families

282
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,700
both because then the percentage 
of the profits is the greatest

283
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,700
because you have more assets, 
you’re putting more --

284
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,700
you’re investing more, 
but also because of

285
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,700
the status of it. 
Is that how it works?

286
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,700
I don't know if that's the status. 
It’s more of the challenge

287
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,700
to be able to show 
that what you do is really unique.

288
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,700
That’s what all the CEOs 
are saying. Come on.

289
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,700
[laughs]

290
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,700
Look, in any business that you do, 
unless you have

291
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,700
an incentive, right?

292
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
Yeah.

293
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,700
So it’s all about that.

294
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,700
But when you’re able to put all 
of the incentives together, right?

295
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,700
Right.

296
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,700
Then it works.
But you can't have the conflicts.

297
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,700
The conflicts are just --

298
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,700
at some point, they’re just 
going to destroy the relationship.

299
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,700
No, no. I’m sure. 
That’s what it sounds like.

300
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,700
Are these long-term relationships, 
or short-term?

301
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,700
How long does the average person 
spend with the family?

302
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,700
Very long term, very long term.

303
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,700
We have families that have been 
with us for three generations.

304
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,700
Three generations.

305
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
Generations. 
So, that’s a very long time.

306
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,300
I like that you’re counting it by 
generations, because essentially,

307
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,300
what you’re saying is that when 
a new generation comes,

308
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,300
they have to decide -- 
they almost have to decide,

309
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,300
whether they’re continuing 
to work with you

310
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,300
or they’re going to others, right?

311
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,300
It's very true. 
So, the statistics says that

312
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,700
the second generation, 
you have a 50-50 chance

313
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,300
for them to stay with you.

314
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,300
- Wow!
- The third generation...

315
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,300
it’s dropping 
to single digits, right?

316
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
So, if you didn't --

317
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,300
Is that because they have 
a conflict with their parents

318
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,300
and they want to go 
on a different path

319
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,000
or because they know others, 
or they feel like they want

320
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,300
to reinvent themselves?

321
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,300
Not necessarily.

322
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,300
It’s --

323
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,300
I’ll give you an example.

324
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:54,900
Millennials.

325
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,700
They have different objectives.

326
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
They have a different way 
of seeing the world.

327
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,700
They want to do things differently.

328
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,700
And they see who can 
accommodate that.

329
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,000
You know,

330
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,300
there’s not the common language 
and it’s a problem.

331
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,300
And that’s why 
we have younger people

332
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,700
also working with us

333
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,300
because they have 
to make that decision

334
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,300
once the wealth is transferred,

335
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,300
if they’re going to stay 
with that person.

336
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,300
You have to do 
that work well in advance.

337
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,300
Explain to them 
and help them

338
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,700
get to their goals, right?

339
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,700
They'll feel comfortable, 
they’ll stay with you.

340
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,300
But if you don’t, 
again, the statistics is terrible.

341
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
Wow!

342
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,300
And so, what it sounds 
to me is that --

343
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,300
what’s really special here is that, 
on one hand, you have

344
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,300
just as great 
a responsibility as

345
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,700
if you’re in investment banking. 
I would argue that you have

346
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,300
even more responsibility 
because you’re dealing with

347
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,300
actual people and these are 
relationships that you’re building.

348
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,300
But you have to employ 
these interpersonal

349
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,300
relationships and skills to
actually build the trust over time.

350
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:54,900
Right?

351
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,900
This is not just a transactional 
relationship that

352
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,900
will

353
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,000
change when you screw up.

354
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,300
But when you screw up 
or when markets fall,

355
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,300
or some decisions 
weren’t the optimal,

356
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,900
that interpersonal relationship 
you have with them,

357
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,300
that’s where it 
really counts, right?

358
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,900
So that you continue, and you 
continue that work together.

359
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,300
Yes, it’s extremely personal.

360
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:21,300
I get to the point where you help 
with the funeral arrangements.

361
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,300
- It's --
- Wow!

362
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,700
It's a --

363
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,700
It's very, very, very deep.

364
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,700
Of course, it’s deep 
as the family wants to take it.

365
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,700
- Of course.
- But once they --

366
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,700
they are able to trust you, 
then you can do a lot for them.

367
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,700
And you’re happy to do that.

368
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,000
Interesting. Okay.

369
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,700
So, what excites you most 
about this job?

370
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,300
What excites you most about running
a multi-family family office?

371
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:52,700
Oh, it’s the research process. 
It’s the ability to try

372
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,300
and build that puzzle 
to understand how the world

373
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,700
operates because 
I haven’t figured that out yet.

374
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,700
You’re very independent 
in doing that, right?

375
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,700
Because you don’t have --

376
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,700
you can basically of --

377
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,700
you can offer anything.

378
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
It’s up to y --

379
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,300
you can bring 
to the table any ideas.

380
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,700
Yes. The bringing the ideas 
is not the problem.

381
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,700
It’s first of all, you have 
to understand

382
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,000
the big picture, right? 
How the world operates.

383
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,700
The economy, the different 
cycles in the economy.

384
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,700
And once you understand that, 
then you know which

385
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,700
type of investments 
you want to bring into the table.

386
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,700
A good investment by itself 
is not necessarily a good idea.

387
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,700
It doesn’t mean that 
it’s going to go well

388
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,700
with the rest of the 
investments that you have.

389
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,700
- Right.
- And --

390
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:43,700
sending the common... 
the capital markets,

391
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,700
that’s the challenge.

392
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,700
That’s the big deal, 
understanding that some assets

393
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,300
correlate over time, 
but at some point,

394
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,700
that correlation’s going to break.

395
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,700
And you cannot trust that 
correlation to build the portfolio.

396
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,300
- Right.
- And you see that

397
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,300
over and over again. 
But unless you have a process,

398
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,300
and it’s all process, 
process, process,

399
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
you’re going to miss that. 
Then you miss out

400
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,300
on the most important, 
critical points.

401
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,300
It's so, so interesting. 
Alon, before we leave,

402
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,300
what is one thing 
that I can learn

403
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,300
as a young entrepreneur 
or a young -- you know,

404
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,700
let’s say, a young wealth 
manager of my own?

405
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,300
I don’t have much wealth. 
Nothing at all.

406
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,300
But nevertheless, 
I do have to manage

407
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,300
whatever I do have. 
What can I learn

408
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,300
from your experience 
in managing my own wealth

409
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,300
as I go down the path of life 
as an engineer,

410
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,300
as an entrepreneur or as anything?

411
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,300
Oh, I hope it’s not 
going to sound bad.

412
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,300
But I learned that what you study 
in school is very different

413
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,700
from the real world.

414
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,300
Right.

415
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,300
The economy doesn’t 
operate like that.

416
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,300
Markets and companies 
don’t operate like that.

417
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:54,700
Get your hands dirty. 
Check the tires.

418
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,300
Do the groundwork.

419
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,300
Learn how the macro 
environment really works.

420
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:03,300
Not necessarily what you see 
in supply and demand chart.

421
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,300
And in scope of -- 
because it doesn't  really --

422
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,300
You need to know about hindsight.

423
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,300
And you know,

424
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,300
engineering and entrepreneurship 
is all about foresight.

425
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
- So, it’s different.
- Exactly like that.

426
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,300
A hundred percent.

427
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
A hundred percent.

428
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,700
I love it. Alon, before we leave, 
three words that best describe you.

429
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,300
Only three words?

430
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:20,800
[laughs]

431
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
- Okay.
- Three words.

432
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,300
The important things in life,

433
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,300
then I’ll say, 
a husband, a father.

434
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,300
Yes.

435
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,300
A friend.

436
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,300
I love it.

437
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,300
And I love that none 
of the three words are not

438
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,300
necessarily correlated 
to the specific work

439
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,300
that you’re doing. 
And I think that speaks

440
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,700
a lot about the personal nature 
of the work that you’re doing,

441
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,300
that you’re not just an economist. 
You’re not just

442
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,300
a financial adviser. 
You’re relationship-driven

443
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,700
and that’s what guides it, 
which I think is wonderful.

444
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,300
It's all about relationships.

445
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,300
It’s not work is work.

446
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,300
I love it. Alon, toda raba. 
Thank you very, very much.

447
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,300
- And stay safe and healthy.
- Thank you very much.

448
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,300
I love that. 
Thank you very much.

449
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,700
Take care.

450
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,700
You too.
