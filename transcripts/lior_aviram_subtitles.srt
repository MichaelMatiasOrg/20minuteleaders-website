1
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,560
Lior Aviram, thank you for joining me

2
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,280
on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,560
How are you?

4
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,960
I am well, considering these corona days.

5
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,840
Pleasure to be with you.

6
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,960
Pleasure to be with you.

7
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,080
I mean, I'm saying,

8
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,440
I was about to say good morning,

9
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,200
but it's actually your evening soon.

10
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,080
Even though the sun

11
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,040
still seems to shine.

12
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,040
You're in Israel right now, right?

13
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,840
Right. Right.

14
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,690
And the sun is setting right behind me.

15
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,240
That's wonderful. That's wonderful.

16
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,600
Lior, it's a privilege to have you.

17
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,800
It's an honor to have you.

18
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,320
Because your 25 years of experience

19
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,280
in the legal field,

20
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,080
and within Shibolet,

21
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,640
and within high tech,

22
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,520
as a young entrepreneur

23
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,760
coming into this journey,

24
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,960
even though I do get exposed

25
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,760
to venture capital quite a bit now,

26
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,400
seeing the legal side of things

27
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,000
and understanding the complexity of things

28
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,240
that go into the life cycle of a startup

29
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,560
to M&As, to investments,

30
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,800
it's something that's almost like

31
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,240
a big black box to a lot of entrepreneurs.

32
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,360
Not just young entrepreneurs,

33
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,200
I'm assuming.

34
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,360
And what I'd love to do in this discussion

35
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,200
is dumb it down for me.

36
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,640
And I want to explore, what are the things

37
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,720
that I can be curious about?

38
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,000
What are the things that I maybe

39
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,480
shouldn't be curious about?

40
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,880
And what are the biggest pitfalls

41
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,120
that I can avoid as a young entrepreneur?

42
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,600
But before that, Lior, just,

43
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,040
I'd like to know who you are.

44
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,600
And take me a little bit

45
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,240
through your journey

46
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,160
of going into the high tech.

47
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,400
Already in the early 90s,

48
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,360
as you mentioned before,

49
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,640
it was considered high tech.

50
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,200
Right, right.

51
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,040
So, I started doing high tech

52
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,680
before there was an Israeli high tech.

53
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:06,080
Just because, before in 1990

54
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,320
there were no venture capital in Israel.

55
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,960
So, I was lucky enough

56
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,200
just by coincidence,

57
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,960
like all good things in life,

58
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,240
or lucky enough,

59
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,400
to be among the lawyers that started

60
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,960
to work with VCs early 90s.

61
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,200
We actually needed to invent

62
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,400
the subject in Israel.

63
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,520
So, what we did is, took the books

64
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,880
of the MVCA from California.

65
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,480
And translated them into Hebrew,

66
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,360
not in the language linguistic sense,

67
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,760
but in the legal sense.

68
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,720
And it was quite an experience

69
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,880
because just to then negotiate

70
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,840
and explain to the other lawyers in Israel

71
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,880
why you need preferred shares,

72
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,960
and all those issues that are just,

73
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,320
you know that, everyone knows that.

74
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,440
But then it was like something,

75
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,800
like a revolution.

76
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
You hear their revolution.

77
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,920
It's literally pioneering a lot of these

78
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,840
formal definitions and communications

79
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,520
between the different parties.

80
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,880
And it must have been quite an experience.

81
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,760
What made you

82
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,880
going to that side of high tech?

83
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,120
So, as you're getting exposed

84
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,240
to these different things,

85
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,800
you choose to concentrate on them.

86
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,680
You choose to be a pioneer in this domain.

87
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,640
Why? Why do you do that?

88
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,320
Oh, that's easy.

89
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,960
That's easy to answer.

90
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,480
You know, Israel pre-high tech,

91
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,480
it's like the covid-19, pre and post.

92
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,890
Nothing will be the same.

93
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,720
But much more. Okay?

94
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,880
I hope, much more than that.

95
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,000
Israel pre-high tech, in the legal sense,

96
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,640
in the legal profession, was something

97
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,600
that's not going to change.

98
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,720
The larger clients, where they are

99
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,520
at that point,

100
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,400
I was a young lawyer,

101
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,080
there was no other field

102
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,840
where you can start

103
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,000
with smallest client ever.

104
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,680
Like, to intrapreneurs, and turn into

105
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,840
within two years, to have a huge client,

106
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,000
the largest in the firm.

107
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,400
And this is exactly what happened,

108
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,160
to a few of our clients.

109
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,680
So, for me, it was easy.

110
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,240
I was young enough those days

111
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,440
to adapt to the change.

112
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,160
So, we actually, it was natural

113
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,280
to stay where it's low hanging fruit

114
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,680
in the legal profession at that time,

115
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,000
which is the fruits nowadays

116
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,560
are much higher.

117
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,120
That I can assure you.

118
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,760
Yeah.

119
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,240
So, now is there, I mean,

120
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,760
let's say, you're now looking

121
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,840
at new opportunities

122
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,960
and let's say, you have new founders.

123
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,080
I mean, I'm looking at myself.

124
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,520
As I start a company,

125
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,840
I don't have the funds to go

126
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,560
and pay a lawyer and pay a legal firm,

127
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,240
and the caliber of Shibolet,

128
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,160
yet I want to have the best caliber

129
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,640
because I truly believe in my business

130
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,160
and I truly believe of where I'm going

131
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,000
and then my fundraising skills.

132
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,600
So, what adaptations are there

133
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,760
for the tech scene

134
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,640
that might be a little different

135
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,440
than any other industry

136
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,320
in terms of partnering with a firm

137
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
like Shibolet to work together?

138
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,680
Is it the same as other industries?

139
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,200
Or, is it a little bit different?

140
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,240
Okay. So, I think that we started

141
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,240
with the right foot in the sense.

142
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,680
The fact that things move very fast

143
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,560
in the high tech scene allows us

144
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,160
to basically do things that are unheard of

145
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,200
in other fields of the legal industry.

146
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,320
So, we have programs of fees

147
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,240
that are actually arranged

148
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,800
for start phase.

149
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,440
So, if we believe in your startup,

150
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,720
so, we are actually, in most cases,

151
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,080
the first investors in your startup.

152
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,840
If you are an entrepreneur,

153
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,080
you come to the lawyer.

154
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,960
Lawyer in many cases,

155
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,600
is just the first station that you park.

156
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,240
And because this is the first advice

157
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,960
and it should be the first advice

158
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,720
that you get.

159
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,400
And in order to avoid from mistakes.

160
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,920
Later on at that time, you are in the most

161
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,360
vulnerable stage in your career,

162
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,720
it's easy to make mistakes.

163
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,520
It's difficult to recover

164
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,960
because you are too weak at that point.

165
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,040
So, that's the reason that

166
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,640
we are actually equipped to take over

167
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,920
all the stuff of those startups

168
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,560
that we believe in.

169
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,000
And it's not easy, actually.

170
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,160
So, we look at the team.

171
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,520
It's not easy to filter.

172
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,000
We use our best senses

173
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,640
and we do lots of mistakes.

174
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,440
Because we are not a better investors

175
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,880
than any other investor.

176
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,800
And we all do 90% mistakes.

177
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,880
Sorry?

178
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,120
How is your due diligence

179
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,880
compared to that of venture capitalists?

180
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,840
We are not into

181
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,600
the technology side at all.

182
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,360
So, we look at the people.

183
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,120
We look at their background.

184
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,360
We hear the story. And if we need,

185
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,600
we take advice from friends

186
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,760
that are more into the technology side.

187
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:43,440
Or, we talked with potential investors

188
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,160
and we hear from them.

189
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,840
And sometimes we just,

190
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,040
we feel the personality.

191
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,680
You need actually to try

192
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,040
to locate the winners.

193
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,280
That's the issue.

194
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,920
It's people at that point.

195
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,720
So, we don't have

196
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,440
all the tools in the world,

197
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,200
but we have our experience.

198
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,720
And in many cases, we do it in teams.

199
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,680
So, I have a partner who is coming to me,

200
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,280
Look, I have this young startup.

201
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,160
It's in the area of so and so.

202
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,280
And they want to do this and this.

203
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,680
And I'm actually, I'm not sure.

204
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,560
So, sometimes I meet with them again.

205
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,200
Sometimes we talk.

206
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,000
We do a little bit of due diligence

207
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,400
about the team.

208
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,000
That's it.

209
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,800
That's what we have.

210
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,240
We are doing the best

211
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,640
with what we have at that point.

212
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,800
Okay. That's incredible.

213
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,760
And what excites you most in this job?

214
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,960
Is it more the early stage entrepreneurs?

215
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,160
Is it the bigger clients

216
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,320
that they grow to?

217
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,600
Where are you on the spectrum?

218
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,920
Actually, all over it.

219
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,520
There is a lot of interest in partner.

220
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,360
And I look at me, us, as partners

221
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,280
of the entrepreneurs.

222
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,360
That's what we are.

223
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,280
We are with them in the trenches.

224
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,160
We feel the task, we are there.

225
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,840
So, with them, it's in the beginning,

226
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,280
you feel, you create something.

227
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,760
You are a creator.

228
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,720
You bring value.

229
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,120
Other value than what they have.

230
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,680
Which is a lot of experience and so forth.

231
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,280
And they bring their innocence,

232
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
which is very important

233
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,400
for a stuff like this, right?

234
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,080
Right.

235
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,960
So, that's at that stage.

236
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,280
But you know what?

237
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,600
What's interesting in the tech area

238
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,120
is that,

239
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,720
no matter how mature

240
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,920
is the technology company,

241
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,480
they always struggle for life.

242
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,720
They are struggling.

243
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,040
So, in many cases,

244
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,520
the lawyer is the only friend,

245
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,120
true friend of the CEO.

246
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,840
What does that mean?

247
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,600
Because I'm imagining a company

248
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,440
that the deal fell through.

249
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,400
Maybe like, a big customer

250
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,480
is no longer a paying customer,

251
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,720
or, they are having a hard time

252
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,160
raising their series As,

253
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,960
so, what do you mean

254
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,080
that you are the only friend of the CEO

255
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,440
or that you're in there with the trenches?

256
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,720
Because it's hard for me to imagine

257
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,040
that a legal firm,

258
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,520
being a friend of the CEO,

259
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,240
it seems like it's not

260
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,400
a friendship relationship.

261
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,800
It's much more of a formal relationship.

262
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,120
Okay. Look, this is the difference

263
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,080
in I think, at least,

264
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,800
in the way we do lawyering.

265
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,920
That there is an issue of chemistry

266
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,640
with your lawyer.

267
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,560
You need to trust the lawyer.

268
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,680
The advice that the lawyer gives you.

269
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,440
And the fact in many cases,

270
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,080
look, if a client's leaves,

271
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,560
you can't do anything, right?

272
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,720
When you are a lawyer.

273
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,040
But the question, whether to go

274
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,000
and do haircuts in salaries,

275
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,560
or to do layoffs, for example,

276
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,080
any other person in the company

277
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,200
has its own interests, right?

278
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,440
You are not interested.

279
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,960
You are just there.

280
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,920
You are his adviser.

281
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,400
So, this is a very unique position.

282
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,040
And this is one of the most

283
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,840
fascinating things about being the lawyer

284
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,600
for entrepreneurs, or CEOs, whoever.

285
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,200
That's the take.

286
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,880
In other industries, it's not like that.

287
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,280
The pace is very different.

288
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,800
Managements are figure in many cases.

289
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,720
With technology companies, even the CEO

290
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,800
or the most experienced person,

291
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,760
at least in the Israeli arena,

292
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,600
has done three M&As in his life.

293
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,240
Right. Right.

294
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,920
Me, I did 300. You see?

295
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,760
So, that's a big difference. Right?

296
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,600
Right. So, I greatly enjoy this.

297
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,280
So, first of all, it sounds to me

298
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,200
that another key difference

299
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,360
from what you're explaining then

300
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,240
what a VC might have, is in the terms

301
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,360
of the risk assessment.

302
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,920
So, the risk that you're taking on

303
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,240
as a firm, when you take on to,

304
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,000
to entrepreneurs or to engineers

305
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,720
from the Technion or whatever,

306
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,080
it's a different risk

307
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,160
than what a VC might take

308
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
when they're making

309
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,520
their one out of six investment.

310
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,480
So, a VC might make

311
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,800
six investments a year.

312
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,160
But you're able to take 60 clients a year

313
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,520
or perhaps even more.

314
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,960
And so, you're seeing many more deals

315
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,440
and you're obviously seeing

316
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,240
many more success and failure stories.

317
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,800
And I have to ask then,

318
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,160
if you're seeing so many of these deals,

319
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,880
both the successes and failures,

320
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,960
there must be some patterns that start

321
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,640
coming together again,

322
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,080
whether it is pitfalls in the early stage,

323
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,320
pitfalls in the late stage.

324
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,280
Maybe common successes

325
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,960
or common traits of an entrepreneur

326
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,160
that are among on the successful ones.

327
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,640
But what have you been observing

328
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,920
in your years?

329
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,920
I think that there are endless factors.

330
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,480
That's reality.

331
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,240
And it's very easy to fail.

332
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,720
So, there are a million reasons to fail.

333
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,080
And so, only if all the stars are aligned

334
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,680
that this is very rare,

335
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,680
then you see a big success.

336
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,080
But let's move from early stage.

337
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,840
Early stage,

338
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,640
when you are just the first team,

339
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,960
It should be a coherent team.

340
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,520
And the team should be in most cases,

341
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,400
very clearly defined.

342
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,840
There is a technology guy.

343
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,480
There is a business guy.

344
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,360
And they should actually

345
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,280
be work well together in the sense that

346
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,640
the qualities of one are making for

347
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,320
the disadvantages of the other.

348
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,760
And you can actually,

349
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,800
if you are a little bit into people,

350
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,040
you understand them and you see that.

351
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,000
You see that the conversation flows

352
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,080
and things work.

353
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,600
Yep.

354
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,320
And at that point,

355
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:32,080
it's very important to clear each of the

356
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,320
entrepreneurs, founders at that point,

357
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,720
that they are the founders, right?

358
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,080
So, their role to make sure

359
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,240
that they understand,

360
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,760
and they set expectations,

361
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,120
and so forth.

362
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,640
So, and it's easy at that point

363
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,240
to make a mistake.

364
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,000
Not to define things.

365
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,880
Work three months, and then

366
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,440
three months or six months down the road,

367
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,200
discover actually, you are not aligned.

368
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Like waterfall. Yup.

369
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,440
Yes. And one goes away,

370
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,640
and the other is staying there.

371
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,000
Doesn't have the rights to the technology.

372
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,320
The other one is fighting for shares

373
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,880
if there will be a company,

374
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,760
and then everything is just lost.

375
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,280
Do you see a lot of pre-emptive conflicts

376
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,600
in regards to shares, equity, salary, IP?

377
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,000
Is there too much of that,

378
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,640
of pre-emptive conflicts

379
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,240
that are just stalling and not letting

380
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,480
the entrepreneur continue?

381
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,080
Too many.

382
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,680
I'm not sure what is too many.

383
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,480
But I can tell you that, I would say that,

384
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,400
in about 25% the quarter of the cases,

385
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,960
that's the issue.

386
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,520
Now, let's add the first stage

387
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,400
or the next stage, is the investors.

388
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,680
Their identity.

389
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,800
They're easy to make mistakes.

390
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,040
You will take onboard the wrong guys,

391
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,680
and all of a sudden, when you go

392
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,160
to the next level of investors,

393
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,280
you are stuck.

394
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,280
They are making troubles.

395
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,880
They make your life miserable.

396
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,520
Do you advise or do you provide opinions

397
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,320
on the term sheets

398
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,760
that the entrepreneur receives

399
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,680
in terms of the future of the company?

400
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,280
So, for example, if I receive a term sheet

401
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,320
for an investor in a seed

402
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,760
that wants preferred stock

403
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,440
and wants a board seat and etc, etc,

404
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,040
do you sometimes come in and say,

405
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,560
"Michael, just be be careful."

406
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,000
"I've seen this thing before."

407
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,400
"And I'm not happy with the way

408
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,960
it's gonna go in the next rounds."

409
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,320
Yes. Sure. This is basic.

410
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,840
And we are trying, first,

411
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,760
in the tech world,

412
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,120
and this is the DNA

413
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,920
that actually we try to convey

414
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,160
to everyone on the team is,

415
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:58,080
there is no business issue or legal issue.

416
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,280
Everything is relevant to us.

417
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,000
So, when I see a term sheet,

418
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,840
I give my input to the entrepreneur,

419
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,360
assuming that I'm the advisor

420
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,440
for the entrepreneur, on everything.

421
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,840
The identity or the way

422
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,400
the investor behaves,

423
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,920
the term sheet,

424
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,440
the terms of term sheet, the future,

425
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,840
what is reflected,

426
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,000
if these are the terms that are asked

427
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,880
by the investor and so forth.

428
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,640
So, I'm trying to really be

429
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,680
as meaningful as possible in this sense

430
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,520
and not give legal comments.

431
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,480
Legal comments,

432
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,560
every five years of lawyer can give.

433
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,880
So, my added value is not there.

434
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,280
And we are trying to do

435
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,120
even more than that.

436
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,160
Look, we have a team

437
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,760
which is business development

438
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,280
for clients

439
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,720
Because we, all of a sudden,

440
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,240
a couple of years ago discovered,

441
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,840
we see a mountain of information

442
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,520
that can assist entrepreneurs

443
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,360
and investors.

444
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,240
And in most law firms,

445
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,840
no one is doing anything with that.

446
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,400
Right.

447
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,400
So, we have a team of three people

448
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,840
that sit on that data and try to assist.

449
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,240
So, we try to give input really deeper

450
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,680
than just the term sheet.

451
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,200
Even to add with additional investors

452
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,520
and so forth.

453
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,400
Wow.

454
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,920
It's one of the 300 M&As. So, it's okay.

455
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,960
Lior, this is all incredible.

456
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,880
Young entrepreneur,

457
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,640
I'm going to start my own company soon.

458
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,560
What are the things that I should be

459
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,320
most concerned about or excited about

460
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,800
as I start my journey?

461
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,280
When is the first touch point

462
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,320
that I need to make with a firm

463
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,760
like Shibolet or some other legal firm?

464
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,480
And what is the number one thing

465
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:00,880
to keep in mind?

466
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,120
Because, as you're saying

467
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,920
this is not just,

468
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,440
I'm not just asking for Shibolets

469
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,360
to incorporate me,

470
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,680
I'm asking for a partnership.

471
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm asking for them to come with me

472
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,680
on this journey.

473
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,800
And I want them to be

474
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,640
in the trenches with me,

475
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,400
so I better have good chemistry with them.

476
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:14,640
Right.

477
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,080
So, I think that to the right point is

478
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,440
at the first minute that you have,

479
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,360
like usually it's a team, right,

480
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,640
of two or three people,

481
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,920
so, once that the core team,

482
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,560
the founders to be the founders,

483
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,880
agree that they have a good idea,

484
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,280
that they are determined

485
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,720
to push through together,

486
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,480
that is the right time to come to us,

487
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,440
or, to any other lawyer.

488
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,160
So, as soon as you're agreeing

489
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,120
that you're gonna go into this

490
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,640
10-year journey, into this marathon,

491
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,080
and you know that you're working together,

492
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,320
then, this is the right touch point.

493
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Right. Right.

494
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,360
Wonderful.

495
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,000
Any later, you may be wasting time

496
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,360
or doing a mistake

497
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,800
that will be detrimental later on.

498
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,160
So, that's the reason

499
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,680
that we are the first stop, actually.

500
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,680
Before you come into any other.

501
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,920
Because, as far as I was concerned,

502
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,920
today, you can incorporate $500

503
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,120
in Delaware online,

504
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,240
and you can start your journey,

505
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,800
and you can start writing your product.

506
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,400
And maybe,

507
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,960
when you go to that pre-seed stage

508
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,200
and then you need to quickly

509
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,360
get a term sheet,

510
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,920
and then you go and you quickly find

511
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,120
the first legal firm that says hi to you,

512
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,240
but you're saying, no, this is

513
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,960
actually a long term investment.

514
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,920
This is a partnership.

515
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,720
One of the most important partnerships

516
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,240
you're gonna have

517
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,000
in the lifetime of your company.

518
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,480
And so, thank you for teaching that.

519
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,120
Lior, right before we leave,

520
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,800
I want to thank you again

521
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,040
for your generosity with your time

522
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,480
and your inspiration.

523
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,400
And the 25 years of experience

524
00:29:59,400 --> 00:29:59,920
you bring with you,

525
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,960
I think that's incredible.

526
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,280
And I've learned so much.

527
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,600
And I'm sure that anybody listening

528
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,040
has learned so much.

529
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,960
But I need three words that you would use

530
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,240
to describe yourself.

531
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,240
Okay. So, actually,

532
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,360
I will use I think, one word.

533
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,440
I'm a multi disciplinary.

534
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,960
And that's with respect to personality

535
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:25,520
and qualifications or talent.

536
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
So, that's me.

537
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,360
I'm around person.

538
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,560
I love it. I love it.

539
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,520
Leon, toda raba.

540
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,440
It came out as an American. Toda raba.

541
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,280
Toda raba.

542
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,040
My pleasure.

543
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,280
Every conversation is changing.

544
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,880
Hebrew and English,

545
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,040
it's becoming impossible.

546
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,320
So, I do the same.

547
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,000
My pleasure.

548
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,880
There you go. All right.

549
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,560
And hopefully we get to work together

550
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,560
on n venture that I hope to create

551
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,160
very soon.

552
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,000
Very happy to, Michael.

553
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,240
Take care. Enjoy.

554
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,520
Bye bye.

555
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:57,720
Bye.
