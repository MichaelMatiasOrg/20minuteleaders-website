1 A good founder has to have has to have a lot of dedication and enough of flexibility to be able to reinvent itself. For me, this is the difference between the companies that are successful and companies that are going nowhere. Levy Raiz, thank you so much for joining me. How are you? Thank you. Thanks for making this happen. It wasn't easy, I know. It wasn't easy, but I'm so glad that we made this happen with all the difficulties in the scheduling. And I believe that you mentioned after one of our mishaps email, if it's really difficult, it means that it's really, really good. So, I'm going with that mindset into this. Levy, let's talk about investments these 20 minutes. And you've had the privilege of sitting on numerous positions with venture capital funds. And you've seen countless entrepreneurs. And I'd love to sort of pick your brain from your experiences on some of the key insights that you've gained, whether it's about the type of person you like to invest in, or how does the whole pipeline look in your mind, or what entrepreneurs should be doing as they're approaching the fundraising. So, Levy, I'll let you take it from here. Tell me maybe a little bit about yourself and where you come from. Okay. Let's start with that. So, in a few words about myself. I'm in VC for the last eight years. Before that, I've been doing building companies myself. I had four companies so far. I know one of them actually succeeded and I sold it. The second one is also a success. It still exists and working and making money. And the two other ones I just miserably failed. So, that was why so I kind of learned. In what order, by the way? What was the order of them? Yeah, it was success. It was the failure. Second, kind of success, and then the failure. I like that. I like the zigzag. So, I always say it's better to fail fast rather than drag it out for years. So, that's my professional career. And eight years ago, I've been privileged to be invited to join one of the VCs to become a partner in the CPC. We've invested a lot of companies here in Israel and I've been privileged to do some great investments and some really bad investments. And now this days with the Digital Horizon VC, we are an early stage firm. I'm a venture partner dealing with all the deal flow in Israel. And I'm thirty four, married to another beautiful entrepreneur. We have three kids who are also probably look like they're very different home. That's me. That's me. What differentiates between the good investments that you've made and the bad investments? The really good ones and the really bad ones. Is there some pattern recognition that you now understand, looking back at the few that succeeded and the few that didn't succeed? Yeah, I think I can find some. You know, there are a lot of factors that are kind of objective. And sometimes it's great team, great technology and there is some just objective factor. The market timing is wrong or there is something out there that is not dependent on us, which doesn't work. That happens all the time and that's normal. Now, that's why we're investing to it. That's why it's called venture capital we take risk. With the other cases where it's more of a people's issue. I would say that the dedication of founders mixed with the flexibility of their kind of mindset is that what I found as a crucial, crucial things. What do I mean by that, there are a lot of you always trying to invest into dedicated founder, but when this founder is very dedicated and has no flexibility and is just going straight, straight ahead, hitting the mountain head to head sometimes it doesn't work. And you need to be flexible enough to accept this and to not go and just like be completely broken, but reinvent yourself. So, those companies that succeed to reinvent themselves, those are the good ones. The ones that kind of hit the wall and can't reinvent themselves, those are the ones that kind of die off. So, that's the main difference. I would say the good founder has to have has to have a lot of dedication and enough of flexibility to be able to reinvent itself. This is the for me, this is the difference between the companies that are successful and companies that are going nowhere. But how do you measure flexibility when you do, let's say, three week due diligence process, you meet the entrepreneur four or five times. How do you measure an entrepreneurs ability to be flexible? Because you're also you're funding in the early stages, when you're essentially investing in the person. How do you measure flexibility? That's actually a great question. This is something that it took me at least time to learn and to figure it out. In real life, what matters when you go and you meet a person and when you actually have a more deeper conversations, when it's not just a pitch and they just like pitching you the company, we're saying, "What do you think?" And so, like, when you actually have a deeper, deeper conversations and you meet the whole team and you see the dynamics between them, you see how they actually interact. Because usually, usually people have a very different opinions. In early stage, if there is a strong team, there are always strong opinions. And there are two ways of kind of those companies to work. Sometimes it's just a clash of opinions. And in the end, someone just says, "You know what? Okay. I'm the CEO, so I'll decide." And things are not heard much. Another thing is that you can see that it's a very slight different. The CEO isn't the final decision maker, because that's what you want from a CEO. But you see that he might be completely disagree with the other opinion, but he'll still consider it. So, there's a slight difference. If you feel that there is, I think this is a good sign, it's not a guarantee, but it's a good sign that there is enough flexibility in this person. And just something you learn from those two, three weeks of having conversations. I have, for example, I have a several occasions where I have to find kind of pull out the term sheets when we've already got to the point when it wasn't the first date or second date, when I was kind of that we started our relationship to the next level. And right before signing the term sheet, you see that the person has just lost, his flexibility ended after a third meeting and now it's like he's completely or she's completely inflexible. And that's where I usually pull out, if that happens. Right. I think that's really interesting. And so, how many investments would you say you've seen or played around with over your career? I have a portfolio of twenty five plus companies that I actually, like my teams and I invested. The overall, I would say probably over, over these eight years, probably several thousand companies. And honestly, to be honest, that I actually like dug in deeply, I would say it's probably maybe five, 700, I don't know, a lot of companies those eight years. So, what part of this cycle of venture capital do you enjoy most personally? So, there's so many different moving pieces, right? And anybody who's gone through a cycle of fundraising knows that it's like a big roller coaster, both for the entrepreneur, but also for the investor from the deal sourcing to the diligence to the decision to then supporting the portfolio company. It's a whole balogun. So, which part is your favorite? So, the favorite part is really is a some kind of a exit. You know, that's the favorite part for everyone. And when everyone is happy and usually it's after the hard, like the hard track of difficulties and all kinds of things happen. Now, you're asking about like more, like earlier part there's a joke between VCs. VCs say that the fun is over when you actually wire the money. That's one. So, the part before that, the whole getting to know the company, meeting the entrepreneurs, getting really into what they are doing, and being getting to know the entrepreneurs, I think this is the funnest part. This is the most enjoyable part. And specifically, sometimes, you just click with the founders, with the entrepreneurs. So, for me, the people ability to kind of become a part of their journey and be helpful to them and meet their world, because you're like you meet those very very exciting people who are like they've done things, they are doing things. They are dreamers, they're executioners. And you kind of you get all this energy, this is the most exciting part. And also, that's where you decide for yourself how you can actually be helpful to the company, like what you can actually deliver. A lot of funds, a lot of VCs say value add and like, I'll make introductions, I'll bring you in more and more investor to help you raise money and so on. So, that's something that a lot of VCs can do because everyone comes with some kind of background. So, sometimes it's, it's when you connect to the CEO and we actually feel that we can help the CEO on specific tasks like the CEO comes to you and says, "Hey, bro, I need help with hiring this person." "I can't fill this position for a while." "Please help, help." That's what kind of makes you feel like you're really part of this company when you can solve specific issues and not just be another person to make introductions. That makes perfect sense. So, if you're now looking at young entrepreneurs that are starting their journey, perhaps they've never raised money from VCs, or they're now, they're reaching new rounds that they haven't reached before. So, what advice would you give them as they're thinking, both in terms of growing and scaling the company? And you've seen some companies scale with the portfolio or in terms of their communication with the venture capital partners. Okay. That's a good question. I would say, first of all, it has to be you have to realize that the raising money is not easy. It's just not it's not a simple process. And there will be a lot of discouraging moments when people will be saying, you'll get no up to no. And also you will get multiple completely contradicting opinions from smart people. You go to one smart VC and he tells you, "Hey, you're doing all these wrong." "You have to do XYZ." And you'll go to another person and he'll tell you completely opposite thing. So, you have to be able to focus on what you do and be kind of, again flexibility. Listen to the people, get their feedback just a little bit but keep your core. Don't link analogies. Don't go and change your what do you do from meeting to meeting. That's one thing. How do you balance that? So, how do you balance when you're approaching two different VCs, both very reputable, but they're giving contradictory ideas and you're sort of in the middle? Because the whole power struggle at that point is the VC is more knowledgeable. They're assessing your validity. And if a VC tells you that you're doing something wrong, then you're questioning yourself. Another VC says you're doing something right then now you're confused as to how to approach this. So, I think, first of all, the by default, by definition, I wouldn't say that the VC is more knowledgeable. or smarter than you. The VC is another entrepreneur, hopefully another entrepreneur who is just in a different stage in his life. And someone who, a VC the good VC is looking for a CEO of the company who is a leader, who can lead this opportunity. A VC doesn't want to lead this thing, like if I would be smart enough, I would say no to the entrepreneurs. I'm saying, "Guys, you know, if I would know this better than you so, I would probably start this company." "Why am I investing here?" "Because I trust you in your judgment." So, I think that's the point. You have to be, there's a very thin border between, very thin line between being stubborn and kind of done next to being flexible, then next is being completely all over the place. So, I would say this flexibility, when you do know what you're doing and you do believe in what the way you chose, but you understand that you probably do not know all the details and there are other people who have experienced that you have to acknowledge. So, that's the one that creates the healthy conversations. And, you know, sometimes VCs, great VCs have wrong opinions. You know, every great VC, I'm not even so great, have an anti-portfolio where they missed a lot of good companies. So, that's them. That's always happens. Right, I think that almost every VC, that every venture capital partner that I met in Silicon Valley so far has this crazy story of how they passed on Airbnb or Lyft or one of those great companies when they were young. And now and then they're reflecting. They're thinking, "Okay, why did we missed them?" And it's not like the VC knows everything and that you're able to assess amazingly the validity of a company, you also miss. A good friend of mine passed on Airbnb. Yup, that's the reality. Definitely. Exactly. Now, you have young entrepreneurs that are looking to meet you, for example, that are that are raising money, what kind of advice just seeing a lot of other companies would you give them specifically saying these are the things that you should be focusing in the early stages of your company. Maybe it's to go full throttle on fundraising, or maybe it's to find some balance, and how do they look for the right investors. What are some things that you think are really important? So, you know, I always, always ask this question myself, as also, you know, as the entrepreneur, because I've raised money before for my companies. And hopefully if I start other companies, I will probably raise money again. So, it's hard to judge from the position of the VC. But I think, I'll speak of myself, when the entrepreneurs come to me in their early stage, first of all, I look for the acknowledgement that they don't know everything. When people come to me and they start laying out a three year plan with like details in this, I'm like, whoa. "Guys, you haven't really started yet." "How they know what's going to happen?" And my point the answer is, "We don't really know but that's what we expect and that's what we're going to go for." Right. The idea is, I want to see that the entrepreneur thought through a lot of things really deeply and they understand the challenges, the problems and unknowns that they have in the way. Right. While keeping in mind that they don't know everything. Yeah, because that's exactly. Because it's very strange to see an early stage company, seed company comes to you and says, "We're have this five pilots in three months, we're going to close those five clients and so on." So now, and so what happens if you guys don't close? So, I would say that they'd be realistic. And being visionary, but at the same time being realistic. It's a lot of contradictory things. It's something that kind of specifically speaks to me. Right. I think to me, it sounds like you're looking for the visionary and having the humility of knowing that while you might be a visionary, it's quite possible being visionary doesn't contradict being open minded. Understanding that the vision can change according to the circumstances. Right now you have the information X, already have X plus Y, that's a new world right there. Now you have to be visionary again and reinvent yourself. I know very important, the crucial thing is just know your stuff. Meaning, when you speak to a CEO that gives you the product, it usually happens when the CEO is a product person, not really a business person. You have a really deep conversation about the product and what it does and what we'll do, envision how it's going to change the world that can change everything. I want to get to the card numbers and just, okay, so let's talk about how we can make it happen. That's when it starts, you know, Oh, this is like my other co-founder did hat, and I don't know this number. You don't have to know everything, but you have to be able to operate your excels and your financials, like the way you're actually that you have it in your mind. So that's what gives you confidence about the CEO and about the co-founders. I think there is a growing misconception, almost that people believe that they're coming in for an interview. Like the VC is going to ask them as if it's on Shark Tank, they're going to ask them for these numbers and they're testing their memory to see whether they're serious or not. But that's not how it works. When you ask somebody for a number or like a forecast for something, it's not to test whether they memorize the number. It's an actual question. And if they give off a vibe that they're not owning the information, that they don't understand the process of, that maybe the other co-founder has done. It's fine that they did the work. But you need to understand the process and be able to take ownership of it if you're representing the company. And so, I think that that is an interesting element. Yeah, that's a great element. And it's just important because exactly what you said you want to see, like you want to understand this number. Like, here's a VC, as a person who's done business yourself, you understand that there is a very high probability that those numbers aren't correct for all different reasons. That you want to understand that the person understands how this actually forms, how that comes to life. And if the person understands that, then you can say, okay, this guy actually knows what to expect and he'll be able to react. Right. So, that's what you want to do. Exactly. I love it. Levy, this has been so much fun. Unfortunately we have to end. 20 minutes are over. But I have the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. I've been waiting for that. So, first of all, thanks for giving me a heads up for this. I've been actually able to think about it. So, I would say that I think when I think about myself, I'm thinking about curiosity. I happen to be a very I would say, what's the word, the English, I don't like following the herd, I don't like following the crowd. Yeah. And the last thing I would say, I'm probably pretty entrepreneurial, which sometimes actually is a negative to be a VC because you get too passionate about things. And instead of cold mind outside, you become one of the hard brained inside. Levy, thank you so much. This is really great. Toda raba. Stay safe and stay healthy until this craziness is over. Yeah. Let us all come out of it better and stronger and healthier people. May God help us all. Just to stay safe through all this. Thanks. Thanks for having me.
