1
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,160
Anne Blum, thank you so much

2
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,800
for being on my show.

3
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,680
How are you?

4
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,040
Thank you so much for having me.

5
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,080
I'm delighted to be here.

6
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,600
I'm great.

7
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,040
Six months into quarantine,

8
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,600
but still surviving. I can't complain.

9
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,040
How are you?

10
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,040
So, I'm doing fine.

11
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,320
But I see only one plant.

12
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,960
And you said you have a hundred plants

13
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,920
in your apartment and three trees, right?

14
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,640
Yes. This is one of the trees.

15
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,200
Most of the plants are downstairs.

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,440
It's hard to carry them up the stairs.

17
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,800
Of course. Of course.

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,520
In my living room,

19
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,240
I've basically turned it into a greenhouse

20
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,080
During quarantine,

21
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,720
I've had a lot of free time.

22
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,240
So, I've been doing gardening indoors

23
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,080
because I don't have any

24
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,760
outdoor space, unfortunately.

25
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,240
And also painting.

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,040
I love it.

27
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,480
I love it.

28
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,120
Okay. So, I've been hearing that a lot.

29
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,600
A lot of people have been taking up

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,120
botanics and gardening lately.

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,200
So, it's definitely very interesting.

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,360
I figure if you can't go outside,

33
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,920
might as well bring the outside in.

34
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,120
100%. 100%.

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,000
So, Anne, I mean,

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,280
it's a really fascinating journey

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,320
that you've had.

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,560
And I'm very excited

39
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,960
to hear about the insights

40
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,360
that you've gained along the years

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,600
from running two accelerators in New York.

42
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,960
One of them the German accelerator,

43
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,920
another one Ellis.

44
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,720
Moving on to early stage venture capital

45
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,680
helping European and Israeli startups

46
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,040
break into the US market

47
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,160
with Angular ventures

48
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,960
as the head of platform.

49
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,920
But you started out in corporate.

50
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,760
You started out

51
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,680
in mobile developer outreach

52
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,440
for Facebook, right?

53
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,640
Well, actually, my first job ever

54
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,400
after college was at Goldman.

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,000
As HR.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,200
Yeah, HR. So, that was a great start.

57
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,040
I really enjoyed starting my career

58
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,080
at a large company,

59
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,680
especially Goldman.

60
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,240
It's a fantastic life's work

61
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,120
and I got to meet and work

62
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,760
with some really incredible smart people.

63
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,840
100%. So, I have to ask

64
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,040
the German accelerator.

65
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,440
Like I mentioned, I was looking forever

66
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,160
for what is the name

67
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,360
of the German accelerator.

68
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,680
And you just helped me

69
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
clarify a second ago.

70
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,480
But please clarify

71
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,840
for everybody watching this.

72
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,360
So, the German accelerators

73
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,560
the name is German accelerator.

74
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,680
Which is probably the most German way

75
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,800
to come up with an accelerator name.

76
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,520
You have no idea how many times

77
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,240
when I worked there, people would be like,

78
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,760
"What's the name

79
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,720
of the German accelerator?"

80
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,154
I'm like, "The German accelerator."

81
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:39,130
I'm sure. I'm sure.

82
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,120
So, it's always like it's capital now.

83
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,440
It works with title [--]

84
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,320
and thought through it.

85
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,680
The program is doing quite well.

86
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,200
Whatever makes people talk about it

87
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,480
the more obviously works.

88
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,680
But you're not from Germany.

89
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,280
You're from France originally, right?

90
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,840
So, my dad's American.

91
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,240
He's a Jew from the Bronx.

92
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,080
And then, my mom was from Paris.

93
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,240
So, I basically spent,

94
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,640
I was born in London,

95
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,120
then lived in Paris for a bit.

96
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,000
And when I was three, I moved to New York.

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,840
Still spending my summers in France,

98
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,600
typically in Paris or the south,

99
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,040
specifically Basque Country.

100
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,520
And then in New York,

101
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,560
I grew up in Westchester.

102
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,760
I went to the French American school.

103
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,640
So, I still speak French

104
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,480
and try to keep that connection alive.

105
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,320
But I'm very Americanized in my culture.

106
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,920
No. I don't speak German,

107
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,840
not German at all.

108
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,640
Fortunately, that wasn't a prerequisite

109
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,080
to working at the German accelerator.

110
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,880
How do you go from HR at Goldman Sachs

111
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,560
to mobile developer outreach

112
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,240
at Facebook

113
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,920
to running two accelerators

114
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,320
at the same time in New York?

115
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,400
It's a great question.

116
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,760
I would love to say that

117
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,120
I had this big grand plan for my career.

118
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,920
I'll do this too and then I'll do that.

119
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,280
No. Not at all.

120
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,120
This is not planned. It just happened.

121
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,560
And don't get me wrong,

122
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,600
I'm very happy with the outcome of it.

123
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,240
But the mindset I had

124
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,640
when I started my career was,

125
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,320
or at least my first job at Goldman was

126
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,160
I love this, this is fantastic,

127
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,960
I'm supporting.

128
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,440
Basically my role there was

129
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,400
in learning and development

130
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,720
and helping the 9,000 plus engineers

131
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,920
that worked at Goldman

132
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,440
know everything they needed to know

133
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,880
from technical side,

134
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,120
all the way to soft skills.

135
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,960
And I was there for

136
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,840
about a year and a half.

137
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,640
And I thought I was going to be a lifer.

138
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,920
Like, I really jive

139
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,840
with the corporate culture.

140
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,040
My dad had worked there for a long time.

141
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,840
And I think especially,

142
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,320
coming straight from college,

143
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,560
being in a part of the whole,

144
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,600
like most classes and training programs.

145
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,640
It is just a lot of fun.

146
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,880
And then, I knew ultimately

147
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,160
I didn't want to be in HR long term.

148
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,240
It just wasn't exactly,

149
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,560
I really enjoyed it

150
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,840
but I knew that I didn't want

151
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,080
to make a career in that.

152
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,400
Now, when you say HR, just to clarify,

153
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,120
because there's a lot of

154
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,920
different facets in HR,

155
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,080
so what specifically

156
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,200
were you working on within Goldman Sachs?

157
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,680
So, learning and development.

158
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,720
And I was specifically

159
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,840
on the Goldman Sachs University

160
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,280
at technology training.

161
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,200
So that I was very lucky and that

162
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,080
I was placed on the tech team.

163
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,040
Because you get accepted and then you go

164
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,440
to Goldman Sachs University

165
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,640
and they have different teams aligned

166
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,040
to the different divisions.

167
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,880
And most people wanted to be

168
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,400
on the IT team

169
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,720
or security is like the sexy teams.

170
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,000
And I was like, they put me on tech.

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,440
This is like I find interesting,

172
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,880
I want to be with my techies.

173
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,040
And back then, I think,

174
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,360
especially in New York, Tech was cool.

175
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,240
And I was very lucky

176
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,280
that I got this my team.

177
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,680
I got to meet a ton

178
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,160
of really great engineers

179
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,920
and work with them.

180
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,320
And also happened to fall

181
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,240
into this tech world,

182
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,680
which I fell in love with.

183
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,160
And after working with engineers

184
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,080
for a while, I realized,

185
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,200
Okay, if I'm really meant into this tech scene,

186
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,200
how can I get more into this.

187
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,820
And the logical conclusion was

188
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,400
go to a tech company.

189
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,560
And one of my best friends from Cornell,

190
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,760
she was at Facebook

191
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,240
working on the FB startup program.

192
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,640
So, she pulled me in.

193
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,000
It happened very quickly.

194
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,280
And I joined at the end of 2015.

195
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,200
And it was an amazing experience.

196
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,240
I mean it was a very small team.

197
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,400
We were three people

198
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,640
and we were running a program

199
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,120
with at the time over 12,000 startups

200
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,080
all around the world.

201
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,920
So, it was a very much scaled program.

202
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,400
But we were able to support them

203
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,440
in a scaled manner

204
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
to events all around the world,

205
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,240
give them benefits,

206
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,920
mentorship from Facebook, community, etc.

207
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,480
So, you're saying that there wasn't

208
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,280
this grand plan, but I do see a pattern.

209
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,640
I am working on a pattern here

210
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,280
that you're starting out in finance,

211
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,400
but you're gravitating towards tech

212
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
and then you find yourself

213
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,680
helping 12,000 startups within Facebook.

214
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,360
So, it is now very logical

215
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,440
as to how you went

216
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,880
to create two accelerators

217
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,080
and then you end up helping leverage

218
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,600
the portfolio companies

219
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,760
for an early stage venture capital fund

220
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,960
like Angular Ventures.

221
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,600
Absolutely.

222
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,120
So, I will say that

223
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,760
when I was still in school

224
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,480
and I didn't know what I want to do,

225
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,720
I just knew that I wanted to have

226
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,520
a positive impact, whatever it was

227
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,680
that I was doing.

228
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,960
And then fell into the tech world

229
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,040
and then ended up working

230
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
with startups at Facebook.

231
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,840
And that's when I knew,

232
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,160
Okay, I fell in love with startup Game

233
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,040
and this is what I wanted to do

234
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,600
for the rest of my life.

235
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,320
To be supporting startups,

236
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,360
hopefully helping them

237
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,520
achieve their goals.

238
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,760
And ideally, I would love to be involved

239
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,000
with building the next Google

240
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,280
or other big tech company.

241
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,720
Right.

242
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,440
And it was a really awesome experience,

243
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,040
I think, especially being in Silicon Valley

244
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,640
I moved there in 2015,

245
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,600
Facebook was growing

246
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,400
incredibly quickly at the time.

247
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,120
There is nothing quite like it.

248
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,040
I will say from a social perspective,

249
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,360
moving from downtown Manhattan

250
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,640
to Menlo Park, it was like it.

251
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm sure.

252
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,720
It was a bit of a change.

253
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,280
But it was an incredibly exciting experience

254
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,000
and one that I was very fortunate

255
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,040
to be a part of.

256
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,400
And I was on the platform

257
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,200
partnerships team.

258
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,160
And the thing with Facebook is

259
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,920
things change really quickly

260
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,480
from one day to the next.

261
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,960
So, after about a year and a half

262
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,600
working there, I knew that

263
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,160
I wanted to come back to the East Coast.

264
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,960
Most of my family and friends are here.

265
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,600
And I also saw

266
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,920
that the New York City tech scene

267
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,400
was starting to really come into its own.

268
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,000
And I wanted to be a part of that

269
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,000
because there's something here

270
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,760
and I miss the New York energy.

271
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,120
And there's something really special

272
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,840
about New York, so, I came back.

273
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,560
And I did something it's like

274
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,120
I feel like most people

275
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,520
would discourage doing it,

276
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,280
but I thought it was fantastic,

277
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,480
is after working at Goldman and Facebook,

278
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,040
I was tired.

279
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,280
Both were very intense jobs,

280
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,120
working late night every night,

281
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,840
working almost weekends.

282
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,440
And I was like, "I need a break."

283
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,040
So, you go and you ran two accelerator

284
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,760
at the same time.

285
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,880
It makes sense.

286
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,760
Well, before that,

287
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,880
I took six months off

288
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,640
to travel the world.

289
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,280
I went to Israel for the first time,

290
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,640
which is amazing.

291
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,200
And I went to a bunch of other places.

292
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,400
And I thought like

293
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,120
being somewhat of a workaholic.

294
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,600
I thought I would be so bored

295
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,800
during my time off

296
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,880
and that was not at all the case.

297
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,560
I was happy until it last.

298
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,520
I was like, I could do this

299
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,760
for a couple of years. This is great.

300
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,400
A couple of years.

301
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,440
Then you throw yourself again

302
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,080
into this environment.

303
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,640
I'd love to understand a little bit better

304
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,960
about your insights from

305
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,360
running those two accelerators.

306
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,600
Specifically this whole notion

307
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,960
of breaking into the US market.

308
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,600
I think it's something

309
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
that's extremely fascinating

310
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,800
both for startups that are starting out

311
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,360
in the US market,

312
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,160
but also for a lot of my friends

313
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,320
around Europe and Israel

314
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,760
who are running their companies.

315
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,360
A lot of them are considering

316
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,520
when to relocate.

317
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,680
I'm very very good friends

318
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,240
with Shuly and Gil from UpWest

319
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
and Yair, a guy from Fusion LA,

320
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,600
and so there's a lot of talk about

321
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,760
how to help outside companies

322
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,720
break into the US market.

323
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,920
And I'd love to hear a little bit

324
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,200
about your insight from doing that,

325
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,360
both from the accelerator

326
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,640
and then we'll transition also

327
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,080
into your  work with Angular Ventures.

328
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,720
Of course. Yeah.

329
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,080
So, when I came back to New York,

330
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,880
I started working

331
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,960
at the German accelerator.

332
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,680
And that program was about

333
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,840
bringing German startups to the US market.

334
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,960
I think that Germany

335
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,440
was ahead of the game.

336
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,240
There is actually a program

337
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,600
sponsored by the German government.

338
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,840
So, it's great for the startups.

339
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,920
Zero equity, zero fees.

340
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,640
Yeah. Which is very special.

341
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,400
And I think Germany rightfully realized

342
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,440
that the way to long term

343
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,560
grow their economy was really investing

344
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,400
in their startups.

345
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,080
And a big part of that investment

346
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,160
is helping them come to the US.

347
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,040
I think that this is something

348
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,320
that's especially true

349
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,680
for companies that are B2B,

350
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,160
especially enterprise.

351
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
Just because so many

352
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,200
of the largest companies

353
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,840
are based in the US.

354
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,160
And being able to meet with them

355
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,560
and get their feedback

356
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,120
and bring them on as design partners

357
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,760
is so vitally important.

358
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,520
So, that program,

359
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,400
I ran that program

360
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,080
as a program manager for two years.

361
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,360
And then, also saw that

362
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,720
there was a big appetite for startups

363
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,520
who wanted to come to the US

364
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,200
from other parts of the world.

365
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,720
I know Israel that's been so ingrained

366
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,280
in the Israeli ecosystem for so long

367
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,520
that for Israelis,

368
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,240
it's like obviously, this is a no brainer.

369
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,560
But for a lot of other countries,

370
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,880
it was less obvious.

371
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,520
I think, too, for startups

372
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,400
let's say from France

373
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,560
or from Italy or Germany,

374
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,960
there can be that fallacy of like,

375
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,480
my market is big enough, right?

376
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,160
I can go to the top French companies

377
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,640
and grow it through there.

378
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,280
But ultimately, you tap out

379
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,840
of your market really quickly.

380
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,760
And by the time you're like,

381
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,080
okay, I conquer the French market

382
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,640
now it's time to go to the US,

383
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,320
you could have a competitor here

384
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,760
that's already taken over the market

385
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,800
and you might be put

386
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,440
at a serious disadvantage.

387
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,560
So, we saw that there was this need.

388
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,440
So, I co-founded Ellis Accelerator

389
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,560
and we ran three different cohorts

390
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,520
through that program.

391
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,040
And that was all about bringing companies

392
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,960
from all around the world to the US.

393
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,360
And it worked pretty well.

394
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,800
I'd say that the biggest reasons

395
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,840
for startups to think about

396
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,080
coming to the US and obviously things,

397
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,000
the way you do that now with covid

398
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,680
is a bit different

399
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,640
than the way you did it before.

400
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,880
But the reasons are still

401
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,000
fundamentally the same sales acceleration.

402
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,960
So, we've actually done a bit of research

403
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,480
and for more than 80% of startups

404
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,720
that come to the US,

405
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,440
their sales drastically increased after.

406
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,880
Really? 80%?

407
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,080
83%. Yes.

408
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,200
83%. That's wow.

409
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,120
Yeah. And then also,

410
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,280
it's much easier to fundraise, right?

411
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,680
There is a lot of investors in the US,

412
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,120
there's a lot of money flowing.

413
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,800
And so, for about 40% of the startups

414
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,680
that came here,

415
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,840
they had an easier process fundraising.

416
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,760
But I do have to ask, Anne,

417
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,120
because obviously there is this

418
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,960
the mindset shift is a challenge

419
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,640
on its own, right?

420
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,600
So, providing that accessibility

421
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,120
into the American mindset

422
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,480
and actually making that move

423
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,960
of transitioning the business

424
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,280
towards the US market,

425
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,360
but what other challenges did you notice?

426
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:28,960
Whether it's through

427
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,880
the German accelerator or else,

428
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,960
what are some of the common challenges

429
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,840
that the companies

430
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,000
or early stage companies face

431
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,320
as they come to the US?

432
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,400
And they're saying like,

433
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,960
wow, this is something either we didn't expect

434
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,840
or, wow this is like a hurdle that we're facing

435
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
along with a lot of other newcomers here.

436
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,240
I think there's a lot of challenges.

437
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,120
Some of them are foreseen

438
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,320
some of them are not.

439
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,760
I would say an interesting thing,

440
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,280
especially I'm based in New York,

441
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,120
a lot of founders they come here

442
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,600
and they're just blown away

443
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,390
by how expensive everything is, right?

444
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,096
It's like you come here,

445
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:04,720
[--]

446
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,160
everything is expensive.

447
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,040
And so, I would say going into it,

448
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,360
be prepared to make an investment

449
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,040
because there will be

450
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,400
a lot of upfront costs.

451
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,080
So, that's one thing.

452
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,040
It's a big investment

453
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,360
just from a time perspective

454
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,520
and also a capital perspective.

455
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,960
I would say managing the culture

456
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,040
is quite difficult

457
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,800
when you now have a team

458
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,480
in the US, in Israel.

459
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,440
Time makes it challenging to me

460
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,200
when you're hiring American employees,

461
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,080
the culture, there can be some clash

462
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,320
where people,

463
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,720
you both speak in English

464
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,760
but you may still not be able

465
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,800
to understand what the other person

466
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,000
is saying implicitly.

467
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,600
And then I would say to another track

468
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,280
that a lot of startups I see fall into

469
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,440
is hiring the wrong people.

470
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,680
You see this especially with sales people.

471
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,440
American sales people are really good

472
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,640
at selling themselves.

473
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,960
And especially for someone

474
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,800
coming from outside the US,

475
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,640
that you hear them

476
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,320
and they talk about their sales experience

477
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,240
and it's like, it's perfect.

478
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
This person is going to grow

479
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,080
our sales funnel tremendously.

480
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,840
And then a couple months down the line,

481
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,560
it doesn't work.

482
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,760
I would honestly say that most times,

483
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,880
the initial sales people

484
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,920
don't end up working out.

485
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,000
So, the advice I'd give there is

486
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,200
be very very careful

487
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,800
who you bring on to the team.

488
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,480
Hire slow and if they don't work out,

489
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,760
like if you're even thinking

490
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,920
about letting someone go, then go.

491
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,320
Right.

492
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,960
Hire slow, fire fast.

493
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,680
Exactly.

494
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,440
And I think that holds true

495
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,720
both domestically

496
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,320
and when you're in the US.

497
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,640
But especially because

498
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,520
salaries are more expensive here.

499
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,480
It can be very costly to keep someone on

500
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,400
if they're not bringing in real revenue.

501
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,600
100%. 100%

502
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,280
And I want to make sure

503
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,800
we also have enough time

504
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,000
to talk about Angular Ventures

505
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,880
because I think that

506
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,240
being head of platform

507
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,080
for an early stage fund,

508
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,880
the mission is very clear.

509
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,440
And it's something

510
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,800
that I really resonate to

511
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,080
an it's not too far off

512
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,000
from what you were doing

513
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,600
with the two other accelerator's.

514
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,480
But now you're doing it

515
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,520
with the head of the VC

516
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,080
and you're doing it

517
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,200
with portfolio companies

518
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,880
that you have a stake in, right?

519
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,720
So, it's no longer just companies

520
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,120
that are coming in and they're asking

521
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,000
for your help, but you actually,

522
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,360
you have a stake in the game.

523
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,560
Talk to me a little bit about

524
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,640
what Angular Ventures is

525
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,000
and what is your specific role

526
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,720
within that fund

527
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,480
that is bridging the gap between

528
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,080
basically the whole world?

529
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,560
Absolutely.

530
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,120
So, basically, Angular Ventures

531
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,400
is an early stage fund that invests

532
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,040
in startups from Europe and Israel.

533
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,720
We typically do checks from anywhere

534
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,720
from 200,000 to 1.5 million.

535
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,080
We do lead, we do follow on.

536
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,280
Our focus is deep tech enterprise.

537
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
About half of our portfolio currently

538
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,920
is Israeli based or Israeli founders,

539
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,680
and the other half is

540
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,400
spread out throughout Europe.

541
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,200
And I met Gil Dibner,

542
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,320
the partner of the fund,

543
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,320
about a year before the fund

544
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,800
officially closed for fund one.

545
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,840
And I was always intrigued

546
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,080
by venture capital.

547
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
I wasn't necessarily pursuing it

548
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,800
because I was happy

549
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,040
in the accelerator world.

550
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,080
But I was really interested

551
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,040
with what Gil was doing.

552
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,960
His track record is really impressive,

553
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,580
having four out of 30 investments

554
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,800
that he's made have become unicorns.

555
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,280
And then the idea of working in,

556
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,120
because the downside with working

557
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,560
in the accelerator world is you're working

558
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,240
with these companies super intensely

559
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,960
for three months.

560
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,400
And then, it's like little birds.

561
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,200
they fly away and they go

562
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,240
do their own thing.

563
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,360
And yeah, you obviously still keep in touch.

564
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,160
But it's not the same level of work.

565
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,920
Whereas in the VC world,

566
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,560
and this was something

567
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,880
that really appealed to me is that

568
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,080
you can have this long term relationship

569
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,520
with these founders, at the end

570
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,040
and at the absolute earliest stage,

571
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,880
we'll do checks

572
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,280
with someone with just an idea.

573
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,560
We like getting in very very early

574
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,040
and help them build their company

575
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,760
from the ground up.

576
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,040
And then work with them

577
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,320
for 10 years plus maybe.

578
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,160
And so, that was

579
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,280
incredibly appealing to me.

580
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,640
And then also the idea,

581
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,480
having founded my own company before.

582
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,760
I love the idea of

583
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,640
being the first platform hire

584
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,120
and building the platform up

585
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,040
from the ground up.

586
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,880
And fortunately, I would say that Gil,

587
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,680
the partner of the fund,

588
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,440
he is very dedicated to working

589
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,000
with the portfolio companies as well.

590
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,600
So, he spends about half his time

591
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,440
working with existing companies

592
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,320
and the other half obviously,

593
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,480
working on a deal flow

594
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,840
and evaluating the opportunities.

595
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,040
Of course that shifts

596
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,160
with the covid epidemic,

597
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,920
I'm sorry, the covid pandemic.

598
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,600
Like many other VC's

599
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,040
we were primarily focused

600
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,960
on our own portfolio even though

601
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,760
we were still doing deals actively.

602
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,480
But just making sure that the portfolio

603
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,960
will survive and thrive

604
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,360
during this time.

605
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,000
Of course.

606
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,960
So, we've built some

607
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,120
few really exciting things

608
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,320
on the platform side.

609
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,800
Ultimately, our goal is to be supportive

610
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,560
of our founders and their startups

611
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,160
and ensure that they have

612
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,720
all the resources and connections

613
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,360
they need in order to be successful.

614
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,800
So, I would say some of the most

615
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,680
more interesting or impactful things

616
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,040
that we offer the portfolio companies

617
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,960
are we have about

618
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,480
a dozen advisory partners,

619
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,720
which include the two unicorn founders

620
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,280
from JFrog and SiSense.

621
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,960
And we also have subject matter experts

622
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,880
from branding, marketing, sales, etc.

623
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,200
So, whenever any of our

624
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,320
portfolio companies have a need

625
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,880
on one of these key areas

626
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,800
we'll pair them

627
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,160
with these advisory partners

628
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,480
and then they work long-term together.

629
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,800
So, oftentimes working together

630
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,960
for a year or more.

631
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,640
So, it's a really deep relationship.

632
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,600
We also want to focus on things

633
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,200
that really move the needle

634
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,560
and especially working

635
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,760
with enterprise startups.

636
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,400
The contract sizes for customers

637
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,920
can be so big that if we can help them

638
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,520
get one new client, we've done our job.

639
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,640
So, we do focus a lot

640
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,560
on bridging the corporates in our network

641
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,920
with these portfolio companies

642
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,840
in order to see if there is

643
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,160
any possibility for design partnerships

644
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,320
or for the corporates potential

645
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,560
to become customers ultimately.

646
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
We've done a few

647
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,320
really interesting research reports.

648
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
So, at the start of the pandemic,

649
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
we looked at how covid

650
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,040
was impacting startups from,

651
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,800
how many of them

652
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,200
were changing their product

653
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,000
to doing layoffs.

654
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,360
So, what exactly were

655
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,440
the startup founders thinking of

656
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,000
throughout this time.

657
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,040
We just released last week a report

658
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,060
on enterprise deep tech VC

659
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,960
in Europe and Israel.

660
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,080
So, if anyone's interested

661
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,600
in reading that, it's up on Medium.

662
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,120
Definitely encouraged you to check it out.

663
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,440
And then we're right now

664
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,960
working with Index Ventures,

665
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,840
specifically talking or looking

666
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,520
at how Israeli startups

667
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,680
can successfully expand

668
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,280
to the US market, which is, of course,

669
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,600
top of mind for a lot of founders.

670
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,360
100%. So, before we end,

671
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,360
I have to go back and look at your journey

672
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,400
a little bit more realistically,

673
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,880
because you've gone through

674
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,800
so many different experiences.

675
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,000
A lot of them are

676
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,320
in the same line of thought

677
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,600
of how do we work

678
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,840
with early stage companies

679
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,680
to either help them

680
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,640
break into the US market

681
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,560
or continue to scale and grow.

682
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,920
And I'd love to hear from you

683
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,080
some of the insights

684
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,360
that you've gained throughout the years.

685
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,200
If you were to look back

686
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,880
and talk to a young entrepreneur

687
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,840
or a young person that's going into

688
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,160
the tech scene or any scene,

689
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,080
what are some key things

690
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,040
that they should keep in mind

691
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,960
as they go on their career path?

692
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,680
So, basically, what are some creatives?

693
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,280
Right.

694
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,640
Okay. I have quite a few ideas.

695
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,800
A lot of these

696
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,120
I had to learn the hard way.

697
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,800
And now I get to hear them

698
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,560
the easy way.

699
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,720
So, if this helps one person,

700
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,320
hopefully it's worth what the trials

701
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,720
and tribulations I went through.

702
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,160
So, I would say I have five tips

703
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,440
for people who are in their career

704
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,760
and that for me have been quite valuable.

705
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,040
So, the first is storytelling.

706
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,280
Everything at the end of the day

707
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,440
is about how you can create

708
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,800
an interesting and compelling story.

709
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,600
Whether you're in college

710
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,440
trying to land a job,

711
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,240
you have to create a good story

712
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,040
about why what you've done in the past

713
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,120
is relevant for the company

714
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,040
and why you're value added

715
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,360
to the specific company.

716
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,800
Whether you're a founder,

717
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,760
that's creating a story about

718
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,240
why an investor should invest

719
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,280
in your specific company.

720
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,680
I think storytelling is really important.

721
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,800
For me and my career,

722
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,880
I use storytelling

723
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,120
when I was pivoting out of HR

724
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,560
and went to Facebook.

725
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,280
And the way that I focused on it

726
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,880
was rather than focusing on the fact

727
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,040
that I was an HR, it was like, no,

728
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,720
I was running programming for tech.

729
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,800
Which is very relevant

730
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,360
to running a startup program at Facebook.

731
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,760
And then I would say another thing

732
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,760
that's really important is very few things

733
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,960
are worth being the hill to die on.

734
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,920
I've been guilty of this.

735
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,560
What does that mean?

736
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,240
Yeah. So, basically what that means

737
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,600
is don't ruin professional relationships

738
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,280
trying to prove your point, right?

739
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,840
I've been guilty of this at times,

740
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,240
especially early on in my career,

741
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,720
where it's like

742
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,920
you know the right answer

743
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,720
or you think you know the right answer

744
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,520
and you really want to make sure

745
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,360
the team or your company does it that way.

746
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,960
And it can definitely backfire on you

747
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,240
if you're really holding steady on this.

748
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,600
So, what I do now

749
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,640
is say my thoughts

750
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,280
and what I think we should do.

751
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,400
And if leadership wants to do it, awesome,

752
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,480
if not, fine.

753
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
Just not getting as personally invested.

754
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,840
I will caveat that by saying

755
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,200
there are some things which are worth

756
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,680
being the hill to die on.

757
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,920
I've personally encountered one of them

758
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,800
and it was literally,

759
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,640
"If we don't do this,

760
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,920
I will walk away from the company."

761
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,080
Like that.

762
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,200
So, it does happen occasionally,

763
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,320
but I think ultimately be very mindful

764
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,160
of not ruining your relationships.

765
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,240
Because your teammates,

766
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,680
you have to work with them.

767
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,480
This project is going to be over

768
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,080
at some point soon.

769
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,560
But the teammates, if you're working

770
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
at this company for years,

771
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,880
you have to continue working with them.

772
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,200
So, I think it's really important

773
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,480
to have positive relationships with them.

774
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,560
I have to say regarding that point,

775
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,400
it's so interesting.

776
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,120
I remember, I often reflect back

777
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,080
to my officers academy training,

778
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,000
and I remember that

779
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,480
one of my commanders there,

780
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,240
she give us a talk about our values

781
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,560
and the things that we are

782
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
really passionate about.

783
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,160
And especially in a military setting,

784
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,000
it's often a very interesting balance

785
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,920
between the things that you believe in,

786
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,320
the things that the system believes in,

787
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,880
at the end, you know your role

788
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,160
within an organization.

789
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,080
And it's perhaps it's accelerated

790
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,400
within a military organization

791
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,640
because the thing you're working towards

792
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,520
is different than just

793
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,360
monetary value for the company.

794
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,800
But one of the things she told us is that,

795
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,320
you really have one chance

796
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,920
within an organization to choose something

797
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,040
that is worth fighting for,

798
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,520
Enough that you're saying,

799
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,960
"I'm putting my keys down

800
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,760
and if this is not happening,

801
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,480
I'm walking away."

802
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,080
But you only get to do that once, really.

803
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,960
Because the second time,

804
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,520
and the third time is

805
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,520
it doesn't really work.

806
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,960
So, I definitely,

807
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,280
I haven't used that card yet

808
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,320
in any organization.

809
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,880
But I definitely see.

810
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,160
Anne, 20 minutes go by so fast

811
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,160
and obviously,

812
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,280
there are so many more things

813
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,520
that I can learn from.

814
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,440
But before we leave,

815
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,800
I have to ask you for three words

816
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,600
that you would use to describe yourself.

817
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,240
Yeah, absolutely.

818
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,680
So, I would say

819
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,880
if I had to use three words

820
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,160
to describe myself,

821
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,680
the first is being determined.

822
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,280
So, if I got an idea in my head,

823
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,320
whether it's work or in my personal life,

824
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,240
it will happen.

825
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,560
Like come hell or high water,

826
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,640
I will make it happen.

827
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,000
And so that's it.

828
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,440
Career wise, it's been pretty helpful.

829
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,640
And then I would say,

830
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,160
I tend to be pretty resilient.

831
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,440
There's been a number of times

832
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,560
where I had to face things

833
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,480
that are pretty challenging.

834
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,440
The few times where I had

835
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,160
to completely start from scratch.

836
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,680
When I moved back to New York

837
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,040
after leaving Facebook

838
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,240
I didn't have an apartment,

839
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,600
I was staying at my friend's place,

840
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,840
I didn't have a job,

841
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,880
so completely rebuilding my life

842
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,360
from scratch.

843
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,680
I think it takes a lot of resiliency

844
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,640
to do that and do it well.

845
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,560
And I think a lot of people right now,

846
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,600
everyone needs to be resilient

847
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,120
going through what we're going through

848
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,400
and managing and then

849
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,200
doing it so successfully.

850
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,960
So, I think that

851
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,520
that's a really important skill to have.

852
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,440
And then lastly, I would say kindness.

853
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,160
There's that famous line that goes,

854
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,600
nice guys finish last.

855
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,800
And I think that is absolutely not true.

856
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,200
I think in the short term,

857
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,080
being Machiavellian can pay off.

858
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,280
But long term, it 100% does not pay off

859
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,160
because people will learn that about you

860
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,120
and then they just will not want

861
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,880
to work with you.

862
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,120
So, I think being kind

863
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,200
both personal life and professional life

864
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,120
is 100% the right way.

865
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,040
And it's worked really well for me.

866
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,760
Anne, thank you very very much.

867
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,640
Thanks for being so generous

868
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,320
with your time and for all the inspiration

869
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,920
and insights through all of this.

870
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,760
It was really wonderful.

871
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,640
I had a great time.

872
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,760
Thank you so much for having me.

873
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,240
This is an absolute pleasure.

874
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Of course. Take care.

875
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,500
Stay safe and healthy.

876
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,000
Bye.
