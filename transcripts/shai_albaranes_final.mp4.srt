1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,999
The difference between

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,599
an invention and innovation,

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,959
is that invention is something new.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,759
Innovation is making something

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,700
real and economic out of this invention.

6
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,679
Shai Albaranes,

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,920
thank you for coming

8
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:41,839
to 20 Minute Leaders.

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,320
How are you?

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,440
Thank you very much for having me.

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,600
I'm fine, thank you.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,080
Wonderful.

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,280
I'm extremely excited to have you.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,680
Talking about corporate innovation.

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,760
You're part of a group called Orbia,

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,600
22,000 people,

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,760
yet you're tasked with possibly

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,680
one of the most difficult jobs there.

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,080
How do you take an organization

20
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,480
of tens of thousands of people,

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,560
and bring innovation,

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,480
whether it's bottom up, top down?

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,280
I had the privilege of being both

24
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:12,439
at large organizations like 8200,

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,800
which is a large organization,

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,000
but also part of a startup

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,760
like Hippo, with just 200 people.

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,160
But Shai, before that,

29
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,960
you have to tell me how you started

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,360
by creating a board game.

31
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,160
What's that about?

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,640
Okay.

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,720
So, it was after my army service.

34
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,920
And during the Army service

35
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,120
you feel empowered, you feel important

36
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,600
and you feel great.

37
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,560
And then you finished your army service.

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,520
I was in a combat unit.

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,400
And basically, no one recognizes you

40
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,280
for whatever you did.

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,640
So, when you look for a job,

42
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,480
you start getting all kind

43
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,560
of like lousy jobs.

44
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,000
So, I started one of these lousy jobs

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,320
and I was pretty bored.

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,880
And it happened that it was

47
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,440
the 50th anniversary of Israel.

48
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,000
And a friend of mine and I,

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,640
we said, this must be

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,800
a very, very good business opportunity.

51
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,440
So, we started thinking,

52
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,200
what how can we make a business

53
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,560
out of this big event

54
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,640
in the history of Israel,

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,800
50 years of Israel.

56
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,120
And to make a long story short,

57
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,080
we screened a few ideas,

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,680
but we came up with this idea

59
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,960
that people don't know

60
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,040
or kids do not know

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,920
the history of Israel.

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,560
If we can teach them

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,640
in a very fun way,

64
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,040
the basics about the history of Israel,

65
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,520
the leader of the peace agreement,

66
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,160
the war, or the sporting events,

67
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,200
that will be great.

68
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,960
So, this is what we did.

69
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,360
I have to say that I love that.

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,320
I love that because

71
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,160
like a lot of other kids,

72
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,080
I grew up not really learning

73
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,960
the history of Israel.

74
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,560
When I was about to go to

75
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,240
the Officers Academy to [--],

76
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,160
I got a book that was this thick

77
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,400
that I had to now

78
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,600
within about 24 hours,

79
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,120
memorized the whole thing.

80
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,960
And I wish I had a game like that

81
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,120
when I was just starting out.

82
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,760
But walk me through

83
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,640
your journey from there,

84
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,840
because you've done quite a few

85
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,280
fascinating things leading up

86
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:07,599
to corporate innovation.

87
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,199
A lot of them are really tangled.

88
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,239
You have McKinsey in there,

89
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,800
you have Netafim in there.

90
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,080
Talk to me a little bit about,

91
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,120
about your process up to today.

92
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:17,119
Yes.

93
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,839
So, I think the funny thing is that

94
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,839
now looking 20 years back,

95
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,680
there is kind of like a line,

96
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,400
a thread connecting all these things.

97
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,160
But when I was doing each one of these,

98
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,920
it didn't seem like there is a story.

99
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,600
So, as I said,

100
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,040
my first real business experience

101
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,880
was this startup company

102
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,480
that developed the board game

103
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,000
for the kids.

104
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,680
And then I said, okay,

105
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,440
I need to get a technology education.

106
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,240
So, I went to do

107
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,280
a computer science degree in the IDC.

108
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,040
And I was very, very fortunate

109
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,760
to be accepted

110
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,000
to the Zell program in the IDC.

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,880
Yeah.

112
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,520
And this was the first year

113
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,280
of the Zell program, right?

114
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,120
The very first year?

115
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,280
So, you were in it with Assaf?

116
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,480
Yes.

117
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,200
This is how I know Assaf very well.

118
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,800
This is how you know Assaf, my boss.

119
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Amazing. Okay.

120
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,240
Exactly. Exactly.

121
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,320
And we were actually

122
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,200
in a very small study group

123
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,600
where we did a consulting project

124
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,880
to a big company in Israel.

125
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,120
We became good friends.

126
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,360
And yeah, this is how I know Assaf.

127
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,560
Now things are coming together.

128
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,640
He also went to McKinsey.

129
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,320
Okay. Great. Wonderful.

130
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,040
Yeah.

131
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
So, what happens after Zell?

132
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,960
So, I did Zell.

133
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,280
And what I understood

134
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,360
that I love technology,

135
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,400
but I like the business side

136
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,600
of technology.

137
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,480
I couldn't program like it was,

138
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,000
I got bored.

139
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,439
So, then I worked

140
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,880
for a few startup companies,

141
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,280
mainly in business development

142
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,560
and marketing.

143
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,680
So, you could say that the first,

144
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,600
you know, 8, 9 years were kind of like

145
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,760
an entrepreneurial type of experience.

146
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,880
I do my own start up

147
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,040
or other people start ups.

148
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,440
And then in 2007,

149
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,320
I said, okay, I want to jump

150
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,560
to the adult pool,

151
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,440
you know, the big boys pool.

152
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,160
And by the way, that's another,

153
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,680
maybe Assaf even doesn't know about it,

154
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,720
but when we were in Zell,

155
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,880
he was starting to talk

156
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,120
about doing an MBA

157
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,280
in Stanford and in Chicago.

158
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,480
And I said, "Really?"

159
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,640
It never even crossed my mind.

160
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,680
But then I said, okay,

161
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,560
if he talks about it, it makes sense.

162
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:35,480
Let me dig into that.

163
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,040
So, I dug into that a few years later

164
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,360
and I understood that I want to do it

165
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,200
and I can do it.

166
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,080
So, I went to do my MBA at INSEAD,

167
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,440
which was a great experience.

168
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,120
And then I said, okay,

169
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,280
this was nice.

170
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,880
But the real business school

171
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,320
of the world is consulting.

172
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,240
So, I joined McKinsey.

173
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,800
And I did that for a few years

174
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,880
in London and in Israel.

175
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,480
Wow.

176
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,680
And then in 2012,

177
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,080
there was a very interesting opportunity

178
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,240
to join Netafim.

179
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,080
Netafim is an Israeli born company

180
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,840
and today's the largest

181
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,560
irrigation company in the world.

182
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,160
Probably some people know about it.

183
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,520
In the world?

184
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,560
I had no idea.

185
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,320
I knew it was a miracle.

186
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,720
It's one of Israel's early miracles,

187
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,040
but I wasn't aware

188
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,760
that it's the biggest irrigation company

189
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,200
in the world.

190
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:25,760
It is.

191
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,120
It's now more than billion dollars

192
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,720
in revenue.

193
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,200
And it's the largest irrigation company

194
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,840
in the world. Yeah.

195
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,240
Wow.

196
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,960
And do you mind sharing just in two words

197
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,640
the back story of Netafim?

198
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,080
Why it was innovation through necessity?

199
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,280
Because I get so inspired

200
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,120
every time I understand that

201
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,440
why it even happened.

202
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,760
It happened, again, like you said,

203
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,920
out of necessity.

204
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,080
So, people were looking

205
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,840
to grow stuff in the desert.

206
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,120
In the desert.

207
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,000
Because we had to.

208
00:06:59,280 --> 00:06:59,600
Yeah.

209
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:00,399
Because you know,

210
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,080
a big chunk of Israel land

211
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,440
is a desert.

212
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,360
And people were sent

213
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,000
to inhabit to the desert.

214
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So, the Netafim were founded

215
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,040
by one of the kibbutz in Israel,

216
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,760
Kibbutz Hatzerim.

217
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,920
Because they needed a way

218
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,720
to cultivate the desert

219
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,680
and they needed a job for the elderly

220
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,240
that couldn't go work outside.

221
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,040
But they needed to do something indoor.

222
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,680
Right?

223
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,880
So, they partner with an engineer

224
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,720
who came up with the

225
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,760
original drip concept,

226
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,080
and they launched Netafim.

227
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:35,679
And, you know,

228
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,040
60 something years later,

229
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
it is the largest

230
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,200
irrigation company in the world.

231
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,400
It's remarkable to me

232
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,880
to think that we have an Israeli company

233
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,440
that is 60 something years old.

234
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,360
But you're in Netafim,

235
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,840
you're working there really

236
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,280
with the leadership.

237
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,960
How do you get enticed

238
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,560
by this idea of innovation?

239
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,640
Because already Netafim

240
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,560
is a big organization,

241
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,800
but then you also transition to Orbia

242
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,320
and there you are literally,

243
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:02,719
you're tasked with leading innovation.

244
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,240
So, how does that come about?

245
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,640
Okay.

246
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,920
So, just to close the story,

247
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,400
Netafim, I did various positions,

248
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,640
the last one I was managing

249
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,120
the company product portfolio.

250
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:15,959
So, we were constantly thinking,

251
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,079
what is it that we can innovate.

252
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,759
Right?

253
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,960
Right.

254
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,280
A billion dollar portfolio. Right?

255
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,120
Yes. Yes.

256
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,080
And then, you know,

257
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,520
for me, it was a big,

258
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,159
a combination of a couple of things

259
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,120
in early 2018

260
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,840
when Orbia acquired Netafim.

261
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,360
And Orbia is a very large public company.

262
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
A multinational seven billion dollars

263
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,120
in revenues.

264
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,200
So, they acquired Netafim in 2018.

265
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,240
And the other thing that happened

266
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,840
in the same very month,

267
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,880
a new CEO came to Orbia.

268
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,680
A guy called Daniel Martinez,

269
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,720
and he started a very, very

270
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,720
ambitious transformation program.

271
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,600
And he knew that innovation

272
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,000
is a significant pillar

273
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,760
of that transformation.

274
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,720
So, he was looking for someone

275
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,280
to lead the innovation activities

276
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,120
in inside Orbia.

277
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,000
So, he pulled me out of Netafim

278
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,840
and put me as part of the

279
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,320
Orbia management team and told me,

280
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,840
"Corporate innovation. Go build it."

281
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,360
So, before we continue to talk about

282
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,440
exactly what you did there,

283
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,960
when I hear the word innovation,

284
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,800
a lot of people today

285
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:35,559
to hear innovation,

286
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,080
it's a little bit of a fluffy word.

287
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,520
Yes, we innovate this.

288
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,840
It's like a when a startup says

289
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,680
we revolutionize this. Right?

290
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,080
What is innovation in its core

291
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,400
that this new CEO said,

292
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,720
I need a figure that can come in

293
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,320
and help us do it properly, within Orbia?

294
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,280
Right.

295
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,720
So, there are multiple dimensions

296
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:01,039
to that answer.

297
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,120
I'll walk you like briefly,

298
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,880
let me know if you want me

299
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,040
to dig into any one of these.

300
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,600
Okay?

301
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,040
Wonderful.

302
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,400
So, the first thing was to define,

303
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,560
what is innovation, right?

304
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,520
For us, because innovation in a startup

305
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,120
is completely different than innovation

306
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,800
in a large multinational.

307
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,000
Right?

308
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,560
And I spend maybe the first six months

309
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,360
doing a lot of research.

310
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,400
But what does it mean,

311
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,320
innovation in the corporate world?

312
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,480
And I met startups

313
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,280
and VCs and incubators

314
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,840
and accelerators and academia

315
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,120
and I read thousands of books

316
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,040
and articles and in order

317
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,120
to be able to clarify

318
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,440
what is it we want to do. Right?

319
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,879
So, the first thing was a

320
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,119
relatively simple definition

321
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,799
that everybody will understand.

322
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,279
It doesn't mean that it's perfect,

323
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,959
but something that

324
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,439
everybody can connect to.

325
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,719
So, internally, we define innovation

326
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,960
as creating something new

327
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,920
that addresses a need.

328
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,080
And, this is the important part,

329
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,880
the economic value that it will generate

330
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,080
is higher than the cost

331
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,560
of developing it. Right?

332
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,880
Why is that important?

333
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,800
Why is that an important piece

334
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
of the puzzle?

335
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,760
It's an important piece because

336
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,000
you might know that 95 or so percent

337
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,240
of the global IP or patents

338
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,920
that are being created

339
00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:26,479
are never commercialized.

340
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,519
Right?

341
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,639
95%?

342
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,479
Yeah.

343
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,839
So, the difference between

344
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,479
an invention and innovation

345
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,839
is that invention is something new.

346
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,519
Innovation is making something real

347
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,239
and economic out of this invention.

348
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,559
Right?

349
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,880
I've never thought of it that way.

350
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,680
So, the innovation

351
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,840
is different than creativity.

352
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,720
It's different than invention.

353
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,320
Because, as we said,

354
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,400
95% of the invention

355
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,160
are never commercialized.

356
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,360
Not because they're not novel,

357
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
but because there's no economic value.

358
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,520
Right?

359
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,680
So, this is how we define it.

360
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,840
And then, the second step was

361
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,960
to understand that innovation

362
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,480
Is actually not a single term

363
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,360
and there are different types

364
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,000
of innovation.

365
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
Right?

366
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,600
Your audience can read about it.

367
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,360
But I'll give you

368
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,000
just the one sentence.

369
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,520
There are multiple frameworks

370
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,080
to think about

371
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,000
the types of innovation.

372
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,760
But the classic one

373
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
that people usually use

374
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,280
is the difference between

375
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,719
core, adjacent,

376
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,360
and transformative innovation.

377
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,240
And we don't need to spend more

378
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,000
a lot of time on that.

379
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,560
But just to understand that there are

380
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,480
different levels of complexity

381
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,080
in innovation

382
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,440
There are some things that are closer

383
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,240
to your current capabilities, the core.

384
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,080
And there are innovation

385
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,720
that relates to new capabilities,

386
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,080
new customers, new markets

387
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,840
that you want to develop,

388
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,160
and this is more transformative.

389
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Anything in between.

390
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,240
And it is critical

391
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,800
as an organization, not a startup,

392
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,560
a startup can focus

393
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,160
on one specific innovation.

394
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,040
Right?

395
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,960
But as a corporate,

396
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,240
you need to invest in all

397
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,280
of these three dimensions.

398
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,520
Right?

399
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,280
Right.

400
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,880
It's an important understanding.

401
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,360
So, this was a realization

402
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:15,240
number two. Okay?

403
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,199
Realization number three

404
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,759
was about the fact

405
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,799
that innovation, again,

406
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,959
in the context of a corporate world

407
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,559
is not an activity, it's a portfolio.

408
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,599
So, if you think about, you know,

409
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,960
you're an angel investor, right?

410
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,160
If you invest in one company,

411
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:33,759
you have 90% chances to fail.

412
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,279
But if you invest in 30,

413
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,719
you have a certain probability

414
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,480
that you can out of the entire portfolio,

415
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:42,359
will make a profit, right?

416
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,559
Right.

417
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,679
And this is exactly the same way

418
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,599
to think about innovation.

419
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,079
It's a portfolio of activities.

420
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,399
Some of them will fail,

421
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,280
some of them will succeed.

422
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,440
But you want to think about

423
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,960
the entire portfolio

424
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,200
and that it progresses towards

425
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,480
the goals that you want to achieve.

426
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,960
So, this was realization number three.

427
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,600
And realization number four

428
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,000
is about the time horizon.

429
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,600
You want to invest in activities

430
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,640
in that portfolio.

431
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:09,119
Some of them are short term.

432
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,080
Some of them are medium term.

433
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,560
And some of them

434
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,960
will pay out 7, 10 years out.

435
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,560
This is if you want

436
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,160
to kind of like the thing

437
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,840
that I understood in the research,

438
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:24,639
like the four principles, if you wish,

439
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,520
this is what I understood

440
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,000
in the research.

441
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And in the past two years

442
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,639
were trying to implement all of that

443
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,199
and building the processes,

444
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,679
the infrastructure,

445
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,040
the management and all of that.

446
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:37,479
Which, by the way,

447
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,720
that's another important thing.

448
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,079
Many people think about innovation

449
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,760
is kind of like a project, an initiative,

450
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,720
but it's important to understand

451
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,800
that if you really want

452
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,920
to be successful in innovation,

453
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,000
you have to think about it

454
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
as a corporate function.

455
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,880
Like finance, like marketing,

456
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,040
like IT, like R&D.

457
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,240
You know, you have processes,

458
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,960
you have ton of development,

459
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,600
you have succession plans,

460
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,920
you have budget,

461
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,680
you have annual targets.

462
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,160
You know, it's a corporate function

463
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,400
like any other function.

464
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,800
If you don't manage it this way,

465
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,560
it will never succeed.

466
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,680
Right.

467
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,640
Now, I'm particularly interested

468
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,720
in what you were saying before

469
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
about the innovation,

470
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,880
really to manage innovation,

471
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,400
you're not managing a single project

472
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,800
because you will never invest

473
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,320
in a single company and say,

474
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,440
I'm putting all my eggs in this basket.

475
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,360
You manage a portfolio

476
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,480
of innovative solutions

477
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,760
that most of them will fail,

478
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,840
but you expect that of the whole basket,

479
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,040
you'll see some profit

480
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,520
or some greatness for the company.

481
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,640
And I keep thinking

482
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,680
to all these occurrences where

483
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,880
I'm hearing about my friends

484
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,200
who may be going

485
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,760
to their managers or their bosses

486
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,000
and suggesting some innovative project.

487
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,200
And the answer is always no,

488
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,600
because this is

489
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,040
not likely to succeed.

490
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,080
But I can't help but wonder

491
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,280
whether their managers

492
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,680
are thinking strategically about,

493
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,240
okay, what if we just take a pool

494
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,280
of these innovative projects,

495
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,040
if we can allow ourselves to.

496
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,840
And then allow for

497
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,880
the real innovation to happen.

498
00:16:07,881 --> 00:16:10,119
But Shai, how do you actually tangibly

499
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,560
go into an organization

500
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,240
that is 22,000 people

501
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,360
and encourage innovation?

502
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,880
Because I'm guessing

503
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,000
that you're not hiring people

504
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,760
to just do innovative things.

505
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:20,639
You're trying to encourage innovation

506
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,959
internally within

507
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,400
the core of the company.

508
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,680
Right?

509
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,880
Yeah.

510
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,120
So, I think, what I'll share with you

511
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,040
are the six current programs

512
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,519
that we have under the umbrella

513
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,360
of corporate innovation,

514
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,360
and this will make it

515
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,920
a little bit clearer.

516
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,200
Okay?

517
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
First and foremost,

518
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,560
before we talk about the six programs,

519
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,200
if the CEO and the senior leadership

520
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,600
do not think it's a top priority,

521
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,400
it will never succeed.

522
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,040
And I'm fortunate

523
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,000
to have a very, very

524
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,840
visionary, future thinking

525
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,160
and also a very, very humble

526
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,520
and truly great person as my CEO.

527
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,720
Right?

528
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,719
Without that, I could never embark

529
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,440
on the journey.

530
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,960
And also the entire management of Orbia,

531
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,600
which, by the way,

532
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,840
all of them other than one

533
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,000
are new since the last two years.

534
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,840
Right?

535
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,680
And really international,

536
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,000
but within the corporate innovation,

537
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,160
so, we have six programs.

538
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,200
One, we have Orbia Ventures,

539
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,120
which is the corporate

540
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,600
venture capital fund of Orbia.

541
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,240
With $130M that we invest

542
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,840
in startups that are strategic

543
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,720
to anyone of our five businesses.

544
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,560
Then we have

545
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,280
a startup partnership program

546
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,400
where we want to take,

547
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,800
products or services developed

548
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,040
by startup companies

549
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,920
and expand our offering

550
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,080
through a commercial partnership.

551
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,920
We have an advanced analytic program,

552
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,160
which we started three months ago,

553
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,480
to deploy advanced technologies

554
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,720
like AI machine learning

555
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,280
into the activity that we do.

556
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,160
We have a program

557
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,560
called, Orbia Lighthouse.

558
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,960
This is actually, the official definition

559
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,080
is a Venture Studio.

560
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,840
Again, it's a new term in innovation.

561
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,040
People can dig it up.

562
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,600
But Innovation Studio is kind of like

563
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,840
an internal incubator.

564
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,200
Like we launch new digital ventures

565
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,080
or new startups.

566
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,280
But everything is managed internally.

567
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,800
The budget, the exploration,

568
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,000
the EIR recruiting,

569
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,160
everything is internal.

570
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,600
The 5th program

571
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,880
is what we call Launchpad,

572
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,600
it's an internal innovation program

573
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,400
where every person in the organization

574
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
can participate in innovation.

575
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,320
And how do we coach them

576
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,240
and how do we train them

577
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,440
and how we give them budget to pilot.

578
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,600
And we only have eight of those projects

579
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,240
in the implementation already.

580
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,360
Right?

581
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,480
So, this Launchpad,

582
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,920
are these employees

583
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,600
that can come and say,

584
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
I have an idea that I want

585
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,200
to explore within Orbia.

586
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,800
So, I want to take some time

587
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,640
to explore the city.

588
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,880
Because obviously they have a team

589
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,080
that they're working for.

590
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,760
So, how does it actually work?

591
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:03,839
Because this is where

592
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,080
the constraint is, right?

593
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,280
They have their daily job.

594
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,760
They have their KPIs

595
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,960
that they have to meet.

596
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,680
Yet they're saying,

597
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,600
but I also want to spend

598
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,560
some time innovating.

599
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,440
Yeah. So, the way that it works,

600
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,400
we don't carve out people

601
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,440
out of their day to day.

602
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,040
They need to do it

603
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,880
on top of their day to day.

604
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,320
Okay?

605
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,200
There is a recognition,

606
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,160
there is an understanding,

607
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,760
and there is clarity

608
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,640
from the top management

609
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,840
that once a certain idea move into

610
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,200
what we call funded experiments ,

611
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,240
so, we give them pilot

612
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:35,880
and we give them money

613
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,080
to experiment. Okay?

614
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,840
Then they can spend, you know,

615
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,480
10, 20% of their time on that.

616
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,080
But all the way through, you know,

617
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,120
developing the idea,

618
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,360
asking what is the problem,

619
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,360
asking what could be the solution,

620
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,600
going through the different stages

621
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,240
of the screening,

622
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,280
it's all on top

623
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,600
of their day to day job.

624
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:55,800
Right?

625
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,320
But we give them all the coaching.

626
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,240
We teach them about clean start up.

627
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,520
We bring people that can coach

628
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,120
the guys and help them succeed.

629
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,400
So, but it's on top of their day job.

630
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,720
It's not a carve-out activity.

631
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,720
Okay. Okay.

632
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,800
The last piece in the puzzle

633
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,280
is circular economy.

634
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,160
It's a huge domain

635
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,240
and we can talk about it for hours.

636
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,800
But basically

637
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,720
it's how do we become

638
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,520
I mean, Orbia,

639
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,960
how can we become more circular.

640
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,200
How can we make profit, but also do it

641
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,320
in a positive contribution to the planet.

642
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,480
Right?

643
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,200
I love that.

644
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,400
So, it sounds like you're

645
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,520
a venture capitalist.

646
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,960
You're a startup adviser.

647
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,520
You're helping drive

648
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,560
the company forward,

649
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,480
but you're also making the world

650
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,360
a better place.

651
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,920
So, Shai, expect that a lot of people

652
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,960
are going to be very jealous

653
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,400
after they listen to this talk.

654
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,320
But this is extremely inspiring.

655
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,800
And I'm definitely taking

656
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,400
a lot of lessons moving forward

657
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,520
to whatever ventures

658
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,040
I'll start on my own.

659
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,960
But before we go, Shai,

660
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,640
I have to ask you

661
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,680
the most important question,

662
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,920
which is three words

663
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,560
that you would use to describe yourself.

664
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:06,320
Yeah. Okay.

665
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,440
It's funny because in the process

666
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,680
and it kept me awake

667
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,640
a little bit last night,

668
00:21:11,641 --> 00:21:12,799
you know, the question.

669
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,319
Because it's a good question.

670
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,480
And I also asked my wife,

671
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,320
what does she think.

672
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,280
So, if it's okay with you,

673
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,480
I'll tell you what she said

674
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,560
and I'll tell you what I think.

675
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,320
Okay?

676
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,560
Three words that describe me.

677
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,520
So, she said,

678
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,200
ambitious,

679
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,000
a leader, and high standards.

680
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:30,039
High standards, it's two words,

681
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,760
but, okay.

682
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,480
There's a hyphen.

683
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,679
Yeah.

684
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,879
And before I asked her,

685
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,079
I thought, you know,

686
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,319
what would I say about myself.

687
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,440
And I said,

688
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,800
curiosity, perseverance and growth.

689
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,440
I love it.

690
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,600
Curiosity, perseverance and growth.

691
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,600
I think that all six words match.

692
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,480
Shai, thank you very, very much.

693
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,920
This is just wonderful.

694
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,720
Thank you for being on the show.

695
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,880
Thank you. Take care.
