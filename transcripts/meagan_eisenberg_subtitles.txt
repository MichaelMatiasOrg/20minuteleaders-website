Meagan Eisenberg, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? I'm doing well. Thank you. Thank you for being here. So, you're so so busy. I mean, just the track that you've done and the things that you're doing now with TripActions, a company that I love so much, as the chief marketing officer. And previously the chief marketing officer of MongoDB. And Vice President of Docusign. So, a really fascinating things. And what I'd love to talk about for the next 20 minutes, is to hear a little bit about your journey and about the role of the CMO. And how you've watched different companies scale their marketing efforts through time. So, Meagan, maybe you can give me a little bit of background about who you are and why are you so passionate about marketing. Yeah. Since business school, I went to undergrad. It was MIS computer science, but I pivoted to business during business school to marketing for tech companies. And I haven't looked back. I love it. It definitely I have picked up skills along the way. Started out in product marketing. Switched over to really lead generation, demand generation. Understanding what it takes to build a pipeline for your sales team. And then more recently, as a CMO. Learning more on the brand building corporate communications. And I think, when you look at companies at scale and when you come into a company, there's three things I'm trying to figure out that I need to focus on between hiring the right people. Because the scale you need, the right skill set and marketing has a lot of functions that are very different. Whether it's product marketing, corporate marketing, dimension growth, web systems, operations, and then localization for Europe and Asia. So, people's number one. Process, making sure you have the right process around launches, partnering with your sales team, lead flow and then technology. We have over 25 different technologies. And about every company I have entered, whether it was DocuSign, MongoDB or TripActions, I brought in a lot of martech and complemented that with a lot of salestech and partnering. And that's where you get a lot of insights and data. And you can compete in the market when you know what's going on. And new technology helps us innovate. That's why we buy software that gives us a competitive advantage. That's why I love working at tech companies. Because you really can take markets better when you have information and you know what's working and what's not working. So, talk to me a little bit about this notion of lead generation. Why is this such a difficult and complicated subject? Because to an average engineer coming into the world of marketing, you say, "Okay. Well, I've built a great product." "I have a landing page." "I can put some ads somewhere." And, yeah, everybody will just flock to my products. It should be pretty easy. But I guess it's not. Yeah. When it comes to scale, that's getting to the masses. And the masses don't always find products the same way. Sometimes they read about it. Sometimes a friend tells them about it. Sometimes they see it on social media. Sometimes you email them. Sometimes they're in at an event when we used to do events. And so, you've got to figure out the persona you're targeting that's most likely to buy your product and get in front of them. So, they're aware of you and then they take an action. And so, marketing job is to understand who the buyer is. Why they buy you. And then get in front of them. You're fishing out in a big ocean. So, you've got to figure out where the fish are. You have to have the right bait. And then you've got to bring them in and hand them off to sales to close them. And is that the same process when you're a 20 person company and when you're a 200 person companies? Is it the same sort of pipelines for trying to get sales? No, it's not. It's the same idea that you need to understand the persona you're targeting. But when you're a 20 person company that's hand-to-hand combat. That is, who do you know, and your network that can get you help you get introduced into the first five,10, 20 companies that become customers. And so, it's very targeted. Direct relationships. Usually have someone in best ever sales who's got these relationships with that target audience. Whether it's IT or finance or HR or whatever, depending on who you're selling to. And you get in and you solve problems. And you're still trying to figure out product market fit in the beginning. So, it's hard to scale until you know what is the core reason people are buying you. And you don't really know that when you're a 20 person company. You might get some bluebirds. You might get some stuff. But ultimately, the product's going to pivot and shift around until you lock on something that many people want to buy. And you don't really know that in the early stage. But how do you even go about finding that persona? Because, so it's fine. So, I have a few thousand people that I know have purchased the product. I know that they're using it. I might be able to even have analytics into their actual usage patterns. But how do you actually feel comfortable and confident writing down who are the top promoters or the champions of this product? Yeah. I mean, who bought it is the first one who signed the deal. If you have that many customers, go and talk to the admin or the manager. Understand and really ask in about five to six questions, you can find out why they bought it. And keep digging in. And then ask your sales team. They're going to know, right? Often they know who they want to talk to because they have a successful pattern of the messaging and what it resonates with. So, talk to your best sales rep. Who do they want to talk to ultimately. And then talk to your customers. Why did they buy. Who's the owner of the product. What was the pain they felt. Is it a HR pain. Is it a finance pain Is it a marketing pain. Depending on why they bought your software, there's pain there that you're solving for them. And that's going to be the target audience. Right. So, within the companies that you've got to be in and from your understanding of the arena, at what point do the sales start to impact dramatically the progression of the product? So, at what point in the company do the sales now come in and they're actually becoming the product people? Because they are starting to know the needs of the customers just as well as the product managers that initially designed the product. I mean, I think if you've had a lot of a bats, a lot of conversations, a lot of demos, failures and successes, you start to get very familiar with the product. But when you're scaling, you often bring a net new reps who don't know the industry. They're just good at selling. So, it's your job in product marketing and sales enablement to train them. Or to bring in sales engineers that really deeply understand the industry and the product to help support them and answer those questions that they haven't brought up. To speed on the part of market sales is to get your reps to be productive. And part of being productive is really knowing. So, there's sales training, there's ramping, there's a knowledge base you've got to transfer. And the faster you can do that, the better you're going to do in sales. Right. Right. That makes a lot of sense. Now, one of the things that you touched upon before was this whole notion of using technology to leverage better sales and better understanding of what's happening. So, what's happening today in 2020 that maybe wasn't available 15 years ago in the arena of marketing? Or even 10 years ago? I saw the talk you gave seven years ago in 2013 on YouTube. You were talking about this whole idea of automated marketing. Right? And understanding your customers. And I was just thinking like, wow. How much has changed in the past seven years that you were talking about back then, and now, we're in 2020? Yeah. I mean, they always say half of marketing spend is effective. You just don't know which half. Well, since then we have a lot of software that gives us attribution information. You've got things like Visible. You've got things like Full Circle CRM. You've got tools that allow you to analyze the workflow. And on the sale side, things we didn't have, we have recordings from chorus.ai and other vendors in the space that analyze what's talked about, how to respond. You can see what they're talking about, what the points are, what the customer brings up. So, I can see how I need to better train reps. Content they need. Customer stories they may or may not have. Your website. I mean, the whole thing. Most people will go to your website at some point. 98% of all people go to your website. But if you don't know who's there and what they're doing on it, that's something you didn't know 15 years ago. But now we know who's on our website. We know what they're doing. How long they sit there. What assets matter. What helps them convert. Are they going to the demo. Are they not. And we move things around and say, "Oh, that captured a lot more people." My job is not only to get people to the website. But to capture them and get them into active conversation. Even to schedule a calendar. We use Chili Piper. They come, they say they want a demo. Why wait for someone to call back to schedule the demo. They can open up their calendar and automatically schedule it between the STR and the customer or the prospect. Right. So, like, take out all the middleman stuff. That's what we're doing. Ads. You spend a lot of money on paid search. We now have something like things like Terminus. They only show ads to our target accounts. Why waste money on companies you don't want to target. So, these technologies are making us, giving us a lot more insightful information so we see what's working and what's not. So, we can be more efficient on our budget. And they help us target who we want to speak to. That is the right personas, the right companies, that sales who wants to get in front of and then streamlines the actual demo. Getting them in front and then process. And then are they effective when they're in front of them. There's so many things available today that we certainly didn't have before. And that's what makes it fun, too. I think it's a competitive advantage to understand the technology landscape out there and what you can use to best your competitors. Because you just have more information. You can move faster than them and you can automate stuff. Even companies have been working on that. So, is this something that's now new within companies? That there are new divisions, there are are new rules for people who are more on marketing analytics and leveraging all of these technologies to be able to then guide the sales representatives or the chief marketing officer on what the strategy should be? Yeah. I mean, there's definitely more technology focused folks in marketing. I think when you're 20 person company, a lot of times your engineering team is also doing your website. But as you mature, you should bring in a dedicated web developer, front end, full stack. So, you can quickly learn, pivot and edit. And it's a living, breathing site. It's really your lifeline for your reps to get a funnel going. And so, I think as soon as you can bring in that team, when you're large enough, that's going to be a much more effective channel than having to wait for sprint, for the engineering team to make edits or even outsource it to a consulting firm to do it. They're not living and breathing the day to day. They're not working the 15 hour days and the weekends with you. Right. They're charging you for every hour and you get so many a day and it takes a while for them to respond. In the beginning, you need to be agile, responsive. You want people that own a part of the company that are working really hard to build it. You want that. I find it much better to have them in-house. Yeah. Definitely. I mean, it makes it just runs much faster and much more flexible. But are things going to change dramatically now in the way of selling B2B as a result of the new social norms due to covid? Because, when I imagine sales, the classic sales, I imagine somebody coming in with a suit, taking a few people out to dinner, maybe a Broadway show, pitching to them throughout the evening and then with drinks signing a deal. I'm imagining that it's a little bit different in software B2B. But are things changing at all due to the covid situation? I mean, of course, things have changed in the short term. I don't think that's a long term. I mean, there's an Oxford study for every dollar spent on travel and going in-person meetings, you return $12 in revenue. Companies are definitely taking a hit. It's hard to build a relationship over a virtual conference. People will get back to meet in person. C-level execs will travel. As soon as you're in a deal cycle, or you're about to lose a customer to a competitor, I guarantee you're going to get on a plane and go fly. Especially if you have a big time customer to me, you're not going to wait for that. And, if we progress, and we have vaccines come out, I see us, we have customers already traveling. So, there's industries, health care, retail, manufacturing, they're all out on the road traveling. Tech is sitting a little bit back on the sidelines, because I think we're tech savvy and we're all over the technologies that are out there. But folks are out there traveling. In the spring, even maybe winter, if vaccines start coming out and the comfort level goes up, and we have more and more knowledge every day, people will get back to traveling. Maybe it's 50%. And the next year, maybe it's a year and a half to two where it's back to full. But I have no doubt people are traveling. We have consumers out traveling right now. I've already done a trip to the East Coast and back in June with my family for vacation. Like there some of us who have been on the road that we're comfortable. We understand our risk. We protect ourselves. We wear masks. We wash hands and all of that. So, that's just growing. People are not going to stay in their houses forever. Human nature, we're just. And we have way more advances than people did 100 years ago when pandemics and plagues and everything else hit. So, yeah, it sucks in the short term. And it's hard to sell. I've no doubt it's a much harder job. And if you're a relationship salesperson that does the dinners and bonds and breaks bread and all of that, you've got a lock down on your value prop better than ever. Your ROI, your customer case studies, proof points. For sure, value proposition and messaging matter more than ever. But we will get back to the relationship side. Because people want to work with people, buy from people. And you trust someone that you've sat down with and gotten to know much more than the cues you miss out on over video. Of course. Of course. That just leaves me optimistic after this conversation. So, thank you for that, first of all. But I also want to talk a little bit about you're a protagonist for a Stanford Business School case study over MongoDB. I've been really enjoying taking some of those classes. And every time we read the case study, they're so fascinating and it's remarkable. And I can't believe you were a protagonist in one of those case studies. So, talk to me a little bit about that and what that was about. Yes. So, that was MongoDB. It was when we scaled. When Carlos and I joined, we had less than 400 people at the company. Grew it to about 1,300. Took it public. But we had took the marketing team from 24 people, almost up to 80. Put in a lot of different technologies. Launched a whole new database as a service atlas, which is a totally different business model than our enterprise product with MongoDB. And really just bringing in, we had to bring in the right people. We had to bring the right technology. The right process to scale the company become a public company that's doing quite well in the markets today even. And so, just all the learnings of that and how you build that partnership. The case is a lot around the partnership between marketing and sales, the communications, transparency and results that we were seeing, a feedback loop. And it's ever evolving because the market's evolving. The customers you go after are evolving. And you need to just keep partnering. I would say it's like a marriage. You've got to communicate. You've got to deliver value. So, that's the main lesson from that case studies. About communication and about continuously evolving within the organization? Well, it's also about the technology we implemented, that we needed. It's about the process that we put in place. The methodologies. How we built out a funnel, fully evolving funnel, all of that. I love it. Okay, Megan, I'd love to use the last just four minutes that we have to talk a little bit about you and why you're doing what you're doing. So, one of the things that I love hearing about and gaining so much inspiration from is where people's passions lie. So, why marketing? Why chief marketing officer of a hypergrowth company, a unicorn? Why that specific position? I think marketing is always changing really hard. I think people think it's events and billboards. And it's not. It's actually a mix of art and science. It's you're dealing with people. You're supporting and enabling a sales team. And they are forever changing your understanding of a customer that's evolving. You've got technical people on your team to do your website, to do operations. You've got product marketers who are creating messaging and positioning. You've got brand and corporate communications. You're dealing with press and media. You've got to do this worldwide. So, you have European folks. That localization in Asia. And so, I always say, marketing is like the circus. When you go and you put up the plates and they're spinning, and you start on one side and you start spinning it, and you get all the way around and then this one starts to fall down. And the idea is to keep it up on the post. So, I always feel like no matter what, once I get something going, when I turn this way, all of a sudden it starts to fall over here. And so, for me, it's just it's never the same. It's changing. You launch new products. You have new players. And so, I find it exciting. And I love the creative side of it. I think brand is fun. What you have to do to get people's attention. It's hard. There's a lot of noisy stuff going on. Every channel is noisy. And then you find a new channel, you understand it, learn it, and then a bunch of players come in and crowd it. And so, it keeps you up on the what's out there, what's the technology. I always think about how I buy. What gets my attention and then how do I apply that to my business. And so, I love it. I think it's very hard, but it's stimulating. So, what's the one or two things that you do to remain updated? Because you keep talking about this idea of evolution and being able to be on top of the game and being at the forefront. How do you personally do that? Because today there's so many startups in this domain. So many different advances. Yeah. I mean, I I've advised a lot of companies. So, over 25 companies. That's one way I keep up on what's going on. Because they have limited budgets and their growth hacking. And I get a lot of ideas and see a lot of things that you could do without a lot of money. Two, I have a pretty good network with other heads of marketing, and VPs of Marketing and CMOs. So, I exchange ideas with them all the time. There's a lot of office hours and networking going on there. And then, I'm constantly following consumer brands. I mean, how did that person get my attention. Whether it's in retail, whether it's in activities, things for my kids. I have three daughters, so, they're active on TikTok and YouTube and all those things. I don't want them to be on that they love. And so, they're always giving me ideas. And so, it's a mix of things that you see and hear. And then I have a team, right? I have a team of almost 30 people that are always coming up with new ideas that have different experiences. And I'm listening and learning and then testing. Meagan, thank you so much for being so generous with your time. I really really appreciate it. Right before we leave, I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. And why those three specific words. Yeah. I mean, one executive mom. So, I'm working, but I have three children which I already talked about. So, I think that's pretty obvious. I love being in tech and I love actually working. And the third word would be hardworking. I've always got something going on. I like to be out there doing stuff and learning and busy. I think that advising 25 companies and doing all the things that you've done along your career, I think it shows. Meagan, thank you very very much. Thank you for all the incredible work you're doing and for the inspiration And best of luck. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Take care. Wonderful.
