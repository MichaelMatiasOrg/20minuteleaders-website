1
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,520
Jill Wesley, thank you so much

2
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,960
for joining my show, 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,720
How are you?

4
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,520
I'm doing great.

5
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,120
Thanks for having me.

6
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,320
How have you helped 80,000 people

7
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,280
become better speakers

8
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,160
and convey their messages?

9
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,480
How is that humanly possible?

10
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,720
How is it humanly possible?

11
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,880
Well, I've done it for almost 30 years

12
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,200
and the number actually

13
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,800
is higher than 85,000.

14
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,200
It's because I was a road warrior

15
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,800
for a really long time.

16
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,640
And I did management leadership training,

17
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,480
I did coaching and personal development

18
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,080
and professional development programs

19
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,680
for leaders and employees.

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,840
So, we did communication,

21
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,440
intercultural communication

22
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,600
and speaker coaching.

23
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,720
So, I was on the road for a long time

24
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
working with thousands

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,480
and thousands of people.

26
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,120
What does that mean, working on the road?

27
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,880
It means, literally, being on the road

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,040
moving between company and company

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,800
and working physically with them?

30
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,800
I was, I used to be one of those.

31
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,920
My 20s were spent

32
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,120
traveling around the world

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,640
doing it a part time backpacker.

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,280
And then I would land in a country

35
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,480
make something work, save money,

36
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,680
and then go spend it

37
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,160
and travel some more.

38
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,200
But then in my 30s,

39
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,840
I did corporate training and coaching,

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,480
So, I worked as a consultant.

41
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,120
So, a number of years I was on the road

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,920
maybe a hundred days a year.

43
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,080
Hundreds days a year?

44
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,720
[--] all over the world.

45
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,040
Yeah, it was a lot.

46
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,920
Give me a little bit of taste.

47
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,960
What were some of the craziest places

48
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,360
that this work took you

49
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,160
or craziest experiences?

50
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,200
Crazy experience?

51
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,320
Well, all the experiences were later

52
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,320
you learn with time.

53
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,280
Time and distance equals humor.

54
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,040
So, a lot of the crazy

55
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,240
really difficult things that went on,

56
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,840
later became the best stories.

57
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,040
I always tell my clients that

58
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,560
when they're putting

59
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,360
their keynotes together.

60
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,580
But there were times where

61
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,320
I showed up to do a speaking gig

62
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,920
and there was no room for us

63
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,320
or I had a fistfight one time

64
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,120
in a session.

65
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,440
But in terms of location,

66
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,680
Just casually putting them in there

67
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,920
and continuing, I love it.

68
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,280
I said that too casually.

69
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,480
But when it's human behavior

70
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,800
and you get a group of people together,

71
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
it's a human lab and anything's possible.

72
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
I didn't start the fight.

73
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,480
But I'm just saying,

74
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,120
like anything can happen.

75
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,520
But in terms of actual locations,

76
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,000
I've just been really honored

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,680
to work all over Asia and Europe

78
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,000
and then a few three months in Australia,

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,360
working at 23, I got to work at

80
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,520
eight major universities in Australia.

81
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,960
I didn't work that hard,

82
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,880
it was fun and distracting and sunny.

83
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,920
Unbelievable. Okay.

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,800
So, I had the privilege of giving

85
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,480
a TEDx talk in Palo Alto

86
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,960
about, I guess, it was five years ago.

87
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,040
It was hard.

88
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,680
It was a process.

89
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,280
It was really really difficult.

90
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,200
Not just getting up on stage,

91
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,000
which is frightening for any person

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,200
no matter how much you're building,

93
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
you'll be scared.

94
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,120
But the whole process is very difficult.

95
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,200
Why is giving keynotes

96
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
or presentations so hard?

97
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,320
Well, it's hard for a number of reasons.

98
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,640
If it's a business presentation,

99
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,600
the average person

100
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,080
can be challenged with it

101
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,640
because there's a lot riding on it.

102
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,760
It's the reputation at work,

103
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,840
it's moving a process forward at work,

104
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,200
it's getting your ideas heard,

105
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,840
or helping people make big decisions.

106
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,480
So, a lot of people know

107
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,720
that there is a lot at stake

108
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,680
and they feel nervous.

109
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,240
If someone's doing a keynote,

110
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,880
it's usually the combination

111
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,440
of their work experience

112
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,200
plus a bit of their thought leadership

113
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,960
or personal brand.

114
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,280
My day to day is spent with senior leaders

115
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,360
who have a track record of success.

116
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,160
So, by the time they're on stage

117
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,440
and we are working together

118
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,560
at major events, part of it is,

119
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,280
oh my gosh, I've been so good

120
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,680
as a presenter at work all these years.

121
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,080
Now, I don't want to mess it up

122
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,080
when I know millions of people are good.

123
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,000
So, what I always remind people is,

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,880
it's a process.

125
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,000
There's no finish line.

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,280
Everybody is going to hit a wall

127
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,040
and feel nervous.

128
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,840
I joke, it is my clients

129
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,560
usually at one point are thinking like,

130
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,160
"How do I get out of doing this talk?"

131
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,840
"What if I just tell them I'm sick?"

132
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,680
"What if I go

133
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,080
in the witness protection program?"

134
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,880
All these fantasies

135
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,120
of not having to do it.

136
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,920
But my job as a coach is

137
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,800
to just let them know

138
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,120
that's a normal process,

139
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,440
it's the messy middle.

140
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,760
And I actually have a process

141
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,520
to get them from start to finish.

142
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,800
I like that, the messy middle.

143
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,600
That this idea that at some point

144
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,400
throughout the process

145
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,480
you're going to reach this block

146
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,200
where you say, okay, I'm not prepared yet,

147
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
it's not ready yet.

148
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,320
And you forget that

149
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,240
there are a few days left

150
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,040
or a few weeks left

151
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,520
and you're, I guess, imagining yourself,

152
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,000
giving the talk as it is now,

153
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,160
even though that's not the reality.

154
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,240
You still have time, right?

155
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,400
You still have time.

156
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,680
But tell me about this process

157
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,360
that you work

158
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,720
because it's so fascinating to me.

159
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,120
Because obviously it is.

160
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,600
I believe that

161
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,240
the fear of public speaking,

162
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,080
if I'm not mistaken,

163
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,720
is more common than fear of death.

164
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,040
I think it's the [--].

165
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,080
We haven't sourced that research.

166
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,960
So, it's often quoted.

167
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,200
It is a common fear, I'll put it that way.

168
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,840
To this day, I'm not sure

169
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,520
if I've heard anybody actually

170
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,480
dying from public speaking.

171
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,240
So, most people,

172
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,720
But it's death itself is very existential.

173
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,120
But the fear that we experience

174
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,880
and the nerves giving a talk is real

175
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,080
and it's likely and it happens

176
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,280
over and over again.

177
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,920
So for most people, it's a concern

178
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,360
that on a cellular level for people,

179
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,320
there's a concern that

180
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,200
they're going to be judged,

181
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,240
that they're going to fail.

182
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,720
Yes.

183
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,800
And your body is registering

184
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,160
an actual threat

185
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,920
and it's trying to protect you.

186
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,400
So, what a lot of people

187
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,080
don't realize is

188
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,560
when they're feeling nervous,

189
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,480
they will then criticize themselves

190
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,760
for feeling nervous:

191
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,500
I can't believe it,

192
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,400
I told myself

193
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,480
I wouldn't feel this way;

194
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
or I've been doing this

195
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,200
for five years, why.

196
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,040
And that self-criticism

197
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,600
never makes the nerves go away

198
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,320
that's number one.

199
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,080
Number two, reframing it from:

200
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,600
I'm feeling like I'm going to die

201
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,120
and my body's betraying me.

202
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,480
If you understand that your body

203
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,400
is actually having a response

204
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,960
and it's doing what it thinks

205
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,320
it needs to do to help you

206
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,880
and then reframing it

207
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,520
from nervous to excitement.

208
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,680
Most of my clients, I will say,

209
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
the keynote clients that I work with

210
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,360
are not terribly nervous.

211
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,280
They're excited.

212
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,160
They've been speaking for years,

213
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,840
and in business or science

214
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,880
for a number of years.

215
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,200
So, they're hungry and they're excited.

216
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,280
And my job is to pull them out

217
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,320
to get more of them into their talk.

218
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,960
So, it's not just their data,

219
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,240
not just their work.

220
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,520
So, what makes a successful keynote?

221
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,840
Whether it's a business keynote

222
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,600
that's full of data and statistics,

223
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,040
or if it's more of a personal keynote

224
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,800
about your personal journey

225
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,360
or about how others can get inspiration

226
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:20,960
from your journey.

227
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,480
So, give me some ideas of what makes

228
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,720
a successful keynote.

229
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,200
Yeah, I put it, I call them the three R's.

230
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,440
So, the measure of a really

231
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,040
successful presentation or talk

232
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,760
isn't did everybody jump up

233
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
and do a standing ovation,

234
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,120
because that's an experience

235
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,800
in the moment.

236
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,640
But I really care about what happens

237
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,880
when people leave.

238
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,560
So, the three things are the three R's:

239
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,320
Is your content relatable.

240
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,600
So, for far too long,

241
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,640
people have gotten up on stage

242
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,040
and spoken from a place

243
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,960
or a perspective

244
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,160
that was not taking into account

245
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,520
the different lived experiences

246
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,120
of people of color like me

247
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,640
or women's experiences in work and life.

248
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,920
So, is the content relatable,

249
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,760
And do you truly understand

250
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,960
and respect your audience,

251
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,520
were you putting content together

252
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,000
that relates to them.

253
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,160
Number two, is your content

254
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,920
something that people can remember.

255
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,360
So, you have to relate.

256
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,720
Can people remember it,

257
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,560
meaning it's structured effectively

258
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,480
that you're not doing a total data dump

259
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,720
or you're telling a personal story

260
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,160
that takes 17 minutes

261
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,840
that isn't relevant to the audience.

262
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,360
And then the third piece is,

263
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,880
can people repeat it.

264
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,760
Because a lot of my clients

265
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,200
actually create movements.

266
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,120
They're working at really high levels.

267
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,320
If we're going to create systemic change

268
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,400
or cultural change movement type work,

269
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,160
people have to be able to repeat

270
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,520
what they heard to serve others.

271
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,880
So, those are the three things

272
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,960
I talk about.

273
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,320
And how do you measure that?

274
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,160
So, I gave a talk and I went off of stage,

275
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,360
and yeah, it's on YouTube

276
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,400
and we have the views.

277
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,080
How do I actually measure

278
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,360
whether my talk was successful

279
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,600
and according to these three R's?

280
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,680
Yeah. It depends on the industry

281
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,280
and the type of speaker I'm working with.

282
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,400
So, yes, of course,

283
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,560
it's great to have those metrics

284
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,280
and see that one of my clients talks,

285
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,240
is it three million, that's fabulous.

286
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,520
However, the folks that I'm working with

287
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,320
are already head down doing the deep work

288
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,440
and they happen to be

289
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,160
on stage talking about it.

290
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,360
So, the metrics that

291
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,480
we're actually looking at

292
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,840
is did they get funding,

293
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,520
was there an increase in funding.

294
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,880
It's a business development tool

295
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,880
where they able to get

296
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,120
some key relationships

297
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,760
that help them with their research

298
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,600
where they able to align

299
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,360
and get connections with policymakers.

300
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,160
So, it's much more tangible

301
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,960
beyond the applause

302
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,680
or the [--].

303
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,720
I think it's incredible.

304
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,520
I'm coming from the software world.

305
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,360
And in the software world

306
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,080
when we launch, for example, our product

307
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,800
there's a couple of ways of looking at it.

308
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,120
One is you put up the website

309
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,840
and you want to measure

310
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,160
how many good impressions have you had,

311
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,440
how many people have gone and seen

312
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,080
your beautifully designed logo

313
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,160
and you're beautiful website.

314
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,080
And then the question is,

315
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,760
how many people actually

316
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,960
put their credit card and paid.

317
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,560
How many people actually converted

318
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,520
to paying customers, which is obviously,

319
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,480
what you're optimizing for.

320
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
You're not optimizing

321
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,520
for how many people have seen it.

322
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,720
You're optimizing for how many people

323
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,880
have bought into your messaging.

324
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,960
And that brings me on

325
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,480
to a set of questions that I have.

326
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,400
Because going through this experience,

327
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,520
you watch all these incredible talk

328
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,680
whether it's on TED

329
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,320
or all these different platforms.

330
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,280
And a lot of people are wondering as well,

331
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,640
myself included,

332
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,920
how much are they improvised

333
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,600
in the moment,

334
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,120
authentic versus very rehearsed?

335
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,800
Because a lot of them

336
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,120
feel extremely improvised,

337
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,160
very lively in the moment,

338
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,520
but there is a lot of preparation

339
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,320
that goes in there.

340
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,640
So, how do you balance between the two?

341
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,360
Yeah. So, that's good

342
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,880
that a lot of them feel improvised to you.

343
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,360
Because the bigger events,

344
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,800
so I'm head of speaker coaching

345
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,920
for TEDx San Francisco,

346
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,600
so we have a premier event, global event,

347
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,800
and our speaker, there's no way

348
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,520
we're going to let people

349
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,680
just go up there and wing it.

350
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,440
It's just not in the process.

351
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
They won't present

352
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,880
their best content that way

353
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,960
and the audience

354
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,440
won't have the best experience.

355
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,760
We can't just take that risk.

356
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,040
And TED itself,

357
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,040
because I've coached speakers

358
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,640
that have spoken on TED stages,

359
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,120
they worked together with coaches

360
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,920
for months and months.

361
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,560
So, the goal is when people get

362
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,880
where they get stuck is

363
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,440
I don't want to sound canned,

364
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,000
I don't want to sound rehearsed

365
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,020
and like I'm a robot,

366
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,880
I don't want that either.

367
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,440
But there's a difference between

368
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,680
memorizing a talk and then actually,

369
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,360
integrating that talk into who you are.

370
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,400
And that's the difference

371
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,120
if you're thinking about

372
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,560
someone who's an actor.

373
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,240
An actor will know their lines.

374
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,160
But a really good actor

375
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,240
disappears into the character

376
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,280
and they're having that experience

377
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,120
with the audience.

378
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,320
So, I'm different from some other coaches

379
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,120
because my job is to meet my clients

380
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,320
where they are.

381
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,880
I have a ton of strategy in my pocket.

382
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,000
So, if I'm working with someone

383
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,880
who I know is the type that

384
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,560
really needs to write their speech out

385
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,760
word for word,

386
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,280
and they're really attached to that,

387
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,200
I'll let them do that initially

388
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,600
but I'm always going to get them

389
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,120
from it's not memorizing word for word,

390
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,120
it's just knowing the flow.

391
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,000
And if it's someone

392
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,800
who likes to be loose

393
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,560
and be improvisational,

394
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,040
I still get them to know the flow.

395
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,880
So then, they're going to practice.

396
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,280
They've practiced at multiple times

397
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,320
with their space

398
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,520
in the event that the audience will laugh.

399
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,680
I mean, I put a lot of help my clients

400
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,160
put humor in their talks

401
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,960
and you will get a response

402
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,640
from the audience

403
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,240
or you'll get spontaneous applause.

404
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,400
So, you have to be present

405
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,200
to actually engage with people

406
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,000
in that moment.

407
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,520
It's hilarious to bring this up.

408
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,800
So, I gave a talk back when I was 14,

409
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,440
it was my second time on stage.

410
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,920
It was about to start up in real time.

411
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,240
I had nothing interesting to say

412
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,000
except for how a 14 year old uses Skype

413
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,920
to do a video call with their math class

414
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,560
from 15,000 miles away.

415
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,400
Back then, it was 10 years ago,

416
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,800
it wasn't very common.

417
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,760
So, it was interesting to the people

418
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,520
in the audience.

419
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,560
But what the funny thing was that

420
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,160
I prepared so much for this talk.

421
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,560
I am releasing a book soon

422
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,200
where I talk about

423
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,360
some childhood experiences

424
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,480
and one of the experiences

425
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,840
was walking around Central Park

426
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,600
with my brother.

427
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,120
And he is rehearsing with me

428
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,560
word for word my speech,

429
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,000
my talk for weeks.

430
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,080
And leading up to the talk,

431
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,320
I knew it so well

432
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,320
I could say it in the middle of my sleep.

433
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,240
I get to the stage

434
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,320
and my first question is,

435
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,800
"Hey, how's everybody doing?"

436
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,520
Now, when I rehearsed this talk,

437
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,840
I never actually gave pause

438
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,360
because there was nobody to answer.

439
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,600
So, when I got on stage, I said,

440
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,640
"Hey, how everybody is doing?"

441
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,080
"Great, let's get started."

442
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,040
And I never gave them a way to answer

443
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,560
which was it's hilarious.

444
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,000
That's what happens. It is.

445
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,320
I see a keynote in particular

446
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,760
as a living thing.

447
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,120
So, very similar to you in product,

448
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,280
I think of a keynote, for my clients,

449
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,960
it's a product launch.

450
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,800
So, it's an iterative process.

451
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,000
We use universal design theory.

452
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,160
We have to test.

453
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,040
You have to do all of those steps

454
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,640
that you would do with product

455
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,560
to make sure that

456
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,560
whatever you create and deliver

457
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,680
is truly something to your best,

458
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,600
the best of your ability

459
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,760
is something that the audience

460
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,000
is going to relate to and respond.

461
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,720
But you have to take notes

462
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,000
once you've done your keynote

463
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,040
or you have to watch the film afterwards

464
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,800
to see what really landed

465
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,760
and pay attention

466
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,960
to the questions you get at

467
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,240
in the comments afterwards

468
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,840
because it will inform this keynote.

469
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,640
Because I help people deliver

470
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,600
and excuse me, design an asset

471
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,320
that they're going to keep using.

472
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,120
So, nobody is going to be giving

473
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,360
the same exact keynote over and over

474
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,920
to audience after audience

475
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,120
because you're in a different city.

476
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,920
You're talking to people

477
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,880
in different roles, different levels

478
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,160
within an organization.

479
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,040
You'd have to make it tie in

480
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,240
to what their lived experiences.

481
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,200
100%.

482
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,560
So, in the few minutes we have left,

483
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,560
I'd love some pointers

484
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,240
on things that I could take with me

485
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,880
to whatever future presentations I make,

486
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,040
or at least the process of working

487
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,920
on those presentations.

488
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,920
Because obviously,

489
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,000
not everybody is so lucky

490
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,640
to have you as a coach

491
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,000
in preparing for their keynote.

492
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,880
And I'd love to get some pointers

493
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,800
into what can I do the next time I go

494
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,680
to present something to my boss

495
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,720
in the startup that I work for,

496
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,960
what can my friends do

497
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,360
when they're about to go in class

498
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,120
and present something

499
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,000
in front of 500 people on their research?

500
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,800
Sure.

501
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
I have a five step process I use

502
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,240
called, dig deeper.

503
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,960
Because you can come in 10 minutes,

504
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,240
10 seconds, you can find the steps

505
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
to give a general presentation.

506
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,560
You analyze your audience,

507
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,640
you get your big message together

508
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,800
and support it with

509
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,560
and then put in action step.

510
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
But something deeper

511
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,960
that I use as a checklist

512
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,440
with senior leaders is five steps.

513
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,520
So first, you have to speak the truth.

514
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,120
So, it's really figuring out

515
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,320
what is my truth,

516
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,680
my understanding of the truth,

517
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,560
and do I have an accurate sense

518
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,320
of what's actually going on.

519
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,560
Because if you're presenting,

520
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,320
let's say it's someone whose entry level

521
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,120
or middle management

522
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,560
and they're presenting to their boss

523
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,840
and they're not accurate,

524
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,040
it's a credibility hit right there.

525
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,160
So, make sure that

526
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,680
you really have the truth

527
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,960
and you are acknowledging

528
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,840
your blind spots and biases.

529
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,120
Second, it's empathy.

530
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,400
And it's not just empathy

531
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,720
for what other people are feeling,

532
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,440
but having a sense of cognitive empathy.

533
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,720
So, it's what are other people

534
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,920
thinking about.

535
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,520
And a bit of what's called

536
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,760
rational compassion,

537
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,920
because there are limits to empathy.

538
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,520
We tend to empathize the most

539
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,200
with people who are similar to us.

540
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,920
Yeah.

541
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,480
Or if we've had a similar experience

542
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,520
where we say,

543
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,240
"Well, I did it,

544
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,200
it shouldn't be that hard."

545
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,000
"Just work hard, you can do it yourself."

546
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,800
And it's like, listen,

547
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,880
someone's having a different life journey

548
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,720
than you are.

549
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,800
So, it's truth.

550
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,040
It's empathy.

551
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,120
And then, really thinking about,

552
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,800
do you have an element of hope

553
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,080
when you're talking,

554
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,320
are you speaking in a way

555
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,800
where people feel like they can do this,

556
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,600
that it's not beyond everybody's ability.

557
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,000
The fourth step is your vision.

558
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,400
So, what do you see as possible

559
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,760
and can you communicate it in a way

560
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,160
that other people can actually

561
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,560
be there right with you.

562
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,560
And then the last step,

563
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,360
which is huge, is accountability.

564
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,640
Accountability is missing from most talks.

565
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,840
They are real general things

566
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,120
at the end of a presentation or a talk.

567
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,480
And people just be really general like,

568
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,280
"You can do it, come on."

569
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,400
And if people can't get a clear grasp

570
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,160
of what needs to be done,

571
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,000
those initial steps,

572
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,880
they're less likely to do anything.

573
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,000
And that's why people go

574
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,800
from event to event to event

575
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,200
to get pumped up

576
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,320
and that they don't know

577
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,560
how to actually do it.

578
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,960
So, they're chasing the high

579
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,040
of being in the room versus, oh, wait,

580
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,600
I want to make some behavioral change.

581
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,440
It actually takes strategy and have it.

582
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,240
I like the accountability.

583
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,720
Jill, why spend so much time on this?

584
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,920
Why work with so many speakers?

585
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,640
Why go through all of this?

586
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,080
What gets you excited

587
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,680
about science and soul of speaking?

588
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,240
Oh, my gosh.

589
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,240
I have the best job in the world.

590
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,160
Like, I'm truly doing

591
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,440
the thing I love to do most.

592
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,800
My work doesn't feel like work at all.

593
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,400
At all.

594
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,760
And I stand on the shoulders of people

595
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,840
who came before me.

596
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,880
I'm African-American.

597
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,960
I come from generations of people

598
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,480
who weren't able to use their voice.

599
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,640
And I'm fortunate to have that luck.

600
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,920
Yeah, I've worked hard,

601
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,320
but it's luck and timing.

602
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,400
I was born when I was born

603
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,920
and I feel that everyone deserves

604
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,240
the ability to speak their truth

605
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,840
and know what matters.

606
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,320
And that's why I do this work.

607
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,160
I love it.

608
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,800
Before we leave,

609
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,480
I want to thank you again

610
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,840
for being so generous of your time.

611
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,440
This was just wonderful,

612
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,000
insightful, inspiring.

613
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,920
I just loved it.

614
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,400
And I'll definitely look forward

615
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
to reflecting on this talk

616
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,720
as I continue on in my journey

617
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,360
and hopefully collaborate together one day

618
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,920
if I'm ever fortunate enough

619
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,480
to make it to those big stages

620
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,600
that you help people on.

621
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,440
Before we leave, Jill,

622
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,880
I need three words that you would use

623
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,680
to describe yourself

624
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,560
and why those three specific words.

625
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,920
Okay. Well,

626
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,160
I've been inside the house for months, so,

627
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,920
I mean, my initial three words are like

628
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,640
yoga pants, potato chips, and TV.

629
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,880
But if we go a little bit deeper,

630
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,720
the first one is commitment.

631
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,600
I'm really committed

632
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,840
to doing the work I do

633
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,120
and helping people.

634
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,480
It's curiosity.

635
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,680
I've always been curious

636
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,520
and willing to challenge myself

637
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,840
to keep my mind open.

638
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,960
And then collaborative.

639
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,760
Because nobody gets ahead on their own.

640
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,400
And it's really about working together.

641
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,560
And if you get into a big room

642
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,800
and you get through that door,

643
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,280
it's keeping that door open

644
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,840
and waving other people into.

645
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,400
I love it.

646
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,040
Jill, thank you very very much.

647
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,280
This is just wonderful.

648
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,920
And stay safe and stay healthy.

649
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,600
Thank you.

650
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,640
My pleasure. Thanks.
