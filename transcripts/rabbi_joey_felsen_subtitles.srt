1
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,120
Rabbi Joey, thank you for being on my show

2
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,960
20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,080
It's very gracious of you

4
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,880
to give me your time.

5
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,520
Thank you for inviting me.

6
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,280
Of course, of course,

7
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,040
So, we know each other from J- Ventures,

8
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,360
where you're also an LP.

9
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,280
And while J-Ventures has this

10
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,720
incredible mission of both investing.

11
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,680
Investing is part

12
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,040
of a capitalistic Kibbutz.

13
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,280
While bringing together

14
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,880
Jewish-Americans and Israelis,

15
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,280
you're approaching this issue of the

16
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,280
difference between the two communities,

17
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,080
not necessarily from a financial

18
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,720
and an investment route,

19
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,760
but more from a more cultural

20
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,000
and community aspect, right?

21
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,360
Right. In other words, I think that

22
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,560
the Jewish community has a lot to offer

23
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,160
the Israeli community and vice versa.

24
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,400
And I think the commonality

25
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,720
between both are Judaism.

26
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,480
Okay. So, right before we get into that,

27
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,520
I'd love you to give me a little bit

28
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,000
of background about yourself.

29
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,040
Where are you from and how did

30
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,080
you even get to Silicon Valley?

31
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,360
And to ask yourself the question,

32
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,680
how do I work with these two

33
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,880
communities within the Bay Area?

34
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay. So, I'm originally

35
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,760
from Toronto, Canada.

36
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,520
Toronto is a very very strong

37
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,960
Jewish community.

38
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,640
Also with a very large Israeli population.

39
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,480
And I grew up there in day schools.

40
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,640
I had a very strong Jewish education.

41
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,120
I ended up getting a degree there

42
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,680
in university in political science.

43
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,080
And I went afterwards to go and study

44
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,360
to become a rabbi in Israel.

45
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,400
I am teached in both.

46
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,040
And I got my ordination

47
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,240
while I was in Jerusalem.

48
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,160
And when I was a student on campus,

49
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,240
I was very active

50
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,640
in a lot of Jewish activism.

51
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,680
Both on behalf of Israel

52
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,680
but also all sorts of other juries.

53
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,240
It was before the Iron Curtain fell.

54
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,440
I'm quite old.

55
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,320
And so, I was busy fighting to get

56
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,920
the Jews out of the Soviet Union

57
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,280
and Ethiopia and Syria.

58
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
And that was sort of my career

59
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,880
when I was in college.

60
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,640
I eventually became the vice president

61
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,360
of something called

62
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,880
the World Union of Jewish Students.

63
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,320
And from there, I decided that if I wanted

64
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,080
to make a real impact on the Jewish world,

65
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,440
the best idea would be to get

66
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,280
a very strong Jewish education

67
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,160
and be able to connect people

68
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,080
to their heritage.

69
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,000
So, I left Canada.

70
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,800
I went to Israel.

71
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,240
I was there for eight and a half years.

72
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,880
Wow. Studied for eight and a half years.

73
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,440
I did.

74
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,040
Wow.

75
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,640
And I ended up getting married

76
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,080
after the first six and a half.

77
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,440
And my wife and I,

78
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,800
Sorry. After the first two years,

79
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,400
I was there married six and a half years.

80
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,720
And while I was in Israel,

81
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,440
I was trying to figure out

82
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,600
what my next step would be.

83
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,920
And people always spoke about

84
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,680
the Bay Area as this anomaly.

85
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,240
That there is a black hole

86
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,040
on the Jewish map

87
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,880
because it was under-serviced

88
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,080
with respect to Jewish education.

89
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,720
There were very few day schools.

90
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,800
There were very few kids

91
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,560
going to day schools.

92
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,040
There was not much around.

93
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,600
And especially, within the more

94
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,640
traditional community,

95
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,480
there was very, very little.

96
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,320
There were a few synagogues

97
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,920
that were here that were tiny.

98
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,640
There were a couple Chabad

99
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,680
[--] that were here.

100
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,440
And so, when we looked around,

101
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,320
it looked like an amazing opportunity

102
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,400
to try to do something

103
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,520
in the field of Jewish education.

104
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,280
I ended up putting

105
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,640
a team together in Israel

106
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
and we all came as six families.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,760
We moved here in 2001.

108
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,840
And we started it was called,

109
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,760
the Jewish Study Network.

110
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,220
And the tagline is:

111
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,240
To raise the level of Jewish literacy

112
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,520
in the Bay Area.

113
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,320
Now, is this for both Israelis

114
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,560
and American-Jewish people?

115
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,520
Or is this just for American Jews?

116
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,720
What sort of the target audience for this?

117
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,560
It's for both.

118
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,600
It's for everybody.

119
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,280
Okay. Wonderful.

120
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,880
That alludes to an interesting point,

121
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,200
because I think this is

122
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,680
a very interesting conversation.

123
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,080
Especially because, I'm here

124
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,640
living in Palo Alto.

125
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,560
Basically across the street

126
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,580
I'm a secular Jew.

127
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,680
Very Israeli coming in.

128
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,640
My main affiliation with the JCC.

129
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,800
I just had a great conversation

130
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,400
with Zack Bodner.

131
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,520
And I told him that I love the JCC

132
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,680
because I get to go and listen

133
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,880
to Israeli artists who come here.

134
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,560
But I don't really go to synagogue

135
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,360
and I see Judaism more

136
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,560
in the traditional aspect of it.

137
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,000
And I feel that that's a part of

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,320
the disparity between

139
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,720
American-Jews and Israelis.

140
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,560
Do you feel that same way?

141
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,680
Or do you see it differently?

142
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,920
Well, so there is a disparity like that.

143
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,400
One thing that I find, though,

144
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,720
is that for a lot of Israelis

145
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,120
that come here and decide to try

146
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,360
to at least investigate Judaism,

147
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,800
it's their first foray into something

148
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,720
that's very very rich.

149
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,160
And people get very excited.

150
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,400
So, there were a lot of Israelis

151
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,960
that actually have started

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,360
trying to study Talmud

153
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,640
and trying to study the Torah.

154
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,160
And really figure out what is it

155
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,560
that defines Judaism

156
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,200
beyond the nationalism.

157
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,720
That they're definitely familiar with.

158
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,040
And which is ironic because

159
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,120
they're coming from Israel

160
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,400
and now they're coming to the Gola

161
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,480
and all of a sudden

162
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,560
they're becoming more Jewish.

163
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,000
That's right. That's right.

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,800
And they're definitely becoming

165
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,160
more knowledgeable about being Jew.

166
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,920
Right.

167
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,360
That, for sure is happening here.

168
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,040
And in a place like Silicon Valley,

169
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,320
people are highly intellectual,

170
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,920
highly curious and very motivated.

171
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,600
So, if they spend even just a little bit

172
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,400
of their energy in trying to explore

173
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,320
something Jewish, it ends up being

174
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,080
a very productive experience for them.

175
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,760
Okay. Joey, what is Jewish studies?

176
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,680
I've never went to a Jewish day school.

177
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,400
I've never studied the Talmud.

178
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,600
So, give me a very brief,

179
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,600
what is Jewish studies overall?

180
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,160
Okay. Jewish Studies is a study for us

181
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,320
at the Jewish Study Network.

182
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,840
It's primarily a look

183
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,000
at the classic texts.

184
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,040
It sort of defined the Jewish people.

185
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,400
So, the Torah is the first

186
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,000
and it's the most obvious.

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,920
But if you go beyond the Torah

188
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,520
and the rest of Tanakh,

189
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,520
there is a whole wealth of literature

190
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,080
that we have managed to produce

191
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,880
over the past couple of millennia,

192
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,600
dealing with all sorts of things.

193
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,360
So, the Talmud, the Babylonian Tom,

194
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,320
what I would say is first and foremost,

195
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,520
it's almost like a time capsule

196
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,480
in which all of Judaism has been preserved

197
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,280
by the sages a couple thousand years ago.

198
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,400
And it deals with everything from law.

199
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,160
Law is certainly a big part of it.

200
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,000
Jewish law in particular.

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,400
But there's also a perspective on things

202
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,160
that people would find cultural.

203
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,280
There are recipes.

204
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,400
There are language conversations.

205
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,080
There is this really the experience

206
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,940
of what it means to be

207
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,840
part of this people.

208
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,560
The Jewish people are particularly

209
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,520
difficult to define.

210
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,960
Because it's hard to define them

211
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,760
as a nation because they live

212
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,480
for thousands of years without a state.

213
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,720
It's also hard to define them

214
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,320
as a religion.

215
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,680
Because people who are not religious

216
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,360
are still considered to be completely part

217
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,280
of the Jewish people, right?

218
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,480
There are people who don't believe in God,

219
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,040
and yet they're as Jewish as somebody

220
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,920
who does believe in God

221
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,440
as long as they follow other criteria.

222
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,840
So, it's almost like this anomaly

223
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,160
of a people that exists on the planet

224
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,840
that has been through

225
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,920
an incredible incredible history

226
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,840
and that has contributed to the world

227
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,440
in so many different ways.

228
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,200
in terms of a sense of

229
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,320
not just the morality and the ethics

230
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,000
that we say come from the Torah.

231
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,040
But even contributing in terms of science

232
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,800
and the understanding

233
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,920
of the way the world operates.

234
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,560
For me, it's not an accident

235
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,320
that there are so many Nobel Prize winners

236
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,240
that happen to come from

237
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:40,960
the Jewish people.

238
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,720
They're driven.

239
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,200
They're motivated.

240
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,920
And I think that there's just,

241
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,480
when it comes to something Judaism,

242
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:49,600
there is so much there.

243
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,920
When people come to me and they say

244
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,960
that they want us to try to understand.

245
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,200
So, I usually direct them towards a class

246
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,240
in the Torah portion.

247
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,080
Let them at least see

248
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,600
what it what it's like beyond

249
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,840
the Bible stories that they learned

250
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,560
when they were very little.

251
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,360
Or I'll send them to something like

252
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,240
Ethics of the Fathers

253
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,640
Pirkei Avot,

254
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,840
where they get to understand

255
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,800
the moral underpinnings of what it means

256
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,640
to be a society based around morality.

257
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,920
And I think that all of the things

258
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,560
that people study,

259
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,680
they usually walk away saying

260
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,920
that this informs their current life

261
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,080
Because one thing

262
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,280
that we believe very strongly is,

263
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,320
a human nature hasn't changed

264
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,960
over thousands of years.

265
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,880
We might have new technology

266
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,760
and we might look a little bit different

267
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,520
in terms of the way that we dress.

268
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,440
But the way that we are intrinsically

269
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,880
is still the same.

270
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,600
And so, the sages in their wisdom

271
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,120
managed to articulate values

272
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,760
and principles that are as relevant today

273
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,880
as they were thousands of years ago.

274
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,840
Right. I mean, one of the things

275
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,560
that I discovered here,

276
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,800
especially at Stanford is that

277
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,880
it's not only Jews that do Jewish studies.

278
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,920
But a lot of these things

279
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,680
are relevant also

280
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,080
for the average global citizen.

281
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
That the lessons learned about

282
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,800
the community and culture and respect,

283
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,320
they are cross-religion

284
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,640
and they're cross-borders.

285
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,960
Is that something that you also find?

286
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,960
Or do you think, contrary to that,

287
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,680
it is mainly for Jewish people?

288
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,000
No, I would say like this.

289
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,560
I think that there is so much

290
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,960
of it that should be universal.

291
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,920
And the way that we approach

292
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,480
it is universal. Right?

293
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,560
We believe that there's a plan

294
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,280
for the whole world.

295
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,080
It's not just a plan

296
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,640
for the Jewish people.

297
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,520
We just believe that

298
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,160
when it comes to certain laws

299
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,480
that we as the Jewish people,

300
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,280
have a higher level of responsibility

301
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,960
to follow particular laws.

302
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,520
In other words,

303
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,040
we're supposed to be a little bit distinct

304
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,280
and the expression: light into the nations.

305
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,560
We're supposed to be an example

306
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,680
of what it means to live

307
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,600
in a moral and ethical life.

308
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,880
In all of our classes,

309
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,600
I think there are people

310
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,360
that are not Jewish that come

311
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,120
to experience and to learn and to gain.

312
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,160
And I think that when it comes

313
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,200
to a sense of ethics and morality,

314
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,280
yeah, Judaism is the form the law

315
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,280
of the conversations that take place

316
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,400
both in medicine and in law

317
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,680
and all sorts of other arenas.

318
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,440
In fact, organizations like

319
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,360
the Jewish Study Network

320
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,600
are asked to give continuing

321
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,320
education credits in the field of ethics

322
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,080
for all sorts of professional fields

323
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,760
because there is value that's universal.

324
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,160
Wow. So, where are we headed now?

325
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,280
So, I mean, one of the key things

326
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,200
that I've observed in Israel is definitely

327
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,760
a very clear separation

328
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,320
and a growing separation, unfortunately,

329
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,840
between secular Jews and religious Jews.

330
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,480
I haven't yet experienced this here.

331
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,600
But, coming in from your perspective

332
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,440
of Jewish studies and trying to bring

333
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,160
together these two tribes

334
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,060
here in Silicon Valley

335
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,560
and looking more globally the world,

336
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,120
where are the Jewish people headed?

337
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,160
And what is our role in helping

338
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,480
make sure that it's headed the right way?

339
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,960
That's a very good question.

340
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,240
I think that it's true that the media

341
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,720
likes to report on the flashpoints

342
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,560
of conflict between

343
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,560
the religious community

344
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,960
and secular community.

345
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,080
I think in reality, that the communities

346
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,040
are starting to understand each other

347
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,440
a little differently.

348
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,240
So, for example,

349
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,600
within the ultra religious in Israel,

350
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,000
there is a big shift in which people

351
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,800
are deciding to embrace secular education

352
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,080
in a way that they haven't before.

353
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,120
I'm sure you're familiar with Kama-Tech.

354
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,800
I was just about to talk about

355
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,920
Moshe Friedman because I love him to bits

356
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
and he's incredible. Yeah.

357
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,320
Yeah, he is incredible.

358
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,240
And what he's doing is amazing.

359
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,760
And it's just a tip of the iceberg.

360
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,280
There are many people that are starting

361
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,120
to realize that that community

362
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,680
can't continue to exist

363
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,120
at the levels of poverty

364
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
that they've been living at.

365
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,120
And that they have to embrace

366
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,840
some sense of modernity when it comes

367
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,200
to providing for themselves.

368
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,680
And they're doing so.

369
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,040
And the media doesn't like

370
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,240
to talk about it as much.

371
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,920
It's not as exciting as the war

372
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,640
as they go on between the communities.

373
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,480
They do believe that

374
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,600
there's a very big shift.

375
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,120
I think that I am a little concerned

376
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,480
with the relationship between

377
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
Israel and the diaspora.

378
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,040
I think that the Jewish community

379
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,960
in the diaspora

380
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,120
is not as in touch with the centrality

381
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,440
that Israel should play within Judaism.

382
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,600
Right.

383
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,840
So, they see it as something

384
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,960
other than themselves.

385
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,280
It's the Jewish homeland.

386
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,760
But they don't necessarily feel

387
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,440
as connected to it as they should.

388
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,240
And I think that it's the responsibility

389
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,360
of the community here

390
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,200
to take a look at the way that

391
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,520
we're educating our young people, right?

392
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
The ones that do get a Jewish education,

393
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,800
why are they not walking away

394
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,920
with a passion for Israel?

395
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,600
I think that that is a failing

396
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,960
that has to be addressed.

397
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,640
Definitely. I'm very involved

398
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,360
with the Birthright program.

399
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,760
And I also have Gidi Mark,

400
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,680
the CEO of Birthright on this show,

401
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,520
and I did a few of those trips, myself.

402
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,680
And what I find is that,

403
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,600
the minute you have somebody

404
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,720
walk into Israel and see the miracle

405
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,600
of the Holy Land and the startup nation

406
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,200
part of it as well.

407
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,880
I think that one of the most important

408
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,640
things that we can do for Israel is,

409
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,040
put aside some of the conflicts

410
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,480
and the politics and the religion.

411
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,600
Just talk about the miracle

412
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,920
of the startup nation

413
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,920
and what incredible things

414
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,840
that it has done.

415
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,200
And I see how eye opening it is for people

416
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,760
who read the book Start Up Nation

417
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,960
for the first time.

418
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,800
And they really understand that, Wow.

419
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,560
Like a nation of now Nine million people

420
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,600
in this heart of conflict is able

421
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,440
to produce such magnificent work.

422
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,400
I think that's a major major part.

423
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,240
And obviously,

424
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,320
the Jewish studies is important.

425
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,960
But I also think that combining that

426
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,040
with the intellect and combining that

427
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,520
with the successes,

428
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,440
I think that's incredible.

429
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,480
Right. I think so, also.

430
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,320
The trick is trying to figure out

431
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,060
how to convince that

432
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,560
the American Jewish community

433
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,080
that they should get what we call

434
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,560
the nakhat from the startup nation.

435
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,180
What is that? The what?

436
00:17:44,182 --> 00:17:45,480
Nakhat.

437
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,800
Oh, nakhat. Yeah. Yeah.

438
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,840
That they should feel

439
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,080
that it's theirs also, right?

440
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,960
I think that's the key that's missing.

441
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,880
So, it's wonderful to read about

442
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,480
The Startup Nation,

443
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,600
but if you feel that it's not you,

444
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,520
then you're just reading

445
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,040
about somebody else's success,

446
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,120
which might be inspiring.

447
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,360
But if the Jewish community can embrace

448
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,280
the notion that that is who they are.

449
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,000
In other words,

450
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,600
the people living in Israel are part

451
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,160
and parcel with the Jewish people.

452
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,040
And it's one body.

453
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,600
And therefore, they should feel

454
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,760
that it's their success.

455
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,560
I think that's something

456
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,920
that we're trying to achieve.

457
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,720
Is there a worry

458
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,560
that within this centrality

459
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,760
and pulling together as one body,

460
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,680
that the Jewish people

461
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,080
can start alienating

462
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,440
or continue alienating others

463
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,800
around the world who then view

464
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,840
the Jewish people as

465
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,800
this closed group, closed minded?

466
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,160
Is that a worry that we have?

467
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,280
Or do you not think that's the case?

468
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,120
I personally don't worry

469
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,400
so much about that.

470
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,880
I think that if you look at Jewish history

471
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,480
over the span of the thousands of years,

472
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,360
for most people, they weren't interested

473
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,440
in us integrating into them, right?

474
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,000
That was never a desire per se.

475
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,600
And in terms of today,

476
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,200
where people are willing

477
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
to allow us to integrate.

478
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,920
I think that people

479
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,680
have a certain element of respect,

480
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,880
as long as we're prepared to share.

481
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,800
Meaning, if we were isolated

482
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,920
to the point that we develop technology

483
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,160
that we weren't exporting

484
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,560
to the rest of the world,

485
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,640
then that would be a problem.

486
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,440
Or if we had morality and ethics

487
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,720
that we weren't prepared to share

488
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,840
with the rest of the world,

489
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,960
that would also be a problem.

490
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,840
But the stronger that we become

491
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,840
as a people, the more influence

492
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,120
we can have on others for the positive.

493
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,040
And I think that that's something

494
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,240
that they would also embrace.

495
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,800
Okay. Okay. That's fascinating.

496
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,640
So, Rabbi, we just have

497
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,200
a few minutes left.

498
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,920
But I'd love to get to know,

499
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,800
what is your favorite teaching?

500
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,000
The thing that you enjoy most teaching,

501
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,160
whether that's at Stanford

502
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,520
or through the JSN.

503
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,240
Like your number one classroom idea.

504
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,080
That's a great question.

505
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,200
I love teaching the Torah.

506
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,040
And specifically, there is one section

507
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,840
in the book of Devarim of Deuteronomy.

508
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,600
I'd love to learn.

509
00:20:05,602 --> 00:20:07,120
About the Va'etchanan,

510
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,040
Okay.

511
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,400
And if someone were to ask me,

512
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,760
"Rabbi, if I can only come to one

513
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,000
of your classes one week of the year,

514
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,400
which should I come to?

515
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,040
I would tell you to come

516
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,080
to that particular class.

517
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,320
And the reason is because

518
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,040
it contains all the fundamentals

519
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,680
of Judaism pretty much in one place.

520
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,960
Okay. So, give me in one minute thing.

521
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,720
What is the fundamental

522
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,680
according to you with that?

523
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,920
So, I think the fundamentals are that

524
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
there is a God who created the world

525
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,800
and he demands a level of morality

526
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,160
and obedience from us.

527
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,040
That we believe that

528
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,400
he took us out of Egypt,

529
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,120
not so that we would be free of anything,

530
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,720
but that we would become slaves to Him.

531
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,360
Meaning, that we would live our lives

532
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,200
with a sense of purpose.

533
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,600
And that God created the world

534
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,920
with a sense of purpose.

535
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,280
And our job is to help

536
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,080
fulfill that mission.

537
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,480
That's some of what you can get

538
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,280
from that parsha.

539
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,080
And do you find that

540
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,360
that is sometimes also

541
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,200
could potentially alienate people

542
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,120
who are Jews but don't come

543
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,700
from that background?

544
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,280
Who might come in and say,

545
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,120
"As a secular Jew, I'm hearing like,

546
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,240
Wow. Be slave to God and go

547
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,040
with the purpose of fulfilling his mission."

548
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,960
So, how do you balance that with

549
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,520
trying to bring in Israelis

550
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,680
and helping them understand Judaism better

551
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,000
and be more fond of it?

552
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,160
So, I'll tell you the truth.

553
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,800
I think the more that people study,

554
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,320
including secular Israelis,

555
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,720
and there are a lot of secular Israelis

556
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,120
that I study with.

557
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,280
The more they start to realize

558
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,680
that there is a lot of brilliance

559
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,440
and there's a lot of wisdom,

560
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,280
and they start to realize that

561
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,560
there's a system that is incredible,

562
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,440
that is incredibly progressive,

563
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,880
that doesn't fit anyone's

564
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,320
preconceived notions when it comes

565
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,840
to all sorts of issues.

566
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,960
I think, unfortunately,

567
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,480
Judaism is a bit of a victim

568
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,800
of being slapped together

569
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,960
with other world religions.

570
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,160
And, so people are familiar

571
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,000
with other religions.

572
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,680
They assume the same applies to Judaism

573
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,040
and they don't realize that there is

574
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,480
a different take on all sorts of,

575
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,400
really all sorts of issues.

576
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,920
Everything from women's issues,

577
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,720
to financial issues,

578
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,680
to the issues of

579
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,600
how to structure an economy, right?

580
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,000
The fact that Judaism is capitalistic

581
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,040
and yet it has a way of

582
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,640
defending capitalism

583
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,320
so that it supports everybody, right?

584
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,600
It's a very intricate structure.

585
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,840
The more people spend time studying that,

586
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,960
the more they start to realize

587
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,720
that there is a lot of value in it.

588
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,240
Interesting.

589
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,640
So, what I would say is I would encourage

590
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,720
people like yourself

591
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,640
to just take a little time

592
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
and investigate.

593
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,640
And I think you'll be pleasantly surprised

594
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,240
that it's something

595
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,320
that you'll find meaningful

596
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,000
and it will help inform the way

597
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
that you interact with people.

598
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,200
For many people, they find

599
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,760
that it helps with their marriage.

600
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,440
It helps them as parents.

601
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,400
It helps with the way that they

602
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,360
interact with their community.

603
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,000
And people feel that there is

604
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,120
a more meaningful purpose for life.

605
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,800
Right. And I definitely,

606
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,680
the number one thing

607
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,680
that I take from this is also

608
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,000
this idea of open mindedness.

609
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,200
And I'm definitely holding myself

610
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,800
to be open minded and learning anything

611
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,240
and everything that I can.

612
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,080
And I think one of the issues

613
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,120
with religion in general is that

614
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,800
people come with preconceived notions

615
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,680
or little soundbites.

616
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,840
They come up with conclusions

617
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,320
and then they have their belief

618
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,680
with those conclusions.

619
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,840
And I think that this investigation

620
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,480
is something that we all owe to ourselves.

621
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,640
By the way, not just necessarily

622
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,240
through Judaism.

623
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,880
I would love to also investigate

624
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,640
the Koran a little bit

625
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,080
and investigate Christianity

626
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,120
and understand the world

627
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
a little bit better.

628
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,240
And I think actually, that's one

629
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,200
of the key aspects of empathizing

630
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,320
and solving a lot of these conflicts

631
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,680
that we have is being able

632
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,120
to understand each other better.

633
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,320
Rabbi Joey, right before we leave,

634
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:40,920
I have to ask you

635
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,520
the most important question.

636
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,920
Three words that you would use

637
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,880
to describe yourself.

638
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,320
This is the most modern question

639
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,760
and probably the most difficult question.

640
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,560
100%

641
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,440
So, I would say that I'm Passionate.

642
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,800
Yes.

643
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,120
I would also say that

644
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,080
I consider myself to be God-Fearing.

645
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,240
Okay. What does that mean?

646
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,520
Meaning that I try to live

647
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,680
with a consciousness of the higher power

648
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,640
that we call God.

649
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,960
That's aware of what it is

650
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,040
that I'm doing.

651
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,840
It helps me do the right thing,

652
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,720
even though sometimes

653
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,640
I'd be tempted to do things

654
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,920
that are not necessarily right.

655
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,360
Okay.

656
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,480
And I think the third is,

657
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,720
I would say that I try to be

658
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,160
incredibly Open and Creative.

659
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,040
I love that.

660
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,320
Rabbi Joey, thank you very much.

661
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,000
Toda raba.

662
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,600
Thank you, Michael.

663
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,520
Stay safe and stay healthy.

664
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,720
Okay. You too.

665
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,800
Bye bye.

666
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,000
Bye.
