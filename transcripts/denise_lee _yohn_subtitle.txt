1 Okay. Denise Lee Yohn, thank you so much for being on my show. How are you? I'm good. Thank you so much for having me. I am extremely excited to have you. Brand leadership, culture, messaging, best selling author of Fusion, and What Great Brands Do. You assist so many different companies on their brand leadership and messaging and culture that I'm so excited to pick your brain in the next 20 minutes on what that even means. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and what is branding in general? Yeah, yeah. Well, so the number one thing you need to know about me is that I love brands. I've been very passionate about brands, not only as a consumer or customer, I have my favorite brands, but as a professional. I really try to understand how brands really engage people, seduce people, invite people into their community, into their world, and people, both customers and employees and other partners. And so, you ask me about the definition of branding, and I actually, frankly, don't use the term branding. Because I think that, branding, if you think about where it came, where the term came from, it was when, back when people had cattle and ranches and they would brand their cows with their logos so that people would know that the cows belong to them. And that's really not what is necessary or appropriate or compelling in today's [--]. We're not putting our logos on things just so that people know who owns it or who it belongs to. What I consider to be brand building is much more about what you do and how you do it. So, it really becomes very much a part of your business strategy and your operations, and to your point, your culture and your organization. So, why is this even a topic that needs discussion? Why do so many people and companies struggle with exactly what you're talking about? Yeah. Well, I think a lot of companies still do think about their branding, so they'd think about: what should our name be, what should our logo look like, what should our website look like, what should our colors be, and all of that things are important because we are communicating and trying to engage people through communications. But if you don't have the strategic foundation of what you stand for, what your values are, how you're engaging your employees to deliver great customer experiences, and what is your differentiation and all of that, then you really don't have a brand. You don't have something that is meaningful and valuable and that really can create that connection for you. Talk to me a bit about your journey. How do you even get started with becoming passionate about this topic and helping others then overcome it? Yeah. So, I studied liberal arts background. And in college I was a psychology, political science double major. And my first job out of school was in marketing. I was a market research analyst. And so, my first few jobs were really foundational, in a sense of learning in market research, learning to understand how consumers made decisions and how companies could communicate with them to influence those decisions. I also did some product management. So, really figuring out how do you research and develop products and how you bring them to market. And then I worked in the advertising agency to really figure out how do you create the creative communications and the engagement with customers. And out of all those experiences, Sony Electronics recruited me and I end up starting up their first ever brand office. Wow. And it was there at Sony, that I really learned so much about the value of internal organizational alignment and engagement. At the time, this is back in the 90s, so I'm definitely dating myself, but Sony had just started to see some chinks in the armor as Apple was rising. And the thing about Apple is that their emotional connection and their ability to just create this relationship with their customers is so powerful. And Sony definitely wanted to compete on that. But without the internal understanding of how were we going to do that, what does Sony really stand for, what do we really have to offer, we couldn't compete on speeds and feeds anymore because Apple and other players, definitely, were doing [--]. So, what was that emotional connection that we create. And we, internally within Sony, didn't have one common understanding of that. There was no way we were going to build to deliver on that externally. So, I learned a lot about that at Sony. And then for a variety of reasons, which I can tell you over a drink sometime, I end up resigning my job and starting my own brand consultancy where I can start consulting practice. And do that for quite a few years, had some opportunities to work on these great brands that you were referring to. And then over time have really shifted from doing a lot of consulting and a little bit of speaking and writing, to doing mostly speaking and writing and then just a little bit of consulting. Right. So now, getting this message across and helping others understand engagement better and culture. And then why is engagement difficult internally within a company? So, I'm now asking as a young entrepreneur, as I go through my journey of hopefully building a company and thinking about culture myself and growing the team, I now get to be a part of 8200 in 70 person team in the hypergrowth company and seeing the culture, what are some pitfalls that the leaders make when they're trying to engage both their consumers but also their employees? And then, what are some important things to keep in mind? Yeah. Well, actually, a lot happens in that journey that you just described. Because I think that when you were small and just starting up, you and your co-founders probably have a really clear vision on what you want to stand for and the kind of company you want to create. But I think that, often what happens is either: a, you take that for granted and as you add more people you just assume that everyone gets it; and or B, you get so consumed with operations and development and really trying to build a business that those things overtake your desire to create this great organization. And so, in the scaling process, you lose that focus on really what are we about and really what are we creating. And so then you wake up one day, and like you say you have 200 employees and you're like, oh my gosh, and our culture sucks. And you were competing in this brutal war for talent and we are trying to offer an experience to our employees that may or may not be competitive. And so, I think that you really need to, as a leader of your organization, as one of the people who's driving the growth, you need to be very intensely focused on prioritizing culture building. Understand it doesn't just happen. And we need to be not only talking about it all the time to make sure that you're clear on the kind of culture you want and the kind of organization you want, but then also role modeling that culture. So, you can't just be all words. You need to be action. And then finally that, you are actually designing and running the organization to cultivate that kind of culture. So, which departments or which groups in your company need to be working together better or you need to make sure there's really tight alignment integration and make sure that you're cultivating that in the way that you run the organization. Are there certain employee experiences or employee rituals or artifacts or policies and procedures, all of these things you need to be thinking about as you put those in place to make sure that they represent and really support and advance your desired culture. So, culture building really is a strategic leadership responsibility that you as a founder or as an entrepreneur need to be accepting that responsibility and championing it. I think that's fascinating. I heard you speak at a few other occurrences and a lot of the times, it's this idea that, yeah, we can put posters on the wall that scream our culture and our messaging. But then actions speak louder than words. And when I think about brand and when I think about what a company expresses, people always think outside of the company, how are outside consumers going to interact with our products. But then, I think people also forget, and I sometimes forget that at the end it's the people building these products have to live by these experiences and by these messages so that they can develop the products that other people will be happy about. What are some common themes that you're seeing as startups are scaling, with the pitfalls that leaders are making as they're losing out of the culture? Is it simply that they forget or do other things come in the way? Yeah. Well, oftentimes they'll delegate it to someone. So, again, as a founder or leader, you've got lots of responsibilities. And so, you think, "I can't do everything." "I'm going to hire good people to work for me." And certainly, you need to have a strong goal to execute your strategies and to help you implement your tactics. But you can't, as a leader, ever abdicate your responsibility for culture building. And if you don't give, let's say you have a head of employee experience or head of HR, if you don't give them the tools and investment and resources they need to create this great employee experience, they're going to be hamstrung. And so, their effectiveness is very much tied to your buy into this. So, it's really important for you to make sure that you are continuing to lead. The other things, I think, is to understand that your values as an organization need to be woven into everything that you do. Again, like I said, they can't just be words on a page. But you need to be applying them, especially to your people decisions: who to hire, who to fire, who to promote, who to develop. And you need to be using your values as a filter or as a screen for your people, not only because that will make sure that you have the right people on the right positions doing the right work, but that's also probably one of the most important or most influential ways that you share your values with the organization. If someone sees you saying that creativity and risk taking is important, but you are always penalizing people when they fail or you're actually firing people because they failed or they took a risk and it didn't turn out, then people are going to be like, "Well, wait a minute." That value that you were talking about doesn't really seem to be a reality, really. Also you need to be thinking, okay, if this is the kind of value that I want to have my organization, the best way to show that I mean what I say is in my decisions about people. 100%. And I think it also speaks to the hire slow, fire fast. This idea that think about the people that are in the company, they're not just skillful people that are getting things done, but every hire is going to impact the culture. And obviously, the higher up in the ladder you go, the more critical it is. What are some incredible things that you've seen people do in order to create good engagement with their employees or their customers outside? Some things that I might not even be thinking of as I'm growing my own company. I get a lot of examples from Airbnb because I did a deep dive into that organization when I wrote my book, FUSION. And so, they created an employee experience department where they brought in all the different functions that impact an employees, their day to day experience, and brought them together under one person and into one consolidated group, which meant that they were looking at the employee experience the way that you look at a customer experience, like the journey that employee has throughout their tenure. And so, they started their employee experience during recruiting, where in addition to all of the functional screens that someone has to go through as a potential worker, who also are interviewed twice just based on values. And that way the company really gets to know what your values are and gets to assess whether there's alignment with the company's values. And what's really interesting is: a, that these values interviews are not done by the hiring manager, they're done by members of a committee specifically designated towards values reviews; and two, if they decide that this candidate is not a fit culturally or is not aligned to the values, they can actually override the hiring, even though those person could be absolutely the right skills, right experience, the company is not going to hire them. So, I mean, it's like having a very prescriptive, strict standards that enables a company like Airbnb to attract the kind of people who really believe in the mission and who work by the values. And then on the back side, in the recent months, Airbnb had to lay off a lot of employees. Yes. And the way that they've done so, in the letter from Brian Chesky, just the humanity and the compassion and empathy that was demonstrated through that is another sign of how seriously the company takes the employee experience and [--]. Definitely. 100% So, you made a conscious decision yourself to transition your experience from that of building the brand of a certain company and culture of a certain company to now looking in the broader picture about a lot of different companies. So, first of all, I'd love to hear about this transition. And why are you so excited about the work that you're doing now? Yeah. Well, I felt like I could have a lot more impact on a lot more companies if I were to increase my speaking business and increased my writing, and really just try to get my ideas out more. When you work for a single company or when you do the kind of brand consulting that I first was doing when I first came out of Sony, there is deep dive into the organization. And so, you can really affect change within that one organization. But I felt like I was limited in a way, and especially because, unlike maybe the folks who are listening to this interview, I wasn't going to grow a big company. It was just going to be me. I wasn't going to have any employees. And the rate limiting factor is my bandwidth. So, if I were to impact the most people that I can, it's going to have to be through speaking and writing. And it turns out that I think when I did a lot of self-examination about what I got excited about and what I found life-giving, what I felt like I really wanted to get better and better at, like it was a passion of mine to really hone my skills set, it was speaking. It was really getting out there in front of people and figure out how do I share what's in my head and all the research and experience that I've had and be able to communicate that in a way that they understand. That's just fascinating to me. 100%. So, that's what gets me up every day, really. I love it. I did love that challenge. I love it. So, alongside that messaging, so Fusion, What Great Brands Do, tell me a little bit about each book and what I can expect to find in there. And maybe one or two nuggets that we can extrapolate from each. Yeah. Yeah. So, What Great Brands Do, the seven brand building principles that separates the best from the rest. Now this book came out in 2014 so some of the examples are a little bit dated, but I continue to hear from people today how informative these seven principles are because it really takes with you some counter-intuitive practices of brand building. Like great brands avoid selling products. Like they don't push products on people promote features in a top-tier technology. They're much more, as I said earlier, into the business of seducing people and incline people in it and making an emotional connection. As my book shows you how to do that gives you some tools to bring what's in lots of case studies and examples. Right. My second book, Fusion: How Integrating Brand and Culture Powers The World's Greatest Companies, is about how you take your internal organizational culture and your external brand identity and ensure that they are mutually reinforcing and definitely integrated and aligned and intertwined in such a way that you really are on the inside what you say on the outside. Because then, not only do you engage your people really effectively, but you pass the customer test of brand authenticity. Because these days, customers want to know really what's behind the curtain and they have the ability to find out. So, you want to make sure that how you're operating the organization really is with integrity and authenticity. So, I highly recommend those two books. And then I will say for your audience in particular, I've written a small book called, parts of the paper really, a change this manifesto about minimum viable brand. It's all based on the minimal viable product. Yeah. But given that you're going to have limited resources and limited time when you're first starting out, what are the few things that you need to make sure that you have in place as you're building your brand. And so, all of these things can be found on my website and hopefully they'll be good resources for your folks. 100%. I think, everything you talked about is just fascinating. I think that today, especially in 2020, and we've seen it especially this year, how important company culture is both in terms of adapting to lay offs and a lot of the stuff that's been coming out over recent years in company culture is, I think, things that people in my years of studying and people in my age group that are starting companies we're very very conscious of. And we're always thinking, okay, from day zero, how do we get the right culture. And just the other day, my good friend who has just finished the Stanford Business School, he asked me, "Michael, what is going to be your schtick as a CEO?" "I'm going to be the Nature CEO, and that's the culture that I want to build in my company." And people are thinking of what types of the niche markets they like to address and what type of cultures and communities they want to build, I think that's amazing. I know that in the company that I'm with now, Hippo Insurance, the culture is incredible. And I'm really I'm fascinated to sit next to the CEO and I get to talk to him about the way that he addresses these problems. And every onboarding process is a new adventure and a new celebration by over 200 people, which is just incredible. But Denise, before we leave, I have to ask you the most important question, three words that you would use to describe yourself. Yeah, you know, Michael, that's such a hard question. It's the hardest one. And I don't prepare enough. So, I'm sorry as well. So, I have two and maybe a third one will come to me. So, definitely driven. So, I'll go with this driven. I am definitely like someone who sees a goal, sets a goal, goes after it. And two, I'm very disciplined. In the sense that I can have my way of doing things. My whole life is arranged in a way so that I can achieve my goals. And so, those are the two. I don't know the third one. I'm not sure, I would say maybe this is more than one word, but since I'm doing the [--], I'm dedicated to my faith in the sense that I'm a person of faith and I really am guided by my faith. And so, that provides the center and the core for me. So, I could have cheated and use more than one word on that last one. That's perfectly fine. I'm disciplined and dedicated to my faith. Denise, thank you very very much. This is fascinating. I can't wait to read these books myself. It sounds like it's something that's incredibly insightful for any young entrepreneur or any leader that wants to affect change in their own community, whether it's in a company or whether it's in the simple community, in their family or whatever it is. It sounds like it's relevant for a lot of different things besides business. Thank you very very much, Denise. I really appreciate it. Stay safe and stay healthy. Bye bye.
