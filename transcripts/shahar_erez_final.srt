1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,640
I don't think we live

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,040
in a world anymore

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,840
where there is one path

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,760
to drive successful life.

5
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,400
Entrepreneurs come from all shapes

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,320
and walks of life.

7
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,120
And we see that daily

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,120
with companies that thrive

9
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,420
and companies that, you know, perish.

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,960
Shahar Erez, thank you for joining me

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,120
on 20 Minute Leaders.

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,750
How are you?

13
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:47,225
I'm doing well.

14
00:00:47,226 --> 00:00:47,920
How are you, Michael?

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,360
Good morning.

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,200
I'm doing wonderful.

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,080
Thank you very much.

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,560
Let's talk about Talent.

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,360
Let's talk about the workplace,

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,320
talent, data driven talent acquisition

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,360
and hybrid models.

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,040
Because what you're doing

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,320
with Stoke Talent is fascinating.

24
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,240
But right before we get there,

25
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
let's go back to you journey

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,960
just a little bit.

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,240
From the Technion

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,400
and finishing 12 years of studies

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,880
getting your high school diploma

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,520
at the age of 22.

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,360
You will not really think

32
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,000
that a 22 year old graduate

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,600
will end up being

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,960
a successful tech veteran?

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,880
What is that about?

36
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,800
Neither did my parents.

37
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,920
They were pretty concerned

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,480
when I graduated high school

39
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,200
without a diploma.

40
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,280
But you know, during high school

41
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,120
my mind was at a different place.

42
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,520
I didn't enjoy studying.

43
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,600
Although I was registered

44
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,800
to study physics and computers,

45
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,320
it's kind of a great class considered

46
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,960
but my mind was elsewhere.

47
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,560
I was already thinking about going

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,480
to the military service.

49
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,320
And so, I actually didn't wake up

50
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,960
to my final math test in high school.

51
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,600
And so I never,

52
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,400
Wow.

53
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,680
I never officially graduated.

54
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,320
I did almost five years

55
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,080
in the military, various roles.

56
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,880
And when I left,

57
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,680
I think I was already

58
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
a little more mature

59
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,160
and understood that

60
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,480
if I want to do something

61
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,120
with my life,

62
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,960
I better complete that.

63
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,640
By the way, the day

64
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,040
that I left the military,

65
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,840
I remember my parents calling me like,

66
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,120
"If you want to double think that

67
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,080
when you don't,

68
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,520
you won't get any job outside.

69
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,000
Why don't you stick in the military?"

70
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,840
And so, I did leave the military.

71
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,600
I completed my high school diploma.

72
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,160
I did my math, physics exams.

73
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,080
And went and did my

74
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,200
psychometric exam.

75
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,680
I guess it's the equivalent of an SAT.

76
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,520
I got a pretty good score.

77
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,040
Kind of, you know,

78
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,320
combined with my military service,

79
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,920
paved the way to get

80
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,640
a full three year scholarship

81
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,080
for computer science.

82
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,960
Although I never wanted

83
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,040
to study computer science,

84
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,200
I thought it was going to be boring.

85
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,120
But somehow I got

86
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,000
a full three year scholarship.

87
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,760
And that's how I got

88
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
into computer science.

89
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,840
One thing led to the other.

90
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,200
And I was never a great engineer.

91
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,000
I never thought I will be

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,360
a great engineer but it gave me,

93
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,720
you know, it gave me insights

94
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,080
into this entire, back then you know,

95
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,920
high tech industry,

96
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,800
what does it mean.

97
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,000
And there's more than just coding.

98
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,440
There's an entire ecosystem around it.

99
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,320
Got to work with a lot of people,

100
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,320
startup companies, large companies.

101
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,640
How business get built around software,

102
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
the various elements that are required.

103
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,520
How do you build a product.

104
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,400
How do you go sell a product.

105
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,960
How you market a product.

106
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,840
And so, I was fortunate to work

107
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,720
from my perspective

108
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,000
with the best of the best

109
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,960
you know, joint companies

110
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,520
like Mercury Interactive.

111
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,440
I was mentored by leaders,

112
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:29,100
probably the best leaders in the industry.

113
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:32,079
People like [--], Amnon Landan.

114
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,373
Then in VMware,

115
00:03:33,374 --> 00:03:35,960
with people like Paul Maritz.

116
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,800
I was really

117
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,280
had the opportunity to learn

118
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,560
from these people.

119
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,640
How to think about business,

120
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,080
how to think about leading people,

121
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,800
what should you focus on,

122
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,280
what should you give up on,

123
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,120
what to insist and you know.

124
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,240
Shahar, would you do anything differently?

125
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,560
If you were to go back

126
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,880
to high school, middle school,

127
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,840
would you do anything differently?

128
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,280
You know, I'm not sure.

129
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,040
Yes, you might say I wasted some time.

130
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,800
But I don't think anything

131
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,560
could have been different.

132
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Some things need to happen

133
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,080
in their own pace.

134
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,120
The only thing I regret is

135
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,000
I never graduated quite cool.

136
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:15,640
Other than that I don't really care

137
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,120
about anything else.

138
00:04:17,121 --> 00:04:19,720
My kids now, I have three kids now,

139
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,360
all in their teens.

140
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,680
And although school is important,

141
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,280
we never really look at their grades.

142
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,800
I don't really make it a thing.

143
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,080
I think that there's so much more

144
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,840
at driving successful happy life

145
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,480
than you know, how much you scored

146
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,640
on your English, math

147
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,680
or whatever exam.

148
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,760
I think that,

149
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,840
I'm living testimony to someone

150
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,920
that flunked math in school.

151
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,080
And, you know, my parents

152
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,320
were called in to school multiple times.

153
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,880
It just took some time for me

154
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,880
to get settled in and, you know,

155
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,240
to find my way.

156
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:55,840
And I think that

157
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,440
the most important thing is to find

158
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,560
how should I say it,

159
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,280
find your passion,

160
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,880
be a good person.

161
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,680
And beyond that,

162
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,920
I mean, there's multiple things

163
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,600
that need to be done.

164
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,080
I don't think we live

165
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,520
in a world anymore

166
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,280
where there is one path

167
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,240
to drive successful life.

168
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,880
Entrepreneurs come from all shapes

169
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,760
and walks of life.

170
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,560
And we see that daily

171
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,600
with companies that thrive

172
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,880
and companies that, you know, perish.

173
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,880
And there's no one path for that.

174
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,652
It's not that you have to go

175
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:27,120
to these schools

176
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,880
and you have to study these things

177
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,920
and you have to take this track.

178
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,320
It's mostly about the person you are.

179
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,160
The interaction that

180
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,000
you are able to create with others.

181
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,840
Your ability to think outside the box.

182
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,680
I think that a lot of these things

183
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,880
are not things that you acquire

184
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,960
in traditional education.

185
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,040
But you acquire them

186
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,560
through different experiences in life.

187
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,320
Which, by the way,

188
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,600
would lead to some of my observation

189
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,880
around where the talent market

190
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
is heading.

191
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:54,880
A lot of who I am today is an outcome.

192
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,040
That is going to be my next question.

193
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,880
Obviously, it's not because

194
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,760
of what I've studied at school,

195
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,280
but it's because

196
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,560
of the experiences I had

197
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,680
both in school

198
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,200
and then in my military service

199
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,720
with the people

200
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,840
I had the opportunity

201
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,080
to interact with.

202
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,200
And then being fortunate to work

203
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,960
for the company

204
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,640
with the people I worked with

205
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,920
and how much I was open

206
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,960
to learn from them,

207
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,080
to get feedback,

208
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,160
to do better at what I do.

209
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,240
And it's not specifically

210
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
about getting this grade

211
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,960
or that grade.

212
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,840
It's one of the things

213
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,480
you study in Israeli air force is,

214
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,720
it doesn't matter how successful

215
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,800
your last flight was.

216
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,840
It's like, can you come off that flight,

217
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,000
spend time to research

218
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,600
what was wrong.

219
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,800
Research what went well,

220
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,400
keep what went well

221
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,440
and fix what went wrong

222
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,200
for your next flight.

223
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,480
And then on an ongoing basis,

224
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
how do you create

225
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,520
ongoing improvement.

226
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,226
You know, I think without

227
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:47,360
applying the specific approach

228
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,000
on a day to day basis,

229
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,160
this was the mentality

230
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,240
that I've absorbed

231
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,560
over the last 20 years.

232
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,520
Sometimes I succeeded to what I did.

233
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,760
And a lot of times I failed.

234
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,680
I've built products that didn't succeed.

235
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,400
I've built products

236
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,200
that were extremely successful,

237
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,560
but what can you learn from it.

238
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,840
Right.

239
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,520
I think one of the things

240
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,640
that I was always so hugely impressed

241
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,800
doing during my service

242
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,600
and I was always looking

243
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,120
at the Air Force debriefing methodology

244
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,960
that you were referring to.

245
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,480
And I think that it's been quoted

246
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,400
countless times by Eric Schmidt

247
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:20,840
and [--] and others,

248
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,880
they were talking about

249
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
this behavior mechanism

250
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,680
where it doesn't matter

251
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,520
if you succeeded or failed,

252
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,280
there's always something

253
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,840
to learn from this experience.

254
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,760
And unless you're very intentional

255
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,320
with the way that you debrief

256
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,800
this experience,

257
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,000
you can let the lessons

258
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,240
just fly by you

259
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,440
and then it's worthless

260
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,800
because you didn't learn anything, right?

261
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,160
Then where's the compounding learning

262
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,920
along your life.

263
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,960
And I agree.

264
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,720
It's so important there

265
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,120
and it's the debrief.

266
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,240
And one of the most important things

267
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,600
with that debrief is,

268
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,560
how do you debrief

269
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,280
leaving your ego aside.

270
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,920
Because we have this

271
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,840
internal defensive mechanism.

272
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,600
It's like, it wasn't me,

273
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,840
something else went wrong.

274
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,520
Right.

275
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,600
And I met at some point

276
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,520
it wasn't in my unit,

277
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,080
but one of the elite units

278
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,040
in the military.

279
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,360
And a friend there kind of told me,

280
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,440
It's the first thing you do in debrief.

281
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,080
It's like you go up on stage

282
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,680
and say, "I failed, I was wrong."

283
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,520
Once you do that,

284
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,080
you come with that approach,

285
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,640
then your egos aside,

286
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,680
and then you learn and evolve.

287
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,920
And I try to apply that.

288
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,440
And then moving on,

289
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
it's like 15 years later,

290
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,120
I heard Paul Maritz back at VMware

291
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,880
which is one of the nicest person,

292
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,280
one of the smartest person

293
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,880
people that I know and he said,

294
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,320
"How do you grow up as a leader

295
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,800
not spending every minute

296
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,880
at work trying to be

297
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,520
the smartest person in the room?

298
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,400
How do you leave that aside?"

299
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,280
It's like it doesn't matter

300
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,400
who's right, who's wrong.

301
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:38,600
How do you end a conversation

302
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,080
in a different manner?

303
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,520
And I think, some of it

304
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,000
has to do with maturity.

305
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,520
Some of it has to do

306
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,960
with obviously attitude and DNA.

307
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,880
But once you rise

308
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,800
to that level of not really

309
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,080
putting yourself at the center

310
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,560
but you're just a piece of that puzzle,

311
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,720
a lot of things inside and around you

312
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,720
start moving a lot better.

313
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,360
And I think that

314
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,120
that's very, very smart.

315
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,160
And I'm definitely taking that to heart.

316
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,440
Shahar, tell me a little bit about

317
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,920
your insights into the talent space.

318
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,280
What is the talent space to start with?

319
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,760
Because I don't meet many entrepreneurs

320
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,320
that are working in that space.

321
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,160
Yeah.

322
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,720
So, I'll tell you,

323
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,640
my, obviously my POV.

324
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:22,400
So, you know, I spent 20 years almost

325
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,640
in the industry leading teams.

326
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,520
Hundreds of people

327
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,640
in some of those phases.

328
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,200
And the one thing

329
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,520
that you see along the line

330
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,680
is the one thing

331
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,280
that I think distinguishes

332
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,760
super successful companies

333
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,920
with a less successful companies

334
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,520
is their ability

335
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,920
to deploy the right talent,

336
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,720
at the right project

337
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,640
at the right time

338
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,120
to produce the right results.

339
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,185
And what I've seen, and I work

340
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:45,640
for large corporates and small companies

341
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,400
is that it's very difficult

342
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,360
to navigate this talent pool

343
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
because the resources that you need

344
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,800
are not the resources that you have.

345
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,320
And then you start doing

346
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,120
you know, all this maneuvering

347
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,240
instead of fitting the business,

348
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,480
fitting your existing talent pool.

349
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,040
Back in 2013,

350
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,040
when I moved back to Israel

351
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,960
from California,

352
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,000
I started my own company

353
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,720
and we bootstrapped

354
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,080
because we can't raise any money.

355
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,520
And we started using online marketplaces.

356
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,000
It was early days for Fiverr.

357
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,796
oDesk was still

358
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:16,440
the leading platform, I think.

359
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,600
We started getting exposure

360
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,480
to different online marketplace

361
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,320
where you can find talent.

362
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,840
After a bit of trial and error,

363
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,400
because it gets time

364
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,880
to get adjusted to these,

365
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,160
we found tremendous value

366
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
in online platform.

367
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,320
Because all of a sudden

368
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,160
if I need something,

369
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,400
I have someone working on it

370
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:32,920
the next day.

371
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,160
Maybe they're not perfect for it.

372
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,080
But if I had to go and recruit for

373
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,120
somebody to do that job,

374
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,480
I'd be waiting three months.

375
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,880
Or we get something 70%

376
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,920
of the quality,

377
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,000
but starts working on it

378
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,240
within 48 hours.

379
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,160
And that kind of change,

380
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,760
Even less.

381
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,248
Yeah, even less.

382
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:49,200
It depends what you need. Right?

383
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,000
If you need a a piece of code

384
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,720
and sometimes you need

385
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,520
to qualify them and so forth.

386
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,360
But you kind of change

387
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,920
your entire month.

388
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,120
So, we built a company

389
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,200
that started getting traction.

390
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
At some point we decided to drop it.

391
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,880
But it wasn't because

392
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,280
we weren't able to execute.

393
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,440
At some point we had 18 people

394
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,400
working for us

395
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,320
all the way from New York, Rochester.

396
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,200
All the way to India, Bangladesh,

397
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,720
Indonesia, all over the world.

398
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,960
We had 18 people working for us

399
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,840
from design to coding.

400
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,440
And we found that

401
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,680
the ability to execute

402
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,640
grows exponentially

403
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,760
when you adopt that approach.

404
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,120
Further on, I joined back

405
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,520
into the corporate life

406
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,040
and try to apply that approach

407
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,960
into corporate, didn't work.

408
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,840
Corporates work on a different stages,

409
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
different processes.

410
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,120
And I found that to be

411
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,356
a disabler for companies

412
00:11:39,357 --> 00:11:42,480
to get to their full potential.

413
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,720
And we kind of said,

414
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,200
"What if we can connect this world

415
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,520
of infinite talent pools?"

416
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,080
Because really,

417
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,760
there's hundreds of millions

418
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,400
highly qualified people

419
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,600
around the world wanting to freelance.

420
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,120
On the other hand,

421
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,600
there is a need for talent,

422
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,800
how do we connect the two together,

423
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,200
not through the traditional marketplace

424
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,440
that exists right now

425
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,560
which is more of a consumer based

426
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,520
swipe your credit card,

427
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,760
get someone to do work,

428
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,540
but really in a robust manner

429
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:10,640
for what corporates need to do.

430
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,000
So, we embarked on this journey to say,

431
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,080
what if we built

432
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,280
an enterprise grade mechanism

433
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,000
that helps companies

434
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,400
A, take control over their existing

435
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,880
freelancers and contractors;

436
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,160
and B, augment

437
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,800
their existing execution processes

438
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,160
with external freelancers.

439
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,800
The biggest challenge

440
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,400
that we saw out there

441
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,920
was the internal organizational processes

442
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,040
for companies, unlike consumers,

443
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,200
require a different process.

444
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,400
Because, you know, Michael,

445
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,000
if you need someone

446
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,960
to do slides for you

447
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,920
or get a video for you

448
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,520
or swipe your credit card on Fiverr,

449
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,400
someone will do that for you.

450
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,480
If you want to do that,

451
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,520
we need Hippo, for example,

452
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,360
do you have the budget?

453
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,200
Do you have the permissions?

454
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,720
Do you know which paperwork

455
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,040
these freelancers need to sign?

456
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,120
Can you assure that IP will be owned

457
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,960
by Hippo at the end of the process?

458
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,080
There's a set of questions

459
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,520
that come with it

460
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,080
that the company has to comply with

461
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,200
to be able to take that value.

462
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,120
The best example I can give is,

463
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,200
think about Amazon 12 years ago.

464
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,640
You're young,

465
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
you're far younger than I am.

466
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,160
So, I don't know where you were

467
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,080
when Amazon emerged back in 2007,

468
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,720
give or take 2008.

469
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,680
But when Amazon started,

470
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,640
up until that point,

471
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,360
if you wanted to build

472
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,920
an application at a company

473
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,840
you needed to get servers.

474
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,120
To get a server,

475
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,440
you need to go to IT.

476
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,600
IT sent you back to finance

477
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,640
to get budget approval

478
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,840
and then you went back to IT

479
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,960
that gave you the spec

480
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,440
that they can support,

481
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,560
then you went and submitted

482
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,960
the purchase order.

483
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,240
Six weeks later, you had a server

484
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,120
and you could start coding.

485
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,360
The day after Amazon emerged,

486
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,840
if you wanted to build an application,

487
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,480
all you do is click a few buttons.

488
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,360
What has changed in the process?

489
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,320
You know, I think that actually

490
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,280
that exact different you know,

491
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,640
I experienced that being

492
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,360
in the 8200 units

493
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,080
where, you know, it's on prime

494
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,960
and it's still,

495
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:01,280
it's not there but we have to do it

496
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,480
and then a day after,

497
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,360
you know, getting out of it,

498
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,560
all of a sudden you have everything

499
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,480
in the click of a button.

500
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,760
So, that mental shock,

501
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,600
what you've experienced,

502
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,520
I think over 12 years,

503
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,960
I've experienced in one day.

504
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,120
But I think that's just the nature

505
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,960
of the different talents.

506
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,120
I agree.

507
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,000
And if you think about it,

508
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,400
the biggest difference,

509
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,680
I mean, it's not that Amazon

510
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,760
is far cheaper.

511
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,640
But there's two significant differences.

512
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,280
Number one,

513
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,720
everything that you do on Amazon

514
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,760
is fully tracked, sort of digitized.

515
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,360
You click a button,

516
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,200
you bought the service,

517
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,440
someone sees it,

518
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,480
someone can monitor it.

519
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,160
Someone can come to you

520
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,840
and say, "Hey, Michael,

521
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,040
did you buy this service?"

522
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,240
Everything is fully visible.

523
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,560
Nothing goes hidden.

524
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,960
Everything that you bought today,

525
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,400
you can decide

526
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,200
if you don't need tomorrow

527
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,640
you return it.

528
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,880
The same thing is now happening

529
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,840
in the world with talent.

530
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,800
If you need someone to help you,

531
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,400
I know what part of Hippo

532
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:47,920
you're working on,

533
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,560
if you need someone

534
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,840
an expert in NLP tomorrow

535
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,000
to help you solve a problem,

536
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,880
you can and go find someone

537
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,800
to help you solve that NLP problem.

538
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,920
It's going to cost you

539
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,640
a few hundred dollars.

540
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,720
It's going to accelerate your work

541
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,240
by three or four days,

542
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,960
and then you let him go.

543
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,200
It's the same exact thought process.

544
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,920
Everything is managed.

545
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,360
Just like but like you're mentioning,

546
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,520
there is a whole added layer

547
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
of complexity because

548
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,760
it's not just the expertise,

549
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,200
but there's compliance issues

550
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,000
with the data that we're working with.

551
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,520
And there is, you know,

552
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,440
a lot of it is based around the privacy

553
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,640
and the intellectual property

554
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,800
of the company.

555
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,880
And I'm assuming that

556
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,400
with an example like you're giving,

557
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,240
if you're requesting

558
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,840
the aid of an expert ad hoc,

559
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,520
then this is probably dealing

560
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,000
with some sensitive data

561
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,760
or some core business

562
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,640
that you really need to dig deep.

563
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,240
And therefore, you also need

564
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,605
to be extra careful with who

565
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:37,360
you are submitting the information.

566
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,400
That's a great comment.

567
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,320
And this is exactly where Stoke comes in.

568
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,400
Part of what Stoke built,

569
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,440
because we're optimized

570
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,320
for these corporates and companies,

571
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,120
is to help the company

572
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,680
set their policy.

573
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,880
Who's allowed to be freelancer

574
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,440
in the company,

575
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,360
what people do you need this time,

576
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,160
which states can they come from,

577
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,760
what validation and background check

578
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,560
will the platform run on them

579
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,640
before they get started,

580
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,720
all of that in a fully automated manner.

581
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,760
Another example I can give you

582
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,400
is think about when you're traveling

583
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,920
between Stanford and Tel Aviv

584
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,720
and wherever it is you're going,

585
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,440
and if you're going on a private trip

586
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,480
you're booking your flight through

587
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,880
an Expedia or Booking

588
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,560
or whatever platform

589
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,080
you're using for your personal travel.

590
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,040
If you're booking at trip for Hippo,

591
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,840
you're probably doing it

592
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,960
using a Trip actions, or that sort.

593
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,360
The difference is

594
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,000
at the end of the day,

595
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,800
everyone's boarding the same flight.

596
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,160
But the internal controls, mechanisms,

597
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,960
validations, policies, budgeting,

598
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,120
all of that is different

599
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,240
between a personal trip

600
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,960
and a corporate trip.

601
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,120
And this is where the corporate element

602
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,520
of handling talents and freelancer

603
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
is the layer that Stoke has built.

604
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,040
To make sure that everyone's working

605
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,200
for the company is valid.

606
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Everyone is legal, now with AB5

607
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,520
or Prop 22 in California

608
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,320
make sure that

609
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,440
they can actually be paid

610
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,920
as independent contractor.

611
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,140
Making sure they signed the right IP,

612
00:16:58,141 --> 00:16:59,680
documents. or you own your IP

613
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680
at the end of the process.

614
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,920
Make sure they got paid on time

615
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,480
so you're not violating

616
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,800
payment legislation.

617
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,400
This is exactly the layer

618
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,360
that we add.

619
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,160
So, if you or anyone else in the company

620
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,040
needs to get extra help or resources,

621
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,600
they don't have to go through legal,

622
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,160
finance, HR, procurement

623
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,000
and wait for months

624
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,480
before they can actually get going.

625
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
How do you actually create

626
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,400
that marketplace where,

627
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,040
because it sounds like the onboarding

628
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,840
for these contractors,

629
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,600
you can call them as well

630
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,320
as the companies,

631
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,440
is not a one click, right?

632
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,080
I mean, you have to vet the person.

633
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,640
You have to make sure

634
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,960
that they have compliance

635
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,160
with all of the taxes

636
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,440
and all the payment methods.

637
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,280
And you also have to make sure

638
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,640
that they're also sending

639
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,800
the right IP contract.

640
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,080
So, it does sound complicated.

641
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,640
How do you simplify the process

642
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,360
for both the contractor

643
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,480
and the company that contracts?

644
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,960
Great question. There's two sides.

645
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,360
A, we're not trying to become

646
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,440
a marketplace ourselves.

647
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm not pooling the talents myself.

648
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,760
Most of the companies,

649
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,800
we work with startup

650
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,600
by bringing on their own talent

651
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,070
to the platform, the freelancers

652
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:03,640
that they're working with right now

653
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,760
just to make sure

654
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,320
that they are complying with legislation.

655
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,200
And if the companies look

656
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,800
for additional resources,

657
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,600
then we're actually partnering

658
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,560
with the set of marketplace.

659
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,240
There's about six or 700 marketplaces now.

660
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,742
HBS just released a paper.

661
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:19,948
There's over seven hundred marketplaces.

662
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:21,564
Some of them are generic

663
00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:23,920
like UpWork, Freelancer.com, Fiverr.

664
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,720
Some of them are more specific

665
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,520
or verticalized.

666
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,440
From our standpoint,

667
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,080
we're not taking a dime off a freelancer.

668
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,400
So, for us we're okay working

669
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,680
with anyone in a marketplace

670
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,000
in partnership.

671
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,520
When someone is searching for talent,

672
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,240
we'll go search it

673
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,520
from multiple marketplaces.

674
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,200
And when the connection is done

675
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,640
between the company

676
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,560
and the freelancer

677
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,080
we'll make sure that

678
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,520
we vet the freelancer,

679
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,400
we make them signed the right paperwork,

680
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,320
everything is happening automatically

681
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,080
through the platform.

682
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,795
So, the work will not start

683
00:18:53,796 --> 00:18:58,440
before all that background check is done.

684
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,120
That makes a lot of sense.

685
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,960
I'd love to spend

686
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,920
the last few minutes that we have

687
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,560
talking a little bit about

688
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,091
your observation on the talent industry

689
00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:06,000
as covid hit.

690
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,040
So, everybody's talking

691
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,120
about working remotely.

692
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,520
You know, we hear that sentence

693
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,360
every other day.

694
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,000
But I'm curious to hear

695
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,160
with your outlook on the hybrid model.

696
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,400
And not just onboarding employees

697
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:18,840
during covid

698
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,280
but also onboarding freelancers.

699
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,440
And I'm assuming intuitively

700
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,360
that there has been

701
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,400
an increase in usage of freelancers.

702
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,600
And I'm guessing that

703
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,360
a lot of companies are realizing

704
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:29,920
that, okay,

705
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,920
if I'm finding people online,

706
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,320
maybe I don't have to find the person

707
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,560
that's sitting in the next street.

708
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,000
Maybe I can just hire the person

709
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,960
that is 1,000 kilometers away

710
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,200
but is a little bit cheaper

711
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,720
or has a different skill set.

712
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,200
So, what has happened

713
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,080
to your industry as a result?

714
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,320
So, first of all, the trend was there

715
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,360
way before covid started.

716
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,120
There was a report from 2018

717
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,560
in the United States,

718
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,800
over 2500 companies

719
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,560
without offices in 2018.

720
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,400
So, this is not new.

721
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,360
This remote thing

722
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,840
didn't start with covid.

723
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,880
What covid, and if you look

724
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,720
at the reports from the IRS

725
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,480
and Bureau of Labor Statistics,

726
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,280
the projection was that by 2025,

727
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,560
50% of the workforce in the US

728
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,400
will be freelancing.

729
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,200
And by 2030, 60%.

730
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,520
So, the trajectory is there.

731
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,160
This is way before covid.

732
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,960
Wow.

733
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,680
What covid has done

734
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,880
is accelerated a five year process

735
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,600
into five months.

736
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,800
And all the indications that we're seeing

737
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,880
by public companies

738
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,880
like Fiverr and Upwork,

739
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,760
by Gartner, McKinsey, Deloitte,

740
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,000
CNBC and Harvard now

741
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,040
is that we're seeing 20 to 30%,

742
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
depends on who you're quoting,

743
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,080
growth in the number of freelancers

744
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,520
by these companies.

745
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,000
There's too many grounds here.

746
00:20:43,001 --> 00:20:44,000
Number one is in set.

747
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,280
Everyone's remote.

748
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,480
So, does it matter if

749
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,680
I get someone to work remote

750
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,800
for me on payroll

751
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,880
or as a freelancer?

752
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,200
Obviously, there's a lot of benefit

753
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,840
in working as a freelancer.

754
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,480
It doesn't matter if

755
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,960
they're on payroll or not.

756
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,920
Add to that effect, generational shift.

757
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,360
Most of Generation Z

758
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,280
and a portion of Millennials

759
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,400
prefer to be freelancers

760
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,360
not be tied to a single employer.

761
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,680
Then there's a match of expectation.

762
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,280
Companies prefer the flexibility.

763
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,320
Individuals prefer the flexibility

764
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,240
because no one expects

765
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,440
job security anymore anyway.

766
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,920
So, why not have that flexibility.

767
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:23,080
And the last thing is that

768
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,520
companies are realizing

769
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,560
that it's super complicated

770
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,480
to run any projection.

771
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,400
They don't know how they're,

772
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,280
what is going to happen next year.

773
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,600
So, getting into commitment

774
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,680
with full time employees

775
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,040
versus keeping flexibility

776
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,160
in a world of changing skill sets,

777
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,600
there is expectation that skill sets

778
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,680
will change every two to three years.

779
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,000
And so, do I really need to spend now

780
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,480
getting people on board

781
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,280
that will be with me

782
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,160
in four to five years?

783
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,000
Maybe it's not the right thing

784
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,480
for the company anymore.

785
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,320
We're seeing average time

786
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,520
tech employees spend at the companies

787
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,680
has dropped one point nine years.

788
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,520
Just under two years,

789
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,480
if you think about it.

790
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,280
That's the average time

791
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,000
someone sticks to a company.

792
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,160
So, why not build a flexible workforce

793
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,000
that has 60, 70% of its employees

794
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,520
as full time employees,

795
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,320
and the other 30 to 40%

796
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,480
keeps changing on an ongoing basis.

797
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,033
Every research shows,

798
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,960
freelancers are more up to date

799
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,520
with changes in the industry.

800
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,320
They're more passionate

801
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,040
about what they do.

802
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,680
They execute faster.

803
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,200
And they on board three times faster

804
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,840
compared to traditional employees.

805
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,560
Because they're doing it constantly.

806
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,400
So, if that's the case,

807
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,280
then go on freelancers.

808
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,560
Start working with them.

809
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,600
If they're great at what they do,

810
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,280
try to convince them

811
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,000
to become full time employees.

812
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,240
And if they don't, get someone else.

813
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,560
I think that that's

814
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,320
an amazing way to end.

815
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,600
And I'm convinced.

816
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,960
So, Shahar, thank you very, very much

817
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,560
for this time.

818
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,960
Thank you for teaching

819
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,080
a little bit more than

820
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,040
a lot more than I knew

821
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,360
about about this industry.

822
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,240
And I think the way you're doing

823
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,040
at Stoke Talent

824
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,440
makes perfect sense to me.

825
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,520
Especially with the trajectories

826
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,320
of where we're going.

827
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,360
And covid-19, as you said,

828
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,840
it just accelerated it.

829
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,880
The trend was already there.

830
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,480
I've been actually using

831
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,600
oDesk since 2013.

832
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,480
When I had my high school startup,

833
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,480
we had almost 50 people

834
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,320
in India and Pakistan

835
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,960
that were working ad hoc

836
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,800
on all these various tasks

837
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,880
because we were four high schoolers

838
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,000
and we needed more support.

839
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,800
And we didn't even know

840
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,200
how to get real employees.

841
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,040
But it was very easy

842
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,280
to swipe a credit card

843
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,480
and pay somebody from oDesk.

844
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,360
I wish we had Stoke back then.

845
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,520
So, if my co-founders

846
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,320
are listening to this,

847
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,600
they know exactly what I'm talking about.

848
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,720
Shahar, before we leave,

849
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,160
I have to ask you for three words

850
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,600
that you would use

851
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,680
to describe yourself.

852
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:45,480
I'd start with assertive, empathetic,

853
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,861
and visionary.

854
00:23:47,862 --> 00:23:51,600
Although it sounds like, you know,

855
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm a bit exaggerating about myself.

856
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,320
But that's how I usually approach things.

857
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
I look at the long term.

858
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,000
I love that.

859
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,120
And it comes definitely across

860
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,680
in this conversation that

861
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,160
a lot of it is long term thinking.

862
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,000
And I love that.

863
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,240
But if I had to say one thing again

864
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,440
as a tip for others,

865
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,720
it's like empathy is keys.

866
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,600
Like, it doesn't matter what you do

867
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,760
and how you trying to build it.

868
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,240
And you're working for Hippo.

869
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,242
And Assaf is a great example of

870
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:23,520
beyond being the visionary and the leader.

871
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,360
And he's one of the smartest

872
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,520
people I know.

873
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,720
It's like the first thing

874
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,760
is to be a mensch.

875
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,400
In Yiddish,

876
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,960
a mensch is like be a decent person,

877
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,680
be a kind person.

878
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:37,280
Everything else is [--].

879
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,080
I'm very excited

880
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,360
to send this to him now.

881
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,480
Shahar, toda raba.

882
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,760
Thank you very, very much.

883
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,480
And stay safe and stay healthy.
