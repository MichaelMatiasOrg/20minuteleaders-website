1
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,166
Daniel, thank you so much for joining me

2
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:46,499
on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,999
Thank you for having me.

4
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,766
It's so good to have you.

5
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:49,832
Where are you calling from right now?

6
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:50,699
Tel Aviv.

7
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,099
Tel Aviv. And how is everything

8
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,999
with the quarantine and with covid-19?

9
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,899
It's seems reasonable now actually.

10
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,099
We're starting to see the end.

11
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,999
And people and more going outside.

12
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,432
And yeah, I'm pretty optimistic around that.

13
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:06,966
At the moment.

14
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:08,366
Fantastic. You know, this interview

15
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:10,399
is going to be published in a few weeks.

16
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,532
So, I'm always curious to see

17
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:15,566
how the state of during the interview time

18
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:17,232
and then, what actually happens

19
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:18,232
once its published.

20
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:20,499
So, let's hope that everything

21
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,399
is open by then.

22
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,699
And everything's wonderful.

23
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,499
Daniel, you're working on the one of the

24
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,599
coolest companies that I know.

25
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,332
And that's because I'm a fitness and health

26
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,599
sort of fanatic myself.

27
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,999
I used to be so passionate about

28
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,199
what I put in my body.

29
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,666
And how I treat myself.

30
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:37,932
And now with the quarantine,

31
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:39,466
I've been indulging in a little bit

32
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:41,832
more pizza than I should.

33
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,399
All of us. All of us.

34
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,832
Daniel, you know, before we get into Lumen,

35
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,366
give me a brief roundup on everything

36
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,632
done up to now.

37
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:50,666
Because you're a seasoned entrepreneur.

38
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:51,899
You've had a lot of experience

39
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,332
before coming to Lumen.

40
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,866
And then let's dive in to this

41
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:58,366
incredible device that you've created.

42
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:01,099
Okay. Okay, so I'll try to be brief.

43
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,766
So, I've been entrepreneur for the

44
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:06,766
past 16 years.

45
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:10,232
So, Lumen is my third company.

46
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:14,832
But talking about founder, it's the second.

47
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,399
But kind of my professional life

48
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,799
this is almost all I did.

49
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,832
Before that, as kid in the boy scouts

50
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,699
love people interaction and so forth.

51
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,932
And then the navy. As a navy officer.

52
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:30,066
Wow.

53
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:33,532
So that's I think kind of gave me

54
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:35,532
a certain skill sets to

55
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:37,466
that I work pretty well with people.

56
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:38,299
Yeah.

57
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,999
But nothing professional really

58
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,332
to dive into.

59
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,232
And I think I became a good learner.

60
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:48,299
Around those period of time.

61
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,866
So, that's it.

62
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:52,999
So, my journey began very naively.

63
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,866
In 2005, I sits next to

64
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:00,132
at the first day of school in university,

65
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:01,066
in IDC in Herzliya.

66
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:04,999
I sit next to my founder today

67
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,099
and partner for a lot of time.

68
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,066
We sat next to each other.

69
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:11,466
His name is Dror.

70
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:14,332
And very naively we started talking

71
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,466
about doing something on the internet.

72
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:18,099
And we build something.

73
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,566
We build a product.

74
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:23,366
We found our missing link,

75
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:25,999
the technical guy who was

76
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,666
was our CTO in all companies,

77
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,199
and stills is. Avi.

78
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,166
And we build kind of a search engine.

79
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:37,732
A very visual one.

80
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:40,166
That helps people kind of browse through

81
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:42,666
the top websites in every category.

82
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:45,799
That was the first initiative.

83
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,066
We've made every mistake possible

84
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,432
in a book.

85
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,466
We build a product. Never launched it

86
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:52,266
for two and a half years.

87
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,632
We was tweaking it and improving it.

88
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:57,599
No one ever experienced that.

89
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,632
And then we launched it to

90
00:09:58,633 --> 00:09:59,832
TechCruch shipT.

91
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,966
And at the time we launched it,

92
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:03,132
we decided that no one

93
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:04,666
will actually use that engine.

94
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:08,866
So, there's better one out there

95
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:09,866
And we killed it.

96
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:11,732
And immediately got start pitching

97
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:13,066
something else basically.

98
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:14,466
The second day of the conference,

99
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:15,432
we started pitching something

100
00:10:15,433 --> 00:10:17,732
completely different.

101
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:20,332
And that thing was a tool for website

102
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,499
and publishers to integrate apps

103
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,432
into services into their platforms.

104
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:27,866
And that was our second company basically.

105
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:29,599
That was Wibiya.

106
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,599
And Wibiya was kind of fairytale story.

107
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,566
Two and a half years.

108
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,332
Raised about $2.5 million.

109
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,532
Then actually sold it to another company.

110
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:42,932
Another Israeli company called Conduit.

111
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,532
And stayed there for two and a half years.

112
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:48,799
And then, the three of us left and

113
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,466
started basically three months later,

114
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:54,932
started working on Lumen.

115
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:56,399
So, Daniel you actually went

116
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,266
with your two co-founders throughout this

117
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:00,332
whole entrepreneurial journey for 15 years.

118
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,799
Which is also is not that common.

119
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,066
So, I actually saw that from

120
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:08,199
The Top Reasons Why Companies Fail,

121
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,366
one of the top reasons is that

122
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:11,999
Founders have a dispute at some point.

123
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,966
and they part ways.

124
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:15,232
But you haven’t experience here.

125
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:17,566
Do you think that you sort of, the time

126
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,032
that you were all in the army

127
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:20,832
not necessarily together but you all went

128
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,532
through this camaraderie experience,

129
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:23,599
and you learn what it takes

130
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,832
to work with people even if

131
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:25,766
you don’t necessarily see

132
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:29,099
I try and everything?

133
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,232
I'm not sure it's the army.

134
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,899
I think it's the type of person

135
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,766
that you worked with.

136
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:36,232
And not necessarily the army.

137
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:39,066
Yes, the army maybe gives you some

138
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:40,566
skills around that.

139
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,232
But you can take it from a lot of places.

140
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:43,699
And it's mainly the people you choose

141
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,332
to work. And to be honest it's also,

142
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,966
it's a process. Right?

143
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:48,499
Oh yeah.

144
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,766
All of a sudden, a lot of ego on the table

145
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:52,866
when we've starting working together

146
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,999
and everything was much much harder.

147
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,332
And yes, we're fortunate to continue together.

148
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,099
But for Lumen, what we did

149
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,866
was even more, was more dangerous.

150
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:05,632
That's basically, Lumen was incubated

151
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:06,899
in my house.

152
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,466
So my spouse Michal,

153
00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:10,366
and her twin sister Merav.

154
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,299
They basically they're babies.

155
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,666
So, they are the science nutrition.

156
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,699
the physiology.

157
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,432
Everything smart behind what we do.

158
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:22,299
I fell in love with the concept.

159
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,766
The concept of measuring and understanding

160
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,399
something that really happens in my body

161
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,366
that potentially will have an impact on

162
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:30,366
on the way I train.

163
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:31,066
On the food I eat.

164
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:34,266
And on my health in the future.

165
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:35,466
And I was fascinated by that.

166
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:38,699
And fortunately, I have a very good teacher.

167
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,832
Every evening on the couch,

168
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,299
explaining to me the science

169
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,232
of how physiology works and everything.

170
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:47,632
And somehow, I don’t know how I got

171
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,966
my co-founders Dror and Avi to join me

172
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:50,999
into this journey.

173
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,332
I know how I told them a very big lie.

174
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,399
In the sense I told them,

175
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,566
"Listen, it's going to be a breeze.

176
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:01,499
It's hardware. But we get the sensors.

177
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,166
We get design. We do a kick starter.

178
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:05,099
After a year, we have a product out there.

179
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,532
That was 2014.

180
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,966
And it only took a six years

181
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:11,832
to get the product out eventually.

182
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,999
But we did.

183
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,266
I love it. I love that story.

184
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:18,899
So, where is Lumen right now?

185
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:24,032
So, May 2020, what's happening with Lumen?

186
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:25,632
Lumen started in 2014.

187
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:27,199
But actually in a way,

188
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,766
Lumen is really starting now.

189
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,166
We launched a product to our backers.

190
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:35,132
Who backed us on Indiegogo.

191
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:37,432
10,000 of them.

192
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:39,399
In 2018. Yeah, 10,000 of them.

193
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,966
And kind of middle of 2018.

194
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:45,432
It took us a lot of time

195
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:49,632
but we delivered the product in January.

196
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:51,299
Most of the products brought to customer

197
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,266
in January and now we're actually

198
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,232
feeding from their feedback.

199
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,699
And continuously improving the product.

200
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,332
And very soon, in about two weeks’ time,

201
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,332
We're going to publicly launched

202
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,632
what we're doing after we get some feedback.

203
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:10,399
And we got more inventory to sell.

204
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:10,899
So yeah.

205
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,666
Lumen is still middle of the journey.

206
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:16,966
but for people of outside of the company,

207
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:18,832
in a way, it's just a start. Just the beginning.

208
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:19,766
Oh, I'm sure.

209
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:21,832
So, first of all Indiegogo.

210
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:22,699
I don't get to meet many people

211
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,166
that have launched such

212
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,432
successful campaigns on Indiegogo.

213
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:27,332
I mean, 10,000 units sold.

214
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,732
That's a lot of confidence.

215
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:32,066
And a product that hasn’t been launched yet.

216
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:33,532
What was that experience like?

217
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:36,266
Going on crowdfunding and trying

218
00:14:36,267 --> 00:14:38,132
to get the public to really buy

219
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:41,232
into this idea of this hardware

220
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:42,632
that's gonna help you gain control

221
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,466
over what you put into your body.

222
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:49,599
Yeah. It was fascinating because,

223
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,566
you know we’ve been pitching this concept

224
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,499
and we're actually been testing it

225
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,966
with prototypes since 2017.

226
00:14:57,967 --> 00:15:01,232
But still, for someone to take money

227
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,466
out of the pocket and pay for something,

228
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:06,499
for a device and really engage with it

229
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,966
that was, you really need to understand

230
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:10,432
how you're going to sell this.

231
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:13,332
And why would people buy it?

232
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,699
And we really didn’t want this

233
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,066
to be a concept of this is a cool gadget

234
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:21,499
that you just buy or another gadget.

235
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,199
We wanted this to be tied into something

236
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,099
people care about.

237
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,132
And nutrition is something people are

238
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:28,499
deeply passionate about.

239
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,832
There is a community of people who are

240
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:34,532
obsessed about it for different reasons.

241
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,866
Working out. Losing weight.

242
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:41,632
And so we took a shot at this.

243
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:43,866
Basically not positioning this as a device

244
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:46,999
that can do thousands of things.

245
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,399
But actually more capturing and showing you,

246
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,166
If Lumen is in your hands,

247
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,232
how can you use it?

248
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:55,099
What's the value for you?

249
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,499
And I think, as opposed to many other campaigns

250
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,332
that are basically showcasing technology,

251
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,432
we were a lot more focus on the experience.

252
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:07,832
And we kind of knew that

253
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,799
the experience we were offering

254
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,332
is something that people will actually

255
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,132
be using and succeeding with.

256
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:18,832
So, that's I think the theme to that is

257
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:23,199
pre-solid start to work on a campaign with.

258
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,966
To be honest, I didn’t do a lot in the campaign

259
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:28,632
It's also finding the people who are

260
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:30,266
talented around that.

261
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:35,232
And my partner Dror has led this concept

262
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:36,899
almost completely alone

263
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,432
with a very selected few.

264
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:42,099
And he did the phenomenal job.

265
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,932
Definitely. Definitely.

266
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:45,499
So, give in a few sentences,

267
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,766
what am I experiencing when I hold

268
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:49,399
Lumen in my hands and trust me

269
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,899
I'm gonna be holding Lumen in my hands

270
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,799
sooner or later.

271
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,599
Okay. So, yes.

272
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,932
This is Lumen basically.

273
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,566
It's a very small device

274
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:00,799
that you can carry with you.

275
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,432
or just put in your stand.

276
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:06,132
And you breath to this in the morning.

277
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:07,099
It's not a normal breath.

278
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,032
You inhale air through it.

279
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:11,266
And everything is guided through enough.

280
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:13,299
You hold the air in your lungs

281
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,532
for ten seconds and you exhale.

282
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:17,099
And what Lumen does is basically

283
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,266
sampling the CO2 content of your breath.

284
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:22,532
And through that, it basically reflects to you.

285
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:24,899
Whether you're currently using fats

286
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,932
or carbs for fuel in real time.

287
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:30,266
And it changes. Right.

288
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:31,532
Our body can use fats and carbs.

289
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:33,199
And those are two different fuels

290
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,732
for probably different goals in a sense.

291
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:40,332
But, what you want to be doing

292
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,799
if you're waking up in the morning

293
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,832
on s fasted state, you want your body

294
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,399
to be using fats.

295
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,966
Because night time is the time for the

296
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,532
body to transition to fat burn in a sense.

297
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:54,166
So that's a first moment in the day

298
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:56,899
that you can get a sense of

299
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,666
control freely what's happening.

300
00:17:58,667 --> 00:17:59,666
What happened yesterday?

301
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:00,899
Have you been eating too much?

302
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,199
You ate too late.

303
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,199
You drink alcohol in the evening.

304
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,632
Stress. Sleep deprivation.

305
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:08,766
All of those are preventing you basically

306
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:15,766
from getting into fat burn in the morning.

307
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:16,866
But then, what do you do with this information?

308
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:18,532
So, let's say I get this information.

309
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:20,699
Okay. Yeah, fine. So, I'm burning carbs.

310
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,066
I'm not burning fat. What do I do now?

311
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:27,299
So, what Lumen provides you with is

312
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,366
a kind of actionable insight

313
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:30,432
on what you should be doing.

314
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:32,566
So you get a nutrition plan for today,

315
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:33,599
what you should be eating.

316
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,866
You should follow that.

317
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:37,732
It's insightful around workouts.

318
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,566
It's insightful around how much carbs,

319
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:41,832
proteins, and fats you should have.

320
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,766
And it actually, gradually becomes

321
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:46,266
more and more actionable

322
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:49,466
the way we design the product.

323
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:50,066
And once you followed that,

324
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:52,399
you measure again the next morning.

325
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,599
And you start seeing the change.

326
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,566
So, it will piss you in a way.

327
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:57,666
There is a learning experience

328
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:00,232
in that journey of self-exploration.

329
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:03,166
And it teaches you what works for you.

330
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:05,032
Which not necessarily will be the thing

331
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:06,666
that will work for someone else.

332
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:09,399
So, and how quickly will I see this change?

333
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,566
And how quickly will I see the progress

334
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:13,666
that I'm making towards my,

335
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:15,699
let's say my goals to burn more fats.

336
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,566
So, how quickly will I notice this change?

337
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:23,399
It really depends on you.

338
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,599
In a sense people who are insulin resistance,

339
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,766
or having sort of resistance,

340
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:32,466
who are pre-diabetic will probably

341
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:34,632
take a little bit longer to see the impact.

342
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,599
But generally, healthy people

343
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,366
it's a matter of days.

344
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,432
Of following a nutrition plan and seeing that

345
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:43,366
And it's an interesting feedback

346
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:46,099
because you can measure that very easily.

347
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,066
Okay. One night of playing poker,

348
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:50,499
eating pizza with friends.

349
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,632
You wake up on a carb burn very easily.

350
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:55,132
Which is okay, right?

351
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:57,399
It's a start of life.

352
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,566
But you wanna have the tool

353
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:00,599
that kind of guide you. Or the compass

354
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,066
that gives you direction when you're good.

355
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:06,832
When the things you did are impactful.

356
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,966
Or when it's not.

357
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:12,066
And you can get back on track with it.

358
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:13,799
Definitely. So, two questions here.

359
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,666
Because changing human behavior,

360
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,399
and changing consumer behavior

361
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,099
is difficult. It's almost impossible.

362
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,032
I have the pleasure of working with

363
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:23,532
Dan Ariely at Irrational Labs

364
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:25,499
a few years ago, and our research

365
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,532
and our work was centered around,

366
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:29,699
How can we think of consumer behavior

367
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,832
on technological products and guide for

368
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,332
different behaviors based on

369
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,166
what we're doing?

370
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:38,032
And part of Dan's premise is that

371
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:40,399
you know, we are irrational beings.

372
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,966
It's very hard for us to change our behavior.

373
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:44,766
But it's much easier for us to

374
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:46,932
change our environment which will

375
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:48,566
force us to change out behavior.

376
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:51,632
So how do you perceive users

377
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:53,866
adhering to this nutrition plan

378
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:55,899
and changing their behavior's the result of

379
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,932
seeing these results on an app?

380
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:00,066
Is that something that you really think

381
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:00,899
is gonna happen?

382
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,499
Or have you been seeing that it's happening?

383
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,032
We're already seeing it's happening.

384
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:07,066
But it's a process of designing.

385
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,332
So the device is really only the first phase.

386
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,899
Right?

387
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,632
The experience that the users go through,

388
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:13,599
in terms of insight,

389
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,766
and what should he do about it

390
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:16,832
as you said rightfully,

391
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,266
it's happening in the app, right?

392
00:21:18,267 --> 00:21:19,666
That journey is really happening through

393
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:21,432
content in the app.

394
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:22,499
Sure.

395
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,799
I can give you an example exactly pointing

396
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,166
to the point that you're raising.

397
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:28,566
When we launched this,

398
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:31,432
or gave it to beta users of early batches,

399
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:33,332
we told them, "You can measure in the morning."

400
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,599
And before lunch. And after lunch.

401
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,699
Before workout. After workout."

402
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,132
We gave them tons of opportunities

403
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,832
to measure and understand stuff.

404
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,632
And it was a bit overwhelming to them.

405
00:21:45,633 --> 00:21:47,099
And then what we did is,

406
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,066
What is the ritual?

407
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:49,699
The one ritual that we need to nurture

408
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,366
that will become maybe the default.

409
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:57,132
Basically, we have a potential to capture

410
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:59,832
a moment of the users’ day.

411
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,932
When is that going to be?

412
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:04,299
And how much value we can

413
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,366
focus on that moment?

414
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,366
And that moment is morning time.

415
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:10,566
We find that morning time at fasting,

416
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:14,532
there is something, there is a,

417
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,166
it's a mindful moment that you can take

418
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:20,099
for yourself and people can get used to it.

419
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,066
Basically, like brushing their teeth, right?

420
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:24,566
Behavioral change is hard but people are

421
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:26,932
relatively okay with brushing their teeth.

422
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:29,099
I hope.

423
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,599
And so, I think wellness rituals,

424
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,666
have a potential to make an impact

425
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,632
and to become habit

426
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:39,699
if there is a feedback loop, right?

427
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,766
It's easier to some extent

428
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:43,366
if you can measure something

429
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:45,832
that gives you a reflection of

430
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,999
what's happening and where you're heading.

431
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,066
Totally. And I think that goes back

432
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:53,366
to a lot of research by [--]

433
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:54,099
and have information.

434
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,432
And atomic habits that I've read recently.

435
00:22:57,433 --> 00:22:59,499
But how do you do these incremental steps.

436
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,999
And one of the most important part

437
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,032
of habit formation really is this idea

438
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:05,266
that you have this quick feedback loop.

439
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:08,099
And you can see this very incremental

440
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,066
small progress every day.

441
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:11,132
Because a lot of people who are,

442
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:12,099
let's say, are trying to lose weight,

443
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,799
which I guess is very common use case

444
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,699
for people who want to use Lumen.

445
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,066
If they don't see their weight drop,

446
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:20,366
within a a day or two,

447
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:22,932
it's because it's very hard to continue

448
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:24,666
this ritual.

449
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:27,032
But if you can guide them on a daily basis,

450
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:29,599
of okay, you've now transitioned a little bit

451
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,099
more towards the fat burning zone

452
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,166
That makes sense to something that

453
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:34,966
could be very beneficial.

454
00:23:34,967 --> 00:23:36,666
Yeah, that's true.

455
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,232
And I can say that in the past six years,

456
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:40,699
we struggled a lot about weight loss

457
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,866
in general. Right?

458
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:44,399
Because what happens when weight loss

459
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,132
when you succeed? Let's say it works.

460
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:49,199
And you lose a couple of pounds,

461
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,866
and so why will you use Lumen in a sense?

462
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:56,999
And what's the value of that ritual?

463
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,432
So, what we focus on is really

464
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:02,066
about metabolic flexibility.

465
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,499
and metabolic health.

466
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,466
And this is a constant evolution of your body.

467
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:09,766
Our metabolism changes on a daily basis.

468
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:12,399
But also really like being in shape

469
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,599
and out of shape, right?

470
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,766
If you run every day, you're in shape.

471
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:16,866
If you stop running for a week,

472
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:18,899
you're a bit out of shape.

473
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,099
You're not completely out of shape,

474
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,332
but you're trailing into this.

475
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,432
The same happens with our

476
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:26,366
metabolic flexibility or metabolic health.

477
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:29,932
Our ability to use carbs or fats as a fuel,

478
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:32,399
is they're available or not available.

479
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,266
Fats from our own stores.

480
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:38,266
And that is something that never dies.

481
00:24:38,267 --> 00:24:39,532
In a way, that's something that you can

482
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:41,066
constantly improve.

483
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:42,732
And the nutrition journey people

484
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:46,299
take upon themselves is one that is

485
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,066
dynamically changing. They start to workout.

486
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:51,032
Their metabolism changes.

487
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:53,599
They fly. Now, no one flies.

488
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,866
But they fly and they get jetlagged, right?

489
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:59,532
So, they go on a vacation.

490
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:05,966
So, in a sense that's how we see the future.

491
00:25:05,967 --> 00:25:07,466
Even if people come to lose weight.

492
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:09,232
What we've get them hoped on

493
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:11,299
eventually is metabolic health.

494
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,699
Which is something sustainable.

495
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,532
I love it. Okay.

496
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:16,666
So, the second it comes on Amazon

497
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:17,932
or whatever you're selling it,

498
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,566
please let me know so I can be one

499
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:21,099
of the first people to purchase it. I will.

500
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,466
It sounds incredible.

501
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:23,566
And as a person who,

502
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,032
I'm very dedicated to my health.

503
00:25:25,033 --> 00:25:27,966
I'm working out and doing a lot of these

504
00:25:27,967 --> 00:25:30,099
a lot of these research on my own.

505
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,099
It's definitely something that we need.

506
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,399
And it's something that I would find

507
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,266
so useful because that unknown

508
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:38,266
and that feeling of control that you don’t

509
00:25:38,267 --> 00:25:40,032
really feel like you have over your body

510
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:41,499
throughout your life.

511
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,032
I think that’s something that’s

512
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:45,332
really really wonderful.

513
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,699
Daniel, before we go. And I can’t believe

514
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,732
20 minutes are almost over

515
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:49,499
because I have so many questions.

516
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,466
I want to ask you

517
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:52,332
the most important question.

518
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,766
Three words that you would best

519
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:55,599
describe yourself. Or that one of your

520
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,132
co-founders would describe you at.

521
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:01,399
So, I'll be honest.

522
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,032
I thought about it.

523
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:03,166
Because that's a tough question.

524
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:04,032
I think it's a good one though.

525
00:26:04,033 --> 00:26:05,166
It's the hardest question.

526
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:06,866
It's the hardest question.

527
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:10,832
So, I think Optimistic would be one.

528
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:13,766
I'm definitely optimistic in everything I do.

529
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:15,399
15 years as an entrepreneur Daniel.

530
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,466
Come on. You have to be optimistic.

531
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:18,832
Yeah. You have to be optimistic.

532
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:22,666
And in doing some stuff that are

533
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:25,766
really off the trend.

534
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:26,632
You know, wellness is a trend.

535
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:29,766
But hardware, no one will invest in hardware.

536
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:31,232
Especially the early stages.

537
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:34,532
It's really hard to build a company that is

538
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:36,666
doing consumer behavioral changes.

539
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:39,299
Between hardware and so forth.

540
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,932
So, optimistic is one.

541
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,832
I'm a Learner. I love it.

542
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:46,599
I look at every experience I'm going through

543
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,132
as a learning phase.

544
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:50,599
If it's the dynamic with the team,

545
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,066
or if it's understanding CO2

546
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:55,366
and CO2 sensors and so forth.

547
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:58,599
And the last one is a leader,

548
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,032
but it's an Aspiration.

549
00:27:00,033 --> 00:27:01,632
So, I aspire to be a good leader.

550
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:03,832
But not good leader for the community.

551
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,866
Good leader for my team in a sense.

552
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:10,099
So, this is my focus. And I hope I'm on a

553
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,199
trajectory to do a good job there.

554
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,732
Daniel, toda raba. Thank you so much.

555
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,366
And more success to everything.

556
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:17,099
It sounds amazing.

557
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:44,133
Thank you. Sure is.
