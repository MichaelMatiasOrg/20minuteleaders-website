1
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,200
Meagen Eisenberg, thank you so much

2
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,360
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,000
How are you?

4
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,480
I'm doing well. Thank you.

5
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,600
Thank you for being here.

6
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,240
So, you're so so busy.

7
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,720
I mean, just the track that you've done

8
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,640
and the things that you're doing now

9
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,560
with TripActions,

10
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,240
a company that I love so much,

11
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,440
as the chief marketing officer.

12
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,000
And previously

13
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,880
the chief marketing officer of MongoDB.

14
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,400
And Vice President at Docusign.

15
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,600
So, really fascinating things.

16
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,880
And what I'd love to talk about

17
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,880
for the next 20 minutes,

18
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,400
is to hear a little bit about your journey

19
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,280
and about the role of the CMO,

20
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,800
and how you've watched different companies

21
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,560
scale their marketing efforts

22
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,760
through time.

23
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,080
So Meagen, maybe you can give me

24
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,760
a little bit of background

25
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,560
about who you are

26
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,080
and why are you so passionate

27
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,720
about marketing?

28
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,120
Yeah. Since business school,

29
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,760
I went to undergrad

30
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,920
was MIS computer science,

31
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,400
but I pivoted to business

32
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,480
during business school

33
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,160
to marketing for tech companies.

34
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,800
And haven't looked back.

35
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,080
I love it.

36
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,720
I definitely have picked up skills

37
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,280
along the way.

38
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,000
Started out in product marketing.

39
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,040
Switched over to really

40
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,840
lead generation, demand generation,

41
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,360
understanding what it takes

42
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,080
to build pipeline

43
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,280
for your sales team.

44
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,760
And then more recently, as a CMO,

45
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,160
learning more on the brand

46
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,880
building corporate communications.

47
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,160
And I think

48
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,480
when you look at companies that scale

49
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,880
and when you come into a company,

50
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,720
there's three things

51
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
I'm trying to figure out

52
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,960
that I need to focus on

53
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,080
between hiring the right people,

54
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,960
because to scale you need

55
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,080
the right skill set and marketing

56
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
has a lot of functions

57
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,360
that are very different,

58
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,520
whether it's product marketing,

59
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,280
corporate marketing, demand and growth,

60
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,720
web systems, operations, and then

61
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,080
localization for Europe and Asia.

62
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,320
So, people's number one.

63
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,440
Process, making sure

64
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
you have the right process

65
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,120
around launches,

66
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,520
partnering with your sales team,

67
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,960
lead flow. And then technology.

68
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,680
We have over 25 different technologies.

69
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,960
And about every company I've entered,

70
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,120
whether it was DocuSign,

71
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,080
MongoDB, or TripActions,

72
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,840
I brought in a lot of MarTech

73
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
and complemented that

74
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,960
with a lot of SalesTech and partnering.

75
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,480
And that's where you get

76
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,960
a lot of insights and data.

77
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,720
And you can compete in the market

78
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,280
when you know what's going on.

79
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,240
And technology helps us innovate.

80
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,400
That's why we buy software

81
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,840
that gives us a competitive advantage.

82
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,000
That's why I love working

83
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,320
at tech companies,

84
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,400
because you really can take markets better

85
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,920
when you have information

86
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,000
and you know what's working

87
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,480
and what's not working.

88
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,520
So, talk to me a little bit about

89
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,160
this notion of lead generation.

90
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,840
Why is this such a difficult

91
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,960
and complicated subject?

92
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,920
Because to an average engineer

93
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,400
coming into the world of marketing,

94
00:09:59,400 --> 00:09:59,760
you say,

95
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
"Okay. Well, I've built a great product.

96
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,880
I have a landing page.

97
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,480
I can put some ads somewhere.

98
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,920
And yeah, everybody will just flock

99
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,760
to my product.

100
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,920
It should be pretty easy"

101
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,600
But I guess it's not.

102
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,120
Yeah. When it comes to scale,

103
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,360
that's getting to the masses,

104
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,960
and the masses don't always find products

105
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,800
the same way.

106
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,240
Sometimes they read about it.

107
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,040
Sometimes a friend tells them about it.

108
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,680
Sometimes they see it on social media.

109
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
Sometimes you email them.

110
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,920
Sometimes they're in at an event

111
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,360
when we used to do events.

112
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,040
And so, you've got to figure out

113
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,280
the persona you're targeting

114
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,160
that's most likely to buy your product

115
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,280
and get in front of them

116
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,360
so they're aware of you

117
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,880
and then they take an action.

118
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,000
And so marketing's job

119
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,160
is to understand who the buyer is,

120
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,240
why they buy you,

121
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,280
and then get in front of them.

122
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,200
They're fishing out in a big ocean.

123
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,000
So, you've got to figure out

124
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,920
where the fish are,

125
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,080
you have to have the right bait,

126
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,640
and then you've got to bring them in

127
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,280
and hand them off to sales to close them.

128
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,360
And is that the same process

129
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,720
when you're a 20 person company

130
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,640
and when you're a 200 person company?

131
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,120
Is it the same sort of pipelines

132
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,920
for trying to get sales?

133
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,760
No, it's not.

134
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,320
It's the same idea that you need

135
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,400
to understand the persona

136
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:05,960
you're targeting,

137
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,800
but when you're a 20 person company,

138
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,080
that's hand-to-hand combat.

139
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,160
That is who do you know

140
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,160
in your network that can get you

141
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,400
help you get introduced

142
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,880
into the first five, 10, 20 companies

143
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,160
that become customers.

144
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,680
And so, it's very targeted.

145
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,640
Direct relationships.

146
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,360
You usually have someone

147
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,440
in Biz Dev or sales

148
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,720
who's got these relationships

149
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,440
with that target audience,

150
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,560
whether it's IT or finance or HR

151
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,000
whatever

152
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,800
depending on who you're selling to.

153
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,400
And you get in and you solve problems.

154
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,320
And you're still trying to figure out

155
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,280
product market fit in the beginning.

156
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,600
So, it's hard to scale until you know

157
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,720
what is the core reason

158
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,680
people are buying you.

159
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,820
And you don't really know that

160
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,920
when you're a 20 person company.

161
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,280
You might get some bluebirds,

162
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,080
you might get some stuff,

163
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,200
but ultimately,

164
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,000
the product's gonna pivot

165
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,880
and shift around

166
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,400
until you lock on something

167
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,640
that many people want to buy.

168
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,600
And you don't really know that

169
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,160
in the early stage.

170
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,960
But how do you even go

171
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,360
about ... that persona?

172
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,400
Because, fine.

173
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,080
So, I have a few thousand people

174
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,320
that I know have purchased the product.

175
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,120
I know that they're using it.

176
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,840
I might be able to even have analytics

177
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,640
into their actual usage patterns.

178
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,200
But how do you actually

179
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,400
feel comfortable and confident

180
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,720
writing down who are the top promoters

181
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,800
or the champions of this product?

182
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,440
Yeah. I mean, who bought it

183
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,520
is the first one. Who signed the deal.

184
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,080
If you have that many customers,

185
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,040
go and talk to the admin or the manager.

186
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,400
Understand and really ask

187
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,240
in about five to six questions,

188
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,720
you can find out why they bought it.

189
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,960
And keep digging in.

190
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,440
And then ask your sales team.

191
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,320
They're gonna know, right.

192
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,600
Often they know who they want to talk to,

193
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,320
'cause they have a successful pattern

194
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,280
of the messaging,

195
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,600
what it resonates with.

196
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,320
So, talk to your best sales rep,

197
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,680
who do they want to talk to ultimately,

198
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
and then talk to your customers.

199
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,520
Why did they buy?

200
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,160
Who's the owner of the product?

201
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,960
What was the pain they felt?

202
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,280
Is it a HR pain?

203
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,440
Is it a finance pain?

204
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,560
Is it a marketing pain?

205
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,120
Depending on why they bought

206
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,920
your software, there's pain there

207
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,480
that you're solving for them,

208
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,280
and that's gonna be

209
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,240
the target audience.

210
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,560
Right.

211
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,040
So, within the companies

212
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,920
that you've got to be in

213
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,160
and from your understanding of the arena,

214
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,360
at what point do the sales

215
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,640
start to impact dramatically

216
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,520
the progression of the product?

217
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,280
So, at what point in the company

218
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,920
do the sales now come in

219
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,000
and they're actually becoming sort of

220
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,960
the product people,

221
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,120
because they are starting to know

222
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,240
the needs of the customers

223
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,160
just as well as the product managers

224
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,680
that initially designed the products?

225
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,760
I mean, I think if you've had

226
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,960
a lot of a bats, a lot of conversations,

227
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,800
a lot of demos, failures and successes,

228
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,160
you start to get very familiar

229
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,400
with the product.

230
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,680
But when you're scaling,

231
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,160
you often bring in new reps

232
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,520
who don't know the industry.

233
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,680
They're just good at selling.

234
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,720
So, it's your job in product marketing

235
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,160
and sales enablement to train them

236
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,000
or to bring in sales engineers

237
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,320
that really deeply understand the industry

238
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,000
and the product to help support them

239
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,680
and answer those questions

240
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,880
that they haven't brought up

241
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,560
to speed on. But part of market and sales

242
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,800
is to get your reps to be productive.

243
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
And part of being productive

244
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,920
is really knowing.

245
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,040
So there's sales training,

246
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,240
there's ramping,

247
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,440
there's a knowledge base

248
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,280
you've got to transfer.

249
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,720
And the faster you can do that,

250
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,920
the better you're going to do in sales.

251
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,080
Right. Right.

252
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,720
Okay. That makes a lot of sense.

253
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,280
Now, one of the things

254
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,200
that you touched upon before

255
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,000
was this whole notion of using technology

256
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,480
to leverage better sales

257
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,800
and better understanding

258
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,640
of what's happening.

259
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,600
So, what's happening today in 2020

260
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,040
that maybe wasn't available 15 years ago
- Oh my goodness

261
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,560
in the arena of marketing?

262
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,600
Or even 10 years ago?
- So much

263
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,880
I saw a talk you gave

264
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,280
seven years ago in 2013 on YouTube.

265
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,040
You were talking about

266
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,720
this whole idea of automated marketing,

267
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:33,960
right,

268
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,560
and understanding your customers.

269
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,120
And I was just thinking like, Wow.

270
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,160
How much has changed

271
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,360
in the past seven years

272
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,800
that you were talking about back then,

273
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,200
and now we're in 2020.

274
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,760
Yeah. I mean they always say

275
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,720
half of marketing spend is effective

276
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,040
you just don't know which half.

277
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,080
Well, since then we have a lot of software

278
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,360
that gives us attribution information.

279
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,040
You've got things like Visible.

280
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,680
You've got things like Full Circle CRM.

281
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,280
You've got tools that allow you

282
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,280
to analyze the workflow.

283
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,200
And on the sale side,

284
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,120
things we didn't have.

285
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,880
We have recordings from chorus.ai

286
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,600
and other vendors in the space

287
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,880
that analyze what's talked about,

288
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,760
how to respond,

289
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,760
you can see what they're talking about,

290
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,880
what the points are,

291
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,360
what the customer brings up.

292
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,760
So I can see how I need

293
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,880
to better train reps,

294
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,480
content they need,

295
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,640
customer stories they may

296
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,560
or may not have.

297
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Your website.

298
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,680
I mean the whole thing.

299
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,280
Most people will go to your website

300
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,720
at some point.

301
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,080
98% of all people go to your website.

302
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,160
But if you don't know who's there

303
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,280
and what they're doing on it,

304
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,440
that's something you didn't know

305
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,320
15 years ago.

306
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,880
But now we know who's on our website.

307
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,200
We know what they're doing.

308
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,280
How long they sit there.

309
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,720
What assets matter.

310
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,400
What helps them convert.

311
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,680
Are they going to the demo?

312
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,560
Are they not?

313
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,040
And we move things around and say,

314
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,640
"Oh, that captured a lot more people."

315
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,520
My job is not only

316
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,000
to get people to the website,

317
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,960
but to capture them

318
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,360
and get them in a active conversation.

319
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,920
Even to schedule a calendar.

320
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,200
We use Chili Piper.

321
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,120
They come, they say they want a demo.

322
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,120
Why wait for someone to call back

323
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,920
to schedule the demo?

324
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,800
It can open up their calendar

325
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,840
and automatically schedule it

326
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,320
between the SDR and the customer

327
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,200
or the prospect.

328
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,440
Right.

329
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,800
So like, take out all

330
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
the middleman stuff.

331
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,240
That's what we're doing.

332
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,760
Ads.

333
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,080
You spend a lot of money on paid search.

334
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,560
We now have something like

335
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,720
things like Terminus.

336
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,840
They only show ads to our target accounts.

337
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,280
Why waste money on companies you

338
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,520
don't want to target?

339
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,800
So, these technologies are making us,

340
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,520
giving us a lot more

341
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
insightful information,

342
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,040
so we see what's working and what's not

343
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,120
so we can be more efficient

344
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
on our budget.

345
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,280
And they help us target

346
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,560
who we want to speak to

347
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,080
that is the right personas,

348
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,360
the right companies

349
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,920
that sales wants to get in front of

350
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,960
and then streamlines the actual demo

351
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,720
getting them in front and them process.

352
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,920
And then are they effective

353
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,120
when they're in front of them.

354
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,840
So there's so many things available today

355
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,760
that we certainly didn't have before.

356
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,320
And that's what makes it fun, too.

357
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,760
I think it's a competitive advantage

358
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,680
to understand the technology landscape

359
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,080
out there and what you can use

360
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,680
to best your competitors,

361
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,160
because you just have more information,

362
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,440
you can move faster than them,

363
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,880
and you can automate stuff.

364
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,600
[crosstalk]

365
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,560
So, is this something that's now new

366
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,360
within companies?

367
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,940
That there are new divisions,

368
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,320
there are new roles for people

369
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,520
who are more on marketing analytics

370
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,600
and leveraging all these technologies

371
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,320
to be able to then guide

372
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,440
the sales representatives

373
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,640
or the chief marketing officer

374
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,720
on what the strategy should be?

375
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,280
Yeah. I mean, there's definitely more

376
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,160
technology focused folks in marketing.

377
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,720
I think when you're a 20 person company,

378
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,200
a lot of times your engineering team

379
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,840
is also doing your website.

380
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,880
But as you mature,

381
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,800
you should bring in

382
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,840
a dedicated web developer,

383
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,680
front end, full stack

384
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,880
so you can quickly learn, pivot, and edit.

385
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,840
And it's a living, breathing site.

386
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,320
It's really your lifeline

387
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,520
for your reps to get a funnel going.

388
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,040
And so, I think as soon

389
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,240
as you can bring in that team,

390
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,640
when you're large enough,

391
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,280
that's gonna be

392
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,800
a much more effective channel

393
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,280
than having to wait for sprints

394
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,880
for the engineering team to make edits

395
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,480
or even outsource it

396
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,800
to a consulting firm to do it.

397
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,480
They're not living and breathing

398
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,120
the day to day.

399
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,080
They're not working the 15 hour days

400
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,000
and the weekends with you,

401
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,200
right.

402
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,560
They're charging you for every hour

403
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,600
and you get so many a day

404
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,240
and it takes a while for them to respond.

405
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,280
In the beginning,

406
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,520
you need to be agile, responsive.

407
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,240
You want people

408
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,680
that own a part of the company

409
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,880
that are working really hard to build it.

410
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,400
You want the

411
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,920
I find it much better

412
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,080
to have them in-house.

413
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,360
No no, definitely.

414
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,160
It makes it just run much faster

415
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,120
and much more flexible.

416
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,480
But are things

417
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,920
going to change dramatically now

418
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,960
in the way of selling B2B

419
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,840
as a result of the new social norms

420
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,040
due to covid?

421
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,800
Because when I imagine sales,

422
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,520
the classic sales,

423
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,320
I imagine somebody coming in with a suit,

424
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,800
taking a few people out to dinner,

425
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,720
maybe a Broadway show,

426
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,320
pitching to them throughout the evening,

427
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,080
and then with drinks signing a deal.

428
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,800
I'm imagining that

429
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,720
it's a little bit different

430
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,160
in software B2B.

431
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,520
But are things changing at all

432
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,320
due to the covid situation?

433
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,960
I mean of course things have changed

434
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,920
in the short term.

435
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,320
I don't think that's a long term.

436
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,120
I mean, there's an Oxford study

437
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,800
for every dollar spent on travel

438
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,520
and going to in-person meetings,

439
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,760
you return $12 in revenue.

440
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,520
Companies are definitely taking a hit.

441
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,880
It's hard to build a relationship

442
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,640
over a virtual conference.

443
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,560
People will get back to meet in person.

444
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,000
C-level execs will travel.

445
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,800
As soon as you're in a deal cycle,

446
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,360
or you're about to lose a customer

447
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,880
to a competitor, I guarantee

448
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,600
you're gonna get on a plane and go fly

449
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,820
especially if it's an enterprise customer.

450
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,560
To me, you're not gonna wait for that.

451
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,480
And if we progress

452
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,320
and we have vaccines come out, I see us

453
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,040
We have customers already traveling.

454
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,800
So, there's industries health care,

455
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,840
retail, manufacturing,

456
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,640
they're all out on the road traveling.

457
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,080
Tech is sitting a little bit back

458
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,000
on the sidelines,

459
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,880
because I think we're tech savvy

460
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,280
and we're all over the technologies

461
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,840
that are out there,

462
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,000
but folks are out there traveling.

463
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,600
In the spring, even maybe winter,

464
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,000
if vaccines start coming out

465
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,360
and the comfort level goes up,

466
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,760
and we have

467
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,160
more and more knowledge every day,

468
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,320
people will get back to traveling.

469
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,800
Maybe it's 50%.

470
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,960
in the next year.

471
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,600
Maybe it's a year and a half to two

472
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,000
where it's back to full,

473
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
but I have no doubt people are traveling.

474
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,320
We have consumers out traveling right now, right.

475
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,200
I've already done a trip

476
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,240
to the East Coast and back in June

477
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,200
with my family for a vacation.

478
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,040
Like there are some of us

479
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,080
who have been on the road

480
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,200
that are comfortable.

481
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,520
We understand our risk.

482
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,360
We protect ourselves.

483
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,480
We wear masks.

484
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,480
We wash hands and all of that.

485
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,320
So, that's just growing.

486
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,280
People are not gonna stay

487
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,520
in their houses forever.

488
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,800
Human nature, we're just.

489
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,200
And we have way more advances

490
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,760
than people did 100 years ago

491
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,080
when pandemics and plagues

492
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,040
and everything else hit.

493
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
So yeah, it sucks in the short term.

494
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,560
And it's hard to sell.

495
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,400
I've no doubt it's a much harder job,

496
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,200
and if you're a relationship salesperson

497
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,720
that does the dinners and bonds

498
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,080
and breaks bread and all of that,

499
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,360
you've got a lock down

500
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,440
on your value prop

501
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,560
better than ever.

502
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,600
Your ROI, your customer case studies,

503
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,480
proof points.

504
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,000
For sure, value proposition

505
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,760
and messaging matter more than ever.

506
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,600
But we will get back

507
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,880
to the relationship side

508
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,360
because people want to work with people,

509
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,120
buy from people,

510
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,280
and you trust someone

511
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,960
that you've sat down with

512
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,080
and gotten to know much more

513
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,560
than the cues you miss out on over video.

514
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,720
Of course. Of course.

515
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,160
That just leaves me optimistic

516
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,920
after this conversation.

517
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,800
So thank you for that, first of all.

518
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,920
But I also want to talk a little bit about this

519
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,120
You were a protagonist

520
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,320
for a Stanford Business School case study

521
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,080
over MongoDB.

522
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,360
I've been really enjoying

523
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,720
taking some of those classes,

524
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,240
and every time we read the case study,

525
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,440
they're so fascinating

526
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,000
and it's remarkable.

527
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,200
And I can't believe you were a protagonist

528
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,280
in one of those case studies.

529
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,560
So, talk to me a little bit about that

530
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,120
and what that was about.

531
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,560
Yeah.

532
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,760
So, that was MongoDB.

533
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,240
It was when we scaled. We had

534
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,120
When Carlos and I joined,

535
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,320
we had less than 400 people

536
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,080
at the company.

537
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,840
Grew it to about 1,300.

538
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,000
Took it public.

539
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,080
But we had took the marketing team

540
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,080
from 24 people almost up to 80.

541
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,600
Put in a lot of different technologies.

542
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,280
Launched a whole new database

543
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,840
as a service atlas, which is

544
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,920
a totally different business model

545
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,960
than our enterprise product with MongoDB.

546
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,640
And really just bringing in,

547
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,840
we had to bring in the right people,

548
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,040
we had to bring in the right technology,

549
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,520
the right process to scale the company,

550
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,920
become a public company

551
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,600
that's doing quite well in the markets

552
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,680
today even.

553
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,680
And so, just all the learnings of that

554
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,440
and how you build that partnership.

555
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,000
The case study is a lot around the partnership

556
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,200
between marketing and sales,

557
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,960
the communications,

558
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,600
transparency, and results

559
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,560
that we were seeing,

560
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,200
a feedback loop.

561
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,920
And it's ever evolving

562
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,120
because the market's evolving,

563
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,480
the customers you go after are evolving,

564
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,720
and you need to just keep partnering.

565
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,280
I would say it's like a marriage;

566
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,720
you've got to communicate,

567
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,360
you've got to deliver value.

568
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,000
So, that's the main lesson

569
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,840
from that case study is

570
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,560
about communication

571
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,160
and about continuously evolving

572
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,560
within the organization?

573
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,480
Well, it's also about the technology

574
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
we implemented, what we needed.

575
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,680
It's about the process

576
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,600
that we put in place,

577
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,920
the methodologies,

578
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,600
how we built out a funnel,

579
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,920
fully evolving funnel, all of that.

580
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
I love it. Okay Meagen, I'd love to use

581
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,320
the last just four minutes that we have

582
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,360
to talk a little bit about you

583
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,200
and why you're doing what you're doing.

584
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,800
So, one of the things

585
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,120
that I love hearing about

586
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,560
and gaining so much inspiration from

587
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,080
is where people's passions lie.

588
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,240
So, why marketing?

589
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,760
Why chief marketing officer

590
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
of a hypergrowth company, a unicorn?

591
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,760
Why that specific position?

592
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,320
I think marketing

593
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,040
is always changing and really hard.

594
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,320
I think people think

595
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,840
it's events and billboards.

596
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,520
And it's not.

597
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,400
It's actually a mix of art and science.

598
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,360
It's you're dealing with people.

599
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,200
You're supporting

600
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,880
and enabling a sales team.

601
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,440
And they are forever changing

602
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,080
your understanding of customer

603
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,440
that's evolving.

604
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,520
You've got technical people on your team

605
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,560
to do your website, to do operations.

606
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,760
You've got product marketers

607
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,000
who are creating messaging

608
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,520
and positioning.

609
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,480
You've got brand

610
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,760
and corporate communications.

611
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,360
You're dealing with press and media.

612
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,760
You've got to do this worldwide.

613
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,360
So you have European folks

614
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,200
and localization in Asia.

615
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,240
And so I always say

616
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,880
marketing's like the circus

617
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,200
when you go and you put up the plates

618
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,960
and they're spinning.

619
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,320
And you start on one side

620
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,360
and you start spinning it,

621
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,240
and you get all the way around

622
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,680
and then this one starts to fall down

623
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,720
and the idea is to keep it up on the post.

624
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,400
So I always feel like no matter what,

625
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,080
once I get something going,

626
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,400
when I turn this way, all of a sudden

627
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,840
it starts to fall over here.

628
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,880
And so for me, it's just

629
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,520
it's never the same.

630
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,160
It's changing.

631
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,280
You launch new products.

632
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,960
You have new players.

633
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,520
And so I find it exciting,

634
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,440
and I love the creative side of it.

635
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,720
I think brand is fun.

636
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,480
What you have to do

637
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,880
to get people's attention.

638
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,600
It's hard.

639
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,360
There's a lot of noisy stuff going on.

640
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,600
Every channel is noisy.

641
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,840
And then you find a new channel,

642
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,040
you understand it, learn it,

643
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,000
and then a bunch of players

644
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,080
come in and crowd it.

645
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,280
And so, it keeps you up

646
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,720
on what's out there,

647
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,600
what's the technology.

648
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
I always think about how I buy,

649
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,640
what gets my attention,

650
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,880
and then how do I apply that

651
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,280
to my business.

652
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,600
And so, I love it.

653
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,760
I think it's very hard,

654
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,360
but it's stimulating.

655
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,600
So, what's like one or two things

656
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,720
that you do to remain updated?

657
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,520
Because you keep talking

658
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,840
about this idea of evolution

659
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,920
and being able to be on top of the game

660
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,680
and being at the forefront.

661
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,080
How do you personally do that?

662
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,040
Because today there's so many startups

663
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,640
in this domain.

664
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,360
So many different advances.

665
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,560
Yeah. I mean, I've advised

666
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,440
a lot of companies.

667
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,960
So, over 25 companies.

668
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,400
That's one way I keep up

669
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,080
on what's going on

670
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,200
'cause they have limited budgets

671
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,800
and their growth hacking

672
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,160
and I get a lot of ideas

673
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,560
and see a lot of things that you could do

674
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,440
without a lot of money.

675
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,640
Two, I have a pretty good network

676
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,160
with other heads of marketing,

677
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,520
VPs of marketing, and CMOs.

678
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,160
So, I exchange ideas with them

679
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,880
all the time.

680
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,040
There's a lot of office hours

681
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,600
and networking going on there.

682
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,280
And then,

683
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,840
I'm constantly following consumer brands.

684
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,240
I mean, how did that person

685
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,160
get my attention.

686
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,320
Whether it's in retail,

687
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,720
whether it's in activities,

688
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,240
things for my kids.

689
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,520
I have three daughters,

690
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,640
so they're active on TikTok

691
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,080
and YouTube and all those things

692
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,840
I don't want them to be on that they love.

693
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,680
And so, they're always giving me ideas.

694
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,680
And so it's a mix of things

695
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,560
that you see and hear.

696
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,760
And then I have a team, right?

697
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,120
I have a team of almost 30 people

698
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,200
that are always coming up with new ideas

699
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,840
that have different experiences.

700
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,680
And I'm listening and learning

701
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,440
and then testing.

702
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
Meagen, thank you so much

703
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,520
for being so generous with your time.

704
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,720
I really really appreciate it.

705
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,560
Right before we leave,

706
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,320
I need three words that you would use

707
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,240
to describe yourself,

708
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,160
and why those three specific words.

709
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,840
Yeah. I mean, one executive mom.

710
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,920
So I'm working,

711
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,720
but I have three children

712
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,600
which I already talked about.

713
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,360
So I think that's pretty obvious.

714
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,320
I love being in tech

715
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,000
and I love actually working.

716
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,080
And the third word would be hardworking.

717
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,160
I've always got something going on.

718
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,400
I like to be out there doing stuff

719
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
and learning and busy.

720
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,280
I think that advising 25 companies

721
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,000
and doing all the things

722
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,040
that you've done along your career,

723
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,120
I think it shows.

724
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,000
Meagen, thank you very very much.

725
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,320
Thank you for all the incredible work

726
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,480
you're doing and for the inspiration

727
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,800
And best of luck.

728
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,280
Thank you.

729
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,920
Thank you for having me.

730
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,400
Take care.
