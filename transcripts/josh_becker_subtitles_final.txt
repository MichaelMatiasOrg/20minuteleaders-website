Wonderful. Josh Becker, thank you for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? I'm very good. Thank you for having me. Thank you for taking the time to do this. I know you just got back from a long trip. So I really appreciate it and I know how busy you are. Brief background and then I'm gonna ask so many questions because I know so little about the things that you do. The scope of the things that you do but they're so fascinating. So Stanford Business School, but also a law degree from Stanford. Always thinking about public interest entrepreneurship. What does that even mean? I can sense by the name, but I don't really know. The Full Circle Fund, helping non-profits. I think you've deployed over a 100,000 hours of help through that. Incredible. And you're running for state Senate this year, which I also I'm excited to learn about what that transformation is like and what it means to innovate within government. Okay, let's take a break now. Josh, tell me who you are, please. Well, thanks. Yeah, this is really fun. I really appreciate you having me. Yeah and thinking about it I mean, there are things that run through all of that. And for me, it really is innovation. I love innovation in any respect. So, whether in the private sector, in the nonprofit sector, or now in the government sector. And for me there's really been a theme. I actually started out more on a public policy basis. I mean out of undergrad, I was really focused on environment. Environmental activism. Went to DC. Worked in policy. Worked at some campaigns. And it was almost a fluke, really, that I ended up in business school. But in the in-between time, I applied and I came out, I got involved with a guy named Jack Hidary starting early Internet company called Earth Web. And this was 1994, early days of the web. Bringing a physical computer over to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, showing them the Web saying, "Hey we'll build a website for you." And I got really involved. By the time I came out to Stanford in 1995. It's like, wow, this is really a great place to be. And so, I got really into innovation in the private sector in the early Internet days and ultimately in clean tech. And it became to see a way to really meld my common interests in the public good with innovation. And I did it both in what we call impact investing and this was the really early days. We started a fund in the impact investing space which actually is now growing. And we're focusing on businesses that had a real social impact. So, clean energy was one of them. Wow. But that's pretty, you know, I go to quite a few of the classes at the business school and a lot of my friends are at the Stanford Business School. It's pretty rare that somebody comes in there and goes out of there with the sense of responsibility of devoting most of their time to doing social good. I mean, there is a trend and a lot of people are saying, "Yes, I want my business to do social good." But you're saying it's about the social good. It's not about necessarily just the business. The social good is the motivation. It's not just a buy. It's not just, a by consequence, right? Yeah, and personally I see a lot of young students right now that you are really interested, as you say, in that intersection But we were kind of on the early edge of that and in fact we had our own conference we created called the Zero Trade-Off Investment Conference. And we look at things that could actually create a great financial return and a great social return. Right. But clean energy was one of those. And we got involved in a company called Opower that was really about using social psychology to get people to reduce their energy use. And that ended up being a huge success. And again, showed me what's possible. Inner city, we've had a focus on inner city and ethnic entrepreneurs. So, I'm still on the board of a company that's now called UR Welcome. UR Welcome, with U and a R. And it's kind of like USAA for immigrants. And then we had inner city something called the Villa, which was an inner city shoe store really got ... parents' sneaker store and started opening up the inner city and building work skills and life skills. And so a number of those things. And then Full Circle Fund, I realized so many of my friends from business school and law school that did have a really deep interest in doing good in the world, but they were busy. Everyone's you know, you're busy with your lives, your work, your kids. And so, we said, "Let's pool together our time and our money." And that was Full Circle Fund and we started that actually this is almost exactly 20 years ago. This our 20th anniversary year. Wow. And it's just that way I found, like you see some books behind me, I find when I'm part of a book club, I read more books. So, when I'm part of something like Full Circle, I ended up giving more because you build a social community around giving. And it's also, it's available. So I mean, right now, a lot of this idea of you wanna get something done I love behavioral economics and when you talk about the social psychology of reducing energy. So Dan Ariely is a big mentor of mine. And one of the things that I was always inspired by him was he says, Listen, we're irrational people. It's really hard to change ourselves, but if we can change our environment to fit what we want to achieve, like joining a book club and then you're systematically forced to read a book. Or joining the Full Circle Fund and now you have the accessibility to go and help others. I think that's marvelous. Josh, tell me a little bit about this innovation in government because I wanna make sure we leave enough time for this because I think it's fascinating. You're running for Senate. How do you do this transition from entrepreneur investor to government? What motivates you to do that? Sure. I proabably have Dan Ariely's book right behind me. Wonderful. Yeah. I think you look and see where you can have the biggest impact. And when I started really focusing on the state of California and realizing we have a two hundred billion dollar budget If it were our own country, we'd be the fifth or sixth largest economy in the world. And there's really not that many state senators. There's 40 state senators. And probably five to 10 of those 40 who are really probably the most influential. And then saw, began to see that as an opportunity for change. Essentially this is the board of directors for the state of California, the United States Senate, and the state House. And the more I started to focus on that ... this is a real opportunity. And listen, I'm sure and I ... friends up there now, and it is still 40 in the Senate, 80 in the House, so it's still 120 people still, I'm sure it's ... bureaucratic at times. But when you look at the opportunity for leverage, I think it's tremendous. And whether it's meeting our clean energy goals. We're, California, I think it's the hope, certainly for the US and one of the big hopes for the world. And by the way I'm really excited about collaboration, as I've done in my past life about collaborating with Israel and the amazing technology around water. Totally. And around solar, around storage that's coming out of Israel. I'm really looking forward to collaborating there. So, whether it's clean energy, whether it was focusing on social justice and criminal justice reform, that California was this huge leverage point. And I got really excited about that. And that's what I'm going up there to do. That's incredible. So and is this like a spontaneous gut feeling that you have to do this? Or is this something that you feel like you've worked towards for years? Which of these two? It's a little bit of both to be honest. I mean, like I said, I started out in DC before I came out to Stanford and business school, law school. I was already focused on policy. So it's not like a brand new, like I woke up one day and decided I had to do it. So I'd say it was more of an evolution in terms of really I never thought I would personally run. That's something I never thought for sure would ever happen. So, but I was always very interested in policy maybe more so than other kids or other young adults. So I'd say it's a bit of an evolution. Right. And I mean, you're gonna come there. I don't know how many people that are Senators have a background, this entrepreneurial and innovative background that you have. Do you think that's gonna be a challenge? Or is that going to be a fun experience being sort of the odd one out? I think it'll be a little bit of both. I'm sure it'll be some eye opening situations. So I think it'll be a little bit of both, but I am really excited about it. And hopefully people will turn to me on certain issues and look at me whether I've got some degree of expertise to bring. But at the same time, I need to be humble as well and realize there's a lot I have to learn about the state of California, I'm already starting now, but it's such a massive state with its agricultural economy, the Hollywood economy, the tech economy. There's just so much to learn. Like I said, I just got back from this trip all the way down the eastern Sierras all the way to Death Valley. It's a really incredibly diverse state so I've got a lot to learn as well. I think it's unbelievable. But the perception of young entrepreneurs like myself when we think of government, senator, congressmen, we look back at these funny videos with Zuckerberg sitting in front of Congress and they're asking him, "Well, so how do ads work? Are you tracking people and are you showing them stuff that they should buy?" And so our perception, somebody who sits in the government is not necessarily the most tech savvy, not necessarily the best representative of where innovation takes it. You're bringing a different perspective to this. So, how do you see this mishmash of both bureaucracy and innovation and tech and crises that are happening? I mean, you really have to balance everything. Yeah, I think when you look quick changing government, and I've also done it in law by the way I started a whole company. I spent 10 years in legal analytics. We brought data and analytics to the law. Which was a long, so that was the long game - What does that mean bringing data analytics to the law? Yeah. In politics sometimes gotta play the long game, too. And thinking driving across the state. I've been on the board of UC Merced for 15 years. That was a government decision that said "Hey we need to start a new UC campus in the Central Valley" And first it was a 100 students and now it'll be 10,000 students. And my friend Jack's now at Google X and so we had a a call now that Google is getting serious about diversifying the STEM pipeline. And we've got all these great diverse engineering students coming out of UC Merced. And so, sometimes you got to, but it took a long, it didn't happen overnight. But it was, people were very forward thinking to say, "Hey great. We need a new UC. Let's put it in the Central Valley. Let's encourage college attendance" And so, sometimes you gotta play the long game in government. Jack is actually a very good friend of my father's and every time I meet him, my mind is just blown. The work they're doing there on quantum computing is just phenomenal. So, bringing analytics and data to legal. What does that mean? What did you try to do there? Sure. Basically in a nutshell, we realized it started really around patent, some area that a lot of entrepreneurs get very frustrated with the patent system. And we realized there's just no data. There's no data about when you get hit with a patent lawsuit, who is this person that sued me? What's their pattern of behavior? Are they looking for a quick buck or is this a serious company that takes things all the way? And they've got a serious claim here. There's really, there was no data. No data about judges. Who's this judge I'm in front of? What is their, what is her pattern of behavior? And so we realized this endemic in law. There's just no data. And so we said that data is actually out there it's just buried in millions of lawsuits. So, we said, "Hey, we can extract out the millions of data points from millions of cases" Then we could tell you if you're in front of certain judge. We can say, "Hey, in the last thousand cases of this type in front of this judge, here's the lawyers that have the most experience through the years who've won the most motions. Here's a strategy you might think about pursuing. And here's how this judge has ruled on these kinds of cases" I mean, I think I kind of blindly assumed that this is how a lot of these law firms work today. That when they're advising on a case, that they're able to look back at thousands of other similar cases because history repeats itself constantly and be able to give those insights. You're saying that that's not really the case? Well, I know a lot of brilliant lawyers, but you can't keep 3000 cases in your head. I mean, it's been the ultimate anecdata business, right? It's like, "Oh, yeah, I had this case in front of this judge. And I remember this" I love that, anecdata. I've never heard that before. I'm gonna start using that. ... anecdotes it's anecdata. And that's really what it's been. It's all reputation based too. "Oh, this law firm's got a great reputation" "I need a great lawyer. Oh you gotta talk to Lisa" But really, there's just no data behind it. I mean, it's like VC too, frankly. You always put your wins. If you go to any VC website, they're gonna say, "Oh, look at all our great exits." They don't say, "Oh, here's the other 100 companies we invested in that didn't make it" Right? - 100% I mean, now with Now people have gotten a little more data there, but that was also a data void. Interesting. And so when was this that you started this firm? So, this is actually it was a public interest project at Stanford Law. And what was amazing, you probably know Andrew Ng. Of course. Google day So, Andrew, when he was still full time at Stanford and then Chris Manning, who runs Natural Language Processing. Yeah. The founders of this public interest project went to Andrew and Chris and said, "Will you help us?" And they first said No 'cause they're very busy. And then ultimately they said, "Hey, this is good for the country." And they got involved and they got excited about, specially Chris, you know natural language processing. So, I was very fortunate, this was way before I was involved. This back in 2006, 2007. And then it spun off as a public interest project in late 2010. They brought me in 2011 to grow it. So, but it still took nine years. Now, it's part of LexisNexis and it's growing. We just passed three million cases that are now in the system. We just added a whole new area of law. We're starting to add states now because so much of what happens is at the state level, and that's even much much harder place to even get the raw materials 'cause most states don't even have electronic court records. So, anyway it's been the long game, the long journey but it's really transforming the way law is practice. So, you worked on projects with Jack Hidary. This project was had involvement with Andrew Ng and Chris. I mean, these are just the top of the top of the top of the world thinkers. So I think that's just incredible. What are you most excited about moving forward? And actually right before that, the election, how does it even work? What do you have to do? Because a lot of the times when people in tech, they're thinking of politicians and the elections, it almost seems like, "Oh yeah, he asked to go do that. He has to go talk. He can't just do" Talk to me a little bit about this election process. Sure. One thing I'll just say, because a lot of people who are entrepreneurs come in, they think they can just waltz in to the political system, and it doesn't work that way. You really have to become part of the ecosystem. You have to really get to know all the players. And Woody Allen used to say "98% of life is just showing up" You really have to show up at all the local Democratic clubs and all the local meetings and really get to know people. You cannot just waltz in and say, "Hey, I'm gonna run for this thing." It's just it's a very different The world's even here in Silicon valley are just not connected. People, in fact it can also be a negative in some ways. So you really, so I really put in many years of hard work and fund work. But hard work at the local level and just getting to know people and spent 18 months before the primary just on this race alone. So, 'cause we have twenty four cities in my district and it spans all of Silicon Valley from South San Francisco down to Sunnyvale. And each one has city council members, each has school board members, there's county officials and they're doing hard work for many years. And you got to understand that. So, you really have to put in the time and I'm proud that I did that. Finished first in the primary. We have in California a great system, a top two system. So, basically the top two vote getters advance. And what that means is, usually, you actually have two Democrats in this area so people then get to choose between a flavor of Democrat. Or in Orange County you might have two Republicans. Actually, in my race, I did very well and there was a lot of other Democrats. So it ended up being me and a Republican that we'll be facing off in November. So we have the top two primaries - For the whole state? What'd you say? That's gonna be for the whole state? No. This is our district. So, each state senate district is about a million people. So, our district is from everything, basically everything from the border of San Francisco down to Sunnyvale. Okay. So, I get the Israeli Kibbutz in Sunnyvale as part of my - 100%. I had a talk with the mayor of Sunnyvale back then, Larry, about back in, what was it? I think two, three months ago. And then halfway through the talk, he mentioned that he's also a program manager at a startup, at a battery startup. And I thought it was just, it was hilarious that I'm talking to a mayor of a city. In Israel, you never have that. So I think it was just phenomenal. And what are you most excited about the next few years, potentially serving as a senator? Yeah. I'm very excited about the opportunity to make change in areas that we've  talked about. Clean energy. Got to lead the world. Criminal justice reform. Education. Higher education. We need three more UC Merceds in this state. More access for kids. Those are just a few of the areas, but I'm really excited about the opportunity to lead in all those. Build a world class transportation system here, especially in the Bay Area. I just got off a call on that. So, those are some things I'm really passionate about. And now looking at this crisis that we're facing globally and you're at the intersection of both innovation and government, so, you're getting the flavor of both. In your take, where are we headed with this? And what are the things to be either optimistic about or pessimistic about? Well, I think there's reason to be optimistic and we've seen even through this pandemic both how communities have rallied. I mean, certainly in the US we have some divisiveness and polarization right now that we need to get through. But you've also seen there's a lot of great stories about neighbors helping neighbors. And innovation, whether people how they're running their small businesses differently. How cities are opening up streets for restaurants or how, I just got email today. ... looked at a guy, "Hey, I'm leaving Samsung to lead this covid-related company." And was like, "Wow that's really cool." So I mean there's a lot of people doing really cool work and it's gonna and biotech is also an area I spend a lot of time on now especially in oncology. And to see that we will have a vaccine and faster than we've ever had one before. And it's not overnight as these things are. But we're getting there and the innovation piece is critical. 100% Josh, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it. Thank you for doing this right after you're back from your trip. Before we leave, I have to ask you for three words that best describe you. Thank you. I would say innovative, thoughtful. and passionate, Innovative. Thoughtful. Passionate. And I think one of the things that I'm most inspired by and I'm taking a lesson for myself is this persistence and consistency with putting the public interests first. I think it shines on all the different endeavors over the past decades. And the fact that you're able to do these endeavors with the greatest thought leaders in the world. Seriously, I mean, all the people that we've talked about, I mean, they're really just incredible. And I'm very very excited that people are now entering the politics space and government with the insight and the experience of what it takes to bring innovation And thank you very much. I look forward to seeing you up there. Thank you. Thanks for having me. Take care. Bye bye.
