1 Anat Peled, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Thanks for having me. It's great to be here. You're actually calling from Stanford Campus, you're at the Hillel Building. Right? I am. I am. There's lots of pulley books behind me so. Wonderful. And actually, so the reason that you're still in campus is because you're finishing your senior year. You recently finish your Senior Thesis. Your honor's thesis. You actually won an award. What was it? The Kennedy Award? It's an award for the best Jewish studies. Like the best thesis on the Jewish topic. It's called the Donald and Robin Kennedy Undergraduate Award, so. Insane. So, we're gonna have to talk a little bit about what that is. But your journey is so fascinating. And really the reason why I think this is gonna be such a fun conversation is because you and I come from very similar backgrounds. From Israel. Very Israeli we've made a transition to Stanford. For me it was a dream. My whole life, I didn't know what to expect. And I think, it's such a unique transition. While I'm in technology, you're actually more on the humanities. And you're specifically passionate about history. You're a Rhode Scholar. And you're going to study in Oxford next year. Right? Yeah. I am. Unbelievable. Hopefully it's okay with a, you know. It will be on Zoom but, Okay. So Anat, just how many people get the Rhodes scholar a year? Well, Israel it's very new. So, only two people get it from Israel. But yeah, it's very competitive. Very very right. So, whoever doesn’t know, I mean Rhodes scholar, whoever hears that name It is an academia. It's like one of the biggest things you can accomplish. One of the biggest scholarships you can get. So Anat, just tell me a little bit about yourself? Where do you come from? And why are you at Stanford? What are you finishing in Stanford now? Totally. Yeah. So, I'm from Israel. I'm from Ra'anana. Yeah. I mean, yes, I grow up speaking Heblish, so Hebrew and English. So, I'm kinda in both of those worlds. Did high school in Israel. Then went to the army. And I've served in Intelligence. in one of my time. And then I worked a little bit in a non-profit where we brought together Muslims and Jews. together through martial arts. So that was a lot of fun. Do you know martial arts yourself? I don't. I was the only one. I was the Project Manager. Of course. Of course. I was the only one there who was not a black belt. Yeah, and after that I applied to Stanford. It was a dream of mine to get this Liberal Arts Education. Which is very different than in Israel. Where you know, you apply years. You know, you study this. And you don’t really get a lot of kind of exploring outside. And so I came to Stanford. Fell in love with history. Yeah, and next year, So, Anat before we jump to history. Because you know, a lot of my friends and colleagues from 8200 and from generally Tel Aviv in Israel, They're watching this and while You and I had a very interesting experience in Stanford. I think that it's very different from the ordinary university approach that Israel has. I don’t know if it's better or worse. But it's different. And I'd love for you to give me, you know, your true sense of what was the Stanford experience from you having gone through four years of it now? Yeah. So, first of all if any Israelis who are watching this and thinking about coming. Totally apply. It's really great. And it's possible. If we did it, it's possible. It is possible. If they were willing to take me on Anybody can get it, I'm telling you. Yeah. So, it's just been amazing. Because you get the opportunities here are really, You think of it, you can make it happen. They have the funds. They have the best professors here. And as for me, I kind of studied history. I love it. But it also, I study it 'cause it didn't get in the way of my education. I could take the best classes, the best teachers from other department. Yeah, I've done a lot of political science. And journalism. And anthropology. Like all kinds of stuff. Was there a specific class or moment that really, you know, that's a key or a Stanford highlight? Or is it a combination of bunch of things? I will tell you about a crazy class that I took. It's such a Stanford thing. So, basically, it was two weeks intensive seminar called, The Face of Battle. It was for people who finish their first year going to their second year. And I get this okay. So, it was about war. And so we studied two battles. We got assigned a character from each side of the battles. So, we studied Gettysburg. And we get assigned a confederate in the union. And on another battle a little big horn, so. So, the American civil war, right? Yeah. The first battles the Civil war? The second one was a little bit later. But, and then basically you plan a speech. As the character. Then you fly to the battlefield. They flew us to you know, to DC in Montana, and you give speeches as the characters. Where the battle happened. So, I give a speech as Robert E. Lee the Confederate General in Gettysburg. Yeah, it was pretty wild. Like John Huston. Yeah. Wow. Okay. So, really summing it up. The idea also what I feel similar to you, I mean, the opportunities are endless. And you get to really explore whatever your passion is. And while Stanford is really well known for its computer science and mathematics Here you are doing history, and saying, "Yeah, I had won one of the most incredible experiences I could have hope for in history." And what was your honors thesis is about? Yeah. So, my honors thesis is about actually, Israel. It's about the Kibbutz. I studied about you know, I look into the period of the 1920s. The first Kibbutz was found, okay, So, for people who don't know what the Kibbutz is? Yes. It's a one of a kind wacky idea Basically, people say it's the most successful form of democratics socialism ever. Ever. Like ever. It still exists today. Not exactly the same form. But basically all property was shared. And it was all decisions were made through communal meeting It was an agricultural settlement. Yeah. And so, I looked at the 1920s when, the first Kibbutz was found in 1910. The kids started to be born in 1920s. And I wanted to see what this kind of fanatical socialist who came from the struggle in Europe. You know from this background of Jewish kind of you know, you're gonna grow up to be a rabbi, the girls are mother. It suddenly came and they were socialist. And you know, with socialism there's this idea that the Bourgeois family, you know the mom, the husband, the children, its property. That’s bourgeois. We're trying to get rid of it. So, what do these people do? And I studied the family in the Kibbutz. And I try to see how they reimagined it. Suddenly the kids where everyone’s children. They raised kids in communal homes. But it was very painful process. So I looked at a lot of meeting minutes. Alef [--] Who is a philosopher. Who actually did a lot on the family. So, it a was a lot of fun for me to rediscover the history of my own country, and-- Did you read a lot of this in Hebrew? The primary sources? Its all in Hebrew. Yeah, I did some archival research in Israel. at Degania Alef. That would be so cool. Yeah. Wow. Okay. But Anat, one of things that you mention to me right before right before we start. And I think it ties very nicely to to this research that you did. You said one of the reasons you think you got the Rhodes scholarship is because you told them, "Listen. I want to be a top bidder." That is sort of a life goal of yours. What does that mean to you? Because when I started this show, I said, my pitch was, "I wanna interview proud leaders from around the world." So, I very much resonate with this ambition to be a tough leader. That was I aspire myself. What does it mean for you? Yeah. I think that idea still matter. Right? We're in this time where it seems like they don't almost. With all the social media. Everything's fast phased. You know, somethings happen and you forget about it the next day. And you [--]. But, I really believe that ideas can change the world and their important. And they have to be accessible. That's the thing, you know. I want to go into academia. But I also, I wanna make my ideas accessible. to journalism, you know, whatever medium it can reach people. And I guess some of my, I think that the people I look up to, for example, one of my heroes is is Hannah Arendt. So, she was this philosopher who is very famous for covering the Eichmann trial. And she basically went with her truth. She settle lot of things that were not easy to hear. And she suffered a lot from that. She kind of went with her truth. And she had intellectual courage. So, i think it's basically just thinking about how we want to live us as a society. And I want to do that through my research. Through my writing. Through politics. So, do you see yourself as a contrarian? as a goal? I mean, are you looking for different areas in which you can say, "Okay. Well actually, something is missing here. And I wanna do research and I might prove that something is different from what other people believe or go against a crowd." Or is it more general. Just research. Yeah. I'm very interested in, I guess the social contracts specifically. How we live together as a society? What's the glue that holds us together? And as an Israeli, I'm interested in you know, the Israeli context. And I looked back to history, to see kind of you know, we were founded on the idea about just society by these crazy teens who came here and everything behind. Not just to survive, right? We talk a lot about existence in Israel. Right? We have the holocaust. We've gone through a lot. But these young people also thought about content of Jewish life in Israel. They thought about what kind of society they want us to live. What is justice. So I think we can gain inspiration from that. So, I'm very interested in, kind of a connection between history and kind of politics and the future. How we can build society better? I wouldn't say I'm a contrarian. I do think I have a critical mind. I try to question a lot of what I hear. Yeah. So, I guess I just like to understand what's going on around me. So, social contract. I automatically I'm thinking about society and the social contracts of today. Versus you know, when my parents grow up or my grandparents who are on the Kibbutz. So, you know today Oh Kibbutz? Yeah. I mean, I love our families. We're on the Kibbutz right. All of our American cousins, live in the Kibbutz in somewhere and, But it sounds like today's social contract is very much guided by technology. And by the different ways in which we perceive social contracts in communities. So, how do you also become a part of that thinking and that thought process as a historian? Because you have to both understand where technology is going and how it's shaping psychologically our communities while looking at the actual communities. Yeah. So, I guess I have two points on that. So, for the first thing I wanna say about social contract is, I'm not sure what a social contract is anymore. I heard someone say, this professor called Cornel West, talking about the protest going right now, Black Lives Matter. While watching he said, "The failure of a social experiment." he thought that the social contract like there was a breakdown. I think we need, there's a lot of room for you know political theorist and historians to think about what holds us together? What connects us? It's not just the individual. But about the point in technology, I totally agree with you. The historian that got me interested in all of this is Yuval Harari. Okay. I don’t know if you read his stuff. Of course. He's an Israeli historian. He wrote this book called Homo Deus. About technology and he kind of showed you don't have to know the needy greedy of technology. You need to have literacy, I think. And that's something that I'm working on. I'm not the best at it. I'm working on it, but you don't need to know the little things. You can critique it as a human. Like, that's part of the role of humanities. We keep talking about the crisis of the humanities. It felt like part of our role is to talk about ethics and to ask questions. And you don't have to understand how to codes to do that. A 100%. And I can spend it the other way around and say, "Well, what worries me is that, I'm a part of the group that is developing this technologies and I consider myself an innovator and that I hope to one day I build something that will influence society and perhaps change the social contract. And hopefully improve it for the better. Yet, unless I study ethics and philosophy, And unless I study history. How can I hope to be able to make a positive impact with my actions, if I don't know what happened before? So, what it feels to me, which is a little bit worrying is that we have two different populations going. We have the technology population that is really focused on the artificial intelligence and prepping these platforms. And then you can have a clear distinction to historians and more humanities people who, and there's not necessarily a healthy communication. Absolutely. Where is this going? 100% agree. This has been a problem way back. People have been thinking about this for a long time. I think you actually see it on, I mean we go to Stanford and we see it on Stanford's campus all the time. There is like, I don't know if you know this, but there's like the name of like, the techies and the fuzzies. The fuzzies are like, I did not know that. Yeah, it's kind like of old, I'm not cool enough yet to be in those clubs. Well, I guess you're a techie. So, you don't need to worry about it. But, you know it's, What's the fuzzies? Fuzzies. Like they're not doing anything really important. it's soft, you know. Yeah, and there's just this disconnect. There's you go to one part of the campus which is the humanities. And one part is, the engineering quad. And you do all the cool stuff there. And there's this feeling that that's where the future is. That's how you gonna change the world. In technology. But we need to bridge those things in a meaningful way. And not just talk about it. And it's hard. It's about rethinking our curriculum, Yeah, and we haven't figured it out yet. But it's definitely, I love being a humanity student on Stanford’s campus because it's so techie. I think about issues, you know like artificial intelligence things like that. Which I wouldn’t think about if I was on the, I think east coast. 100%. So, Anat I mean, you don't just study. You're writing articles for a bunch of different well-known publications and you really are starting to become a proud leader. And writing some pretty interesting stuff. So, where do you see yourself going? For I have the privilege on one hand speaking to a lot of people in their 40s and 50s who've done a lot and have already their world impact. And now I get the chance to speak to somebody ahead of me. If I had to bet on anybody in the world, I would probably bet on you. That you're gonna do some crazy stuff for humanity. So what path do you see yourself now? Going to Oxford. Rhodes scholar. Where do you go from there? Yeah. I mean my goal is to get my PhD. In Oxford. Continuing history. And then I see my future in Israel. That's where my family is. That's what I care about. And I wanted to have one kind of like rooted in Academia studying the past but also, like kind of rooted in writing and politics and teaching. Thinking about the present and the future And teaching the next generation about, you know inspiring them. And I think we need that. We need to, Yeah. I mean I don't know what you think about what is going on. Israeli politics is madness right now. It's crazy. It was madness when you interviewed Larry Diamond and Hillel back then. And it's even more madness right now. Yes it was. Yeah, we did a talk about one of the Israeli elections. One of the three or four. I can't even count anymore. You know you lose track. Yeah. Well I see myself kind of thorough thinking and scholarship and writing. Hopefully, you know. Thinking about the future. And how we can design our society better I love it. Are there specific questions that you see yourself diving deep into research? Or are you keeping at an open mind and really understanding that yeah, things might change a hundred and may decrease by the time that I'm ready to dive into them? Yeah, at the moment I'm thinking of continuing of my under-graduate thesis. I'm really interested by this world of socialist thoughts. And I guess kind of European intellectual history. Just kind of this big ideas. Like Marx and like Nicheli. All these big ideas that really permeated into different movements around the world. And you know what's crazy? It's kind of inspiring for me because going to high school in Israel. We went through citizenship classes. Yeah. It was awful. I didn't know. I mean looking back, I didn't know that my country was founded by a radical socialist. I didn't know that. We learn about their names. Kind of our around, all the street names. David Ben-Gurion, [--] Katznelson. These were leaders who believed in universal values. I'm not talking communist. I'm talking more of a just society. Like Kibbutz idea of living together. So, we have to find inspiration in that. And we have some of the coolest thinkers in kind of labor scientism. So that's what I'm thinking right now. That's just fascinating. Anat, what are you looking ahead now at Oxford. What are you gonna actually study there? So, I'm gonna study Intellectual History. I'm going I think continuing kind of on the history of the Kibbutz. The time the Kibbutz history, not just to kind of Zionist and Israelis studies but also to the world of socialism and revolution. And try to understand how the Kibbutz fits into that. And whether the Jewish experience in Israel-Palestine, I mean, it was Palestina before So, how does that fit into other kind of movements. Fascinating. Well after this call I, now I understand how much I don't know about the origins of where I came from and the Kibbutz and radical. [--] So, I'm gonna need you to send me this honor's thesis which already won all of the awards. So that I can enjoy it myself. Anat, before we go. And it's just so fascinating. Thank you for your time. I'd love to know three words that best describe you and I'm gonna ask you the same question in about 20 years after you've changed the world. So, I'm gonna test you on how consistent you are. Okay. Well, I think the first one is Curious. 'Cause I really want to understand what's going on around me. I think then it's you know, a Thinker. So, all the time I'm thinking. And I think, Passionate. Well, I'm really kind of It's hard for me to do things that I don't enjoy and so, when I get into a project, am just like, I'm consumed by it. I love it. And you know Anat, before we leave, I do have to mention that I get to speak to quite a few Stanford students and Harvard students, and Princeton and students in Israel. It is so rare to talk to somebody who is so passionate about what their studying in. We do know these phenomena especially in the Ivy Leagues in the US that a lot of students are pressured into studying a subject because it's prestigious and it's what's their parents think or what is society is saying in school. A lot of the techies unfortunately. I like that. And I'd love for you maybe just give me a you know one or two sentences about you know, we're coming in from a little bit more mature background. We've done the military. We've command and we've been a part of teams and we saw some of the bigger level of questions that the world is dealing with. So, if there's any undergraduates who are deciding their major, or are thinking of what to do, and they are hearing this. What advice would you give them after having gone through this experience of following your passion? Yeah. I think that you're just gonna do better if you do what you love. Don't be afraid. The world is a mess right now. We need humanities people. We need people to think about what's going on. The social contract is being torn apart all over the world. I think in America, you see a very visually, the riots and the protests. Totally. But don't be afraid of just following what you love. I understand the pressures. And I understand those things. But, I would encourage it. I think the simple thing is you know, just be better. That's the bottom line. You'll love coming it to work, you know. That's beautiful. That's beautiful. Anat, toda raba. Thank you for the time. Thank you for the inspiration. And best of luck with Rhodes scholarship at Oxford. And then hopefully PhD and change the world. We're gonna have to do some pretty frequent check-ins over here. Awesome. Thank you so much for having me. Take care.
