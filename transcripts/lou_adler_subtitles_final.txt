1 All right. Lou Adler, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Hey, happy to be here. Thank you very much, Michael. Really, really happy to have you here. Best-selling author in Amazon, "The Essential Guide to Hiring" and "Hire with Your Head," and really a world expert on what it means to do intelligent hiring and getting hired, and performance-based hiring. Lou, can you tell me a little bit about a little bit about your background and how did you even get sucked into this incredible industry of thinking about hiring? Well that’s actually a good question. It’s really good for engineers too because my background is an engineer, if you look at my background. Okay. - Guides and control systems. Got an MBA in Finance and Accounting, then started working in manufacturing, logistics, cost accounting, budgeting, planning, a host of different things. Aerospace, handheld consumer electronics, and automotive, the whole bit. And the only reason I actually I was running a manufacturing company. It was 40 years ago. Hated the boss. I mean I got pissed off every single, every other week when he came down he and I just argued and I quit every every other week I quit for a year. Wow Finally quit. Decided to become a recruiter. And this is the interesting thing as an engineering person, especially with manufacturing background, I could see the hiring process was just like making parts. I didn’t care if it was automotive parts, a rocket ship 'cause I worked on guidance systems. In terms of the assembly line? It was automotive components It’s just you have to manage yields. You have to understand what’s the product. You have to have a design spec. You have to have a manufacturing process and you have to manage it every step of the way from concept, from even how you procure parts to final inspection inspection in between. Most people in hiring don’t see it that way. My background as a systems engineer made it a little bit easier, particularly in Finance and Accounting, 'cause I said, "Hey, it’s more than just making parts. You have to control the cost. You have to get influence people" So, very unusual background for hiring. And then I was also a recruiter. I’m probably a recruiter 'cause I’m I was in college, I part of a fraternity. I was the recruiting guy. - Of course. - That's all I did. So, it was like I was designed to be a recruiting person. I love it. Lou, why is recruiting hard? Why is hiring and getting hired a puzzle that confuses everybody? Well, it is a puzzle. And it’s a great, great question. The puzzle is because it’s multi-dimensional. It’s not one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three It’s actually five or six dimensions, and just getting one dimension right is hard. On top of that, you got human nature, which is one of the dimensions. People make decisions. Candidates get nervous. Hiring managers don’t know what they’re looking for. HR overwhelms them with cost, and budgets, and compliance issues that don’t help. People think that the best people are just going to apply to a job posting and go through the demeaning process. You got all these variables that impact the decision itself. And now you got all you. All the kids going to school, getting engineering degrees. I know for a fact you’re not going to make the decision alone. You get an offer, you’re going to ask your friends and family, "Hey is this a good job?" - Of course. And if you’re getting paid 5% less, people go, "Oh, you're not taking that stupid job are you Michael? I mean all these stupid reasons that people take dumb decisions. But that’s what happens. Now you get older, you make even dumber decisions. And then you make a bad decision, you suck it up and you kiss ass, and all this stuff happens. And then, if you get married and your wife says you got to make more money. So, you take a stupid job because of more money. You know, all this stuff. That’s why it’s hard. Right. And why do you call these dumb decisions? So, what is it about these decisions that you don’t consider them intelligent or performance-based? Okay. So, let me go back 35 years. This is a true story. There was a guy named John Morgan. I had a job offer for him as a plant manager in electronics manufacturing company. The company at the time was making high-definition displays, at least at that time, and they’re moving into the displays are really becoming unusual. Liquid crystal and other stuff. I thought I had the job closed. It was a good job Probably in today's dollars, 2020 dollars, Probably $150K to $200K. I would have gotten a 30% fee for that. So, good fee for me. He was going to He told me on Monday he was taking the offer. On Wednesday, he called me up and said, "I’m not taking your offer. I got a better offer." And he told me why. He said, "Well, better title, closer to home, more money." I then said, "Well, tell me a little bit about it." And he told me the company, told me the compensation, told me everything about it. I said, "John, you've just made a long-term strategic decision using short-term tactical information. That’s a dumb de - Now I didn’t say to him that it was a dumb decision. I was desperate. That’s what I just came up with. And he said, "What are you talking about? I said, "Everything you said is about what you got on the start date. Start date is a compensation. It was only like 3% to 5% more. It was the title of the job, better than the one he had. The drive was 15 minutes closer. I said, "John, what you do for the next 2 to 3 years will impact the rest of your life. You’re going into an industry their declining" whatever it was, electronic assembly processes that were outdated. I said, "You’re gonna be going into this industry. In 3 to 5 years when you come out, you’ll be no better than you are today. So you just put a lid in your career. On the other hand, if you go to this other job where they're putting state of-the-art displays, they’re going overseas. I know the title’s a little bit less, but you’re putting yourself on a better career trajectory" But how can you and I’m looking at myself - Let me finish the story. Let me finish the story because it's but it’s a good story. He calls me the next day. He says, "I’m taking your offer." Nine months later, he calls me back and said, "Lou, best decision I ever made. Best thing you’ve ever said to me about making a strategic career decision. I’m now been made VP Operations. We’re making three plants in China."" This was when China was expanding. The idea of you have to make career decisions, not day one decisions. So, focus on Decision-making is what you’re gonna be doing in year one and beyond, not what you get on the start date. And all the people who advise you will be focusing on the start date. What's your comp? What’s your title? Is it cool? Is it this and that? That’s the dumb decision, and all your advisers will focus on the dumb decision stuff, not the long-term career decision. And that’s, if I have any message to say, is focus on what you’re gonna be doing and becoming, not what you get on the start date. I think that’s incredible. I was just taking a fascinating class at the Stanford Business School with Professor Demarest. He was the Head of Communications for George Bush Sr. during his presidency. And the whole class was about how strategy equals context and how you, when you're approaching a decision and you have the facts on the sheet of paper, it seems like an easy decision, but you’re missing the most important factor which is the context of the decision. And what you’re describing is exactly the same thing. The context is the career. It’s not this moment of time and how much you’re gonna get today. Well, let me give you another story 'cause that’s what I do When you're my age, you tell stories. I love stories. Yes. So I have an MBA from UCLA. My first year, I became a financial analyst. I also had an engineering degree. And I was at the corporate headquarters of the 35th largest company in the country. All I was doing was showing the slides. That’s all I was doing. I was in an operations review meeting. The group president was there, chairman of the company, the CFO. Now this is big, and I was nervous as heck. I was like 25. Nervous. So ... nervous. I didn’t even want to say a word. I was even nervous flipping the slides. That’s what they did in those days. I mean I was so nervous being in front of all these powerful people. The CFO of this corporation had a group president, it was probably a $3 billion group, and the CFO of the parent company said to this group president. He said, "Strategy drives tactics. And I don’t care how good the tactics are. Your strategy sucks. Get the f**k out of this room, and come back with a good strategy 'cause you’re wasting everybody’s time." Wow! And this is, I'm sitting here 25 years old and hearing this comment to a group president, and I was just blown away. But it’s driven that was the idea of boy strat - if you have the wrong strategy, it doesn’t matter what you’re doing. You’re gonna waste your time. Now, I go back to hiring. I believe too many people have the wrong talent strategy. They feel they can weed out the weak rather than attract the best. And when you attract the best, you have to nurture them. You have to spend more time with people. They have understand the job requirements. When you weed out the weak, they gotta go through a funnel, and an automated impersonal funnel and endure the inhumanity of applying for a job. And then not being told and all this other stuff. So, it’s the fundamental attract in strategy versus a weed-out-the-weak strategy. So at the corporate level, it’s a strategy problem. At the individual level, making a decision, it’s also a strategy problem. So then, tangibly, looking at my generation and let’s look, for example, at the engineering demographic, people who are coming out of college with an engineering degree and they’re faced with an insurmountable number of opportunities ranging from start-ups to corporates to financial institutions. How do you go about making a decision for yourself? And how And then, I’d like to flip the conversation on how does a hiring manager can look at a 22-year-old candidate and determine whether they will be a good fit for their company with no previous experiences? Well, that’s a great question. And it’s So, I’m gonna give you my biased viewpoint. Of course. My first job as an engineer was in a big corporation. When I got my MBA, I was still at a big corporation. So I learned how big corporations function. I learned how engineers in big corporations function. And my first manager, he was a cool manager, and it was an aerospace company and ... was a systems engineer for a nuclear missile program. And he said, "I don’t want you to do any work" this 22 years old. "I don’t what you to do any work. I want you to answer these two questions." And he said, "Why does E = mc^2 and why can’t you push on a rope?" I said, "Well I don’t need to go to the meeting, but I know the answer to both of those questions." He said, "No, you don’t know the answer. That’s why you have to I want you to meet everybody in the company and I’ll take you out to lunch on Thursday. And we’ll discuss your answers on Thursday." So, this was four days. All he said, "All I want you to do is talk to everybody and get the answers to those two questions." Wow Well the idea that I got was that, at a big company, you have to have a good manager. So if you don’t have a good manager, it’s kind of you’re getting lost. So, I always had good managers help and mentor. So they helped you. But the idea was the technology for engineer, ... that's important. But you can’t convince other people by proving a technology. You have to influence them using different set of skills. I don’t want to call them soft skills and non-technical skills. How do you convince somebody who has a point of view that’s not the same as what your point of view is? That skill, and that’s what I learned. I mean, I didn’t learn it. I understood it by the fourth day on the job, 'cause he made me meet everybody. It was 35 engineers. Wow So, it was kind of interesting. Now let me kind of say that story again because this is as important of making a choice. I took this job. I was going to engineering school upstate New York. I took the job in Southern California because on March of 1968 when I got my engineering degree upstate New York, it was snowing. I get a call from a company in Southern California. It was Vietnam. He said, "Lou, we’d like to make you an offer. No interview. I’d like to make you an offer." I was a pretty good engineer. I said, "What’s the weather?" That was the first question. "What’s the weather?" "72 degrees." I said, "Well ...?" He said, "Absolutely. You’re going to work on a nuclear guidance program for a Minuteman missile." I said, "Will I get any relocation?" He said, "Yes." And I had no money. "How much?" "$0.15 or $0.18 a mile." I said, "When do I get that money?" He said, "The day after you start." I said, "I’ll take that offer." I mean, this was not real rocket science offer, but this was interesting. When I got there, and these were brilliant people working on how to place a nuclear missile using 1968 technology within 100 yards of downtown, the enemy, Moscow in this case. Sorry for anybody in Russia but that's what the plan was. And they could do it. The guys hated the job. Hated the job. I thought it was pretty cool. 22, it was pretty cool. I said, "Why" and as I got to know them over the course of a year, they had all worked on the lunar landing project. All of them. And they said, "We went five years, 24/7 doing, exactly the same work." But because the mission was important, they went all out. Wow So, the work itself is important. The team you’re working with is important, but the mission is just as important. If you’re doing something that’s important, not just for you but for something else, you just get totally motivated. It’s not work. It’s just an exciting venture. That job was not an exciting venture for me. I’ve had others that were. But if you can get the mission right, boy, you’re in the game. So, I don’t know if that’s an answer to your question but it's the stories I tell. - No, a hundred percent. And now, looking over the years as you’re becoming more and more of an expert of hiring and you’re seeing all these different case studies and you’re part of these case studies, do you observe any different trends in the young demographic on how we make how we make decisions on which companies we join or what career paths we take? Are there shifts through generations? Yeah, I think there definitely are. And this is the problem. I don’t think human nature I talk to guys not necessarily your age, but certainly young people, frequently, mid ... people, and older people. I have not seen a change in human nature as a result of all that’s going on here. Smart people are smart people, they were smart people 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago. So, that has not changed. What happened is the corporate world has changed a little bit. I think So, if I had to make advice, I’d say if you could get to a place one to two, three years where you're really put on some kind of a rotation program and really put in different series, that’s invaluable that just takes your education to another level. 'cause now you’ve seen how all these different functions work and how you learn how you can't push on a rope and understanding that. And I call them the non-technical skills. There’s an article I wrote on LinkedIn. It says, "The best technical skills in the world are a waste of time if you don’t have a non-technical capability." And I basically say that people get hired for their technical skills, but they get fired for their lack or they don’t get promoted for their lack of ability to work with people, managing projects, keeping budgets, making commitments. And if you can’t put both of them together, it’s gonna you’re gonna be disappointed and wonder, "Why? Why am I not getting ahead? Why is this not happening?" It’s the soft skills I hate to call the word soft because they're too important. I'll call them non-technical skills. But it’s that combination of both of them. If you get an opportunity to do both of them, you’re in the game. If you don't get an opportunity And I think a start-up could be interesting, but you don’t get the foundation of how to grow a company. And that’s why I would be real concerned about a start-up, a pure start-up. I just 'cause the executives don’t know how to run a company and you’re gonna be in there not knowing how to run a company. And you’re gonna have a It might be an interesting experience and a rocket ship ride, but you’re not gonna get the foundation you need So I would say - So you mean you're worried about somebody who has no experience in the sort of the real, real world or the corporate world running into running a start-up and being an executive of day one and being a leader of day one, not having experienced some of these ropes themselves. But Lou. I also want to transfer the conversation also to, hopefully one day, sooner rather than later when I have my own venture, and I will hire people, and I will need to know what people do I hire, and I will have to make some decisions. What are the key things that I should keep in mind in performance-based hiring as you’ve written in your books? Okay. So, here’s the I happened a conversation this morning with a head of research for a major search firm, one of the top three search firms in the world. And we're talking about diversity hiring. How do really get hire diverse talent? And I said, basically, it’s at the job description level. And I when I ... back to my first search assignment, which was 42 years ago. I knew the president of a company. The company was making automotive components and no job description, no list of, He did have a rough - Hey I need someone with probably 10 years experience and a degree of this and this kind of background. I said, "You know, Mike, that’s not a job description." That’s a person description. A job doesn’t have experience. A job doesn’t have skills. A person has that. Let’s put the job description in the parking lot. What does the person need to do to be successful?" I asked that question. He said, "We got to turn around the plant." I said, "Fine, let's walk through the plant." Spent an hour walking through the plant. Labor problems, logistics problems, warehousing problems, manufacturing process problems, lack of control, no quality control. I mean, it was just a terrible plant. I'm looking at material all over the plant floor. I said, "This is a terrible plant. We’ll get someone to fix it." That was my first placement. I have never used a job description listing skills and experience since then. I always ask the hiring manager, "What does the person need to do to be successful." Five or six performance objectives. Build a team of accountants to launch a new product. Work with marketing and product management to develop a new system that does A, B and C. Put together a product roadmap for the next three years based on industry trends. It’s stuff that people need to do. So, if you don’t know that, how can you possibly assess a person? When I interview candidates, I say, "Hey, one of the big things we have to do is put a product roadmap together that looks at this series of economic considerations. Have you ever done something like that? Walk me through it." So, what I do is I define the job as a series of performance objectives, and I ask candidates to tell me about work they’ve done that’s most similar. And I look at the people who’ve done the most comparable work. It doesn’t have to be identical, just comparable in decision-making complexity, design, team, collaborative skills. So, and then I’m in the game. That opens a pool to everybody. And I tell job candidates the same thing. And is it still as relevant today when especially engineers joining young companies. The roles, while they may be defined in the beginning, they change very critically and sporadically over time. So, is that method of hiring for a specific performance type, is that still relevant to the very new - Of course, yeah. Absolutely. I ... people, ... said "Michael, tell me about your biggest project you had at this company. How did that change over time? How did you deal with that change? What was the biggest problem you faced? What was the biggest gap you had to fill? Walk me through those things" So I’m looking for the ability to not only do the work, but also to handle bigger projects. I want to understand how you did it. So, absolutely. You just got to understand the environment. On the other hand, and the pace, and I look at company culture, the biggest proxy’s the rate of change. I mean, if you’ve never been through a rapid change Like when I was in aerospace, it was like pushing on the ... nothing would change. I’ve been at fast paced companies. I was at the first handheld calculator company. That was every day we changed. It was more fun and that one had to be my best real-time job was working as in the first handheld calculator. I might even have one here. Just to give you guys a sense of what a handheld calculator was in 1972. 8K chip. 8K chip. All it could do was multiply, add, and subtract. Couldn’t divide because it didn’t know how to round off. - Oh, my god. - We could not divide. We got to 16K. It could divide, but it couldn’t round off. Had to get the 32 I mean it was pretty bad. But it was fun. I was in a chip factory looking at and ... them and it was fun. But it was weird. Different world but same problems. Lou, just fascinating. Thank you again for taking the time to do this. I really appreciate it. Before we leave, I have to ask you for three words that you would use to describe yourself. Well, you actually asked me that at the beginning of this and I wasn't supposed to say but I’m actually a pain in the ass. So, that’s maybe four words. But the point being is don’t accept conventional wisdom. If you’re And that’s why it’s hard because you have so many competing objectives. So, if it’s a candidate You as a candidate, you get into an interview. You just got to ask the manager, "Hey, before we get into my background in general, can you just tell me a couple of things you need to get done in this job? I’d like to give you examples of work that I’ve done that might be most related." So, now you’re talking about some real important stuff. You've just got to push the envelope and not just accept the fact that I guarantee, 99% of the people who interview you don’t know what they’re doing. So you got to take responsibility to be interviewed accurately yourself and make sure that job is the right one for you. And make the decision based on where you’re going, not where you’ve been. Hope that’s helpful. Thanks, Michael. I think that’s extremely relevant to everything that, you know, that my friends and I are going through. And thank you for the advice. Thank you for your time. Lou, have a great, great day and stay safe, and stay healthy. You too. Thanks, guys. Take care. Bye-bye.
