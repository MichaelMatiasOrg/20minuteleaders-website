1 And I really believe that business is done human to human. And it's about bringing humans together. And because the community is people, all you need to do really is listen to the people in the community and understand their needs. Orlie Gruper, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you for having me. It's a pleasure and an honor to have you here. Executive director of EcoMotion. The whole smart mobility space is you know, fascinating. There's so many advancements and there's so many things that are happening that I can't even keep track. And when I think about, you know, where we're headed in the next five or 10 years, I'm incredibly excited. You know, before we even talk about your journey and who you are, tell me a little bit about what is smart mobility and why is it something that is so fascinating to you? Wow. It's my favorite topic. So, smart mobility is anything that is smarter, greener, more efficient, better save more money or also just improve I guess, something that is smarter than before. If you look at mobility until now, mobility used by vehicle, now we're starting to see that metro in Tel Aviv and micro-mobility and bubble, which is Via technologies and all these other things. So, we're right now seeing this whole new revolution that is coming. And basically I look at this revolution kind of like we had the Industrial Revolution, and then we had the telecom revolution. And what I love about the telecom revolution, this is what I compare it with in the mobility world is that when we had the whole telecommunication era that had a lot of investment and a lot of developing of technologies in this field, a lot of money was thrown in. In the end, we haven't seen, like we, we didn't even understand where we're going to. And we didn't understand that we're all end up with a flat screen. Right? It's something that no one thinks still happening and this is like a very given thing to us these days. So, mobility for me is the same thing. There's right now a lot of investment, a lot of improvements. A lot of people are working on it from a lot of different angles. We have no idea what [--], but for sure it's going to be a whole new, exciting era for us. I think that is such an interesting analogy, this flat screen analogy. Now, when I'm thinking back to when I was a kid, you know, we're talking about 2004, 2005. And we're looking at all these advancements with the telecommunications. Nobody really knew that in 2006, Steve Jobs was going to go on stage and show the flat iPhone, the touch screen, and really create a whole revolution in that sense. And I think it's just inspiring to think that we don't really know what this iPhone representation is going to be in the smart mobility space moving forwards. But Orlie, take me back a little bit about to your journey. How do you even get started with smart mobility? What is that trigger and what have been some of your experiences within the space? Well, today, you know, I see that it's farther than I thought in the beginning, because I was always passionate about old fashioned vehicles. I wanted a motorcycle since I can remember. And at the age of 15, and I really wanted one already and I could have it. At the age of 16, I started getting lessons. And my parents let me have a lesson, but they wouldn't mind me first like in the end. So, it turns out I had to found my own company. And I founded an electric motorcycle company. But I guess, professionally, it started in the Army, in the Air Force. I was exposed to the whole aviation world. I was in the room operations of an F-16 squad, and then a commander of course. And I love aviation and everything it brought with it. And how, you know, it's crazy, but we really take for granted the thing that we go into this vehicle, even if it's a car, we sit down and then we come out on the other side after, you know, just resting for a while. And after the army, I was recruited to operate private aviation fleet. So, I continued with this passion. And I did my BA in business majored in IT and then founded the Blitz Motors. I sold my half six years ago. They just IPO-ed last week, which is really exciting. Wow. Congratulations. Yeah, it's amazing. It's electric motorcycles, you know. And every motorcycle that someone, like got off the road, old school petrol with the whole smoke coming out type of motorcycle and putting on a new electric green coagulant. It's like, everyone sold is like it was an amazing, amazing experience for me. And I think that's incredible. Orlie, I have to ask about the founding of the Blitz company with electric motorcycles. It has to be a little bit different than starting another software company or you know, the typical startup that you see today that is mainly software focused with either BTC or B2B. You're here selling literally vehicles that have to be certified to go on the street. They have to be saved. They have to provide some good experience to their users. Tell me a little bit about this founding of the company and some of the interesting challenges that you had along the way. Wow. So many challenges. Well, I guess it started really by understanding what is needed and what exists, right? Because when you're doing a startup, it doesn't matter what you do. It's okay if you start searching and you see that other things exist, which are the same, we're all on the same market. It's okay. It means, there is a market. But you need to see how you do it better and how offer something that they don't offer, right? Right. So, in motorcycles, I mean it was, I saw that there's a very high power but super expensive one and not expensive ones, but not at all meeting the requirements of the Israeli rider, right? They want to be on the road, they're into power. And then I went out looking for one and we couldn't really find one. So, we found different manufacturers that created different parts and found an assembler that assembled everything under our brand and created this vehicle, two-wheel vehicle that was at the same price of petrol vehicles on the market. But still, you were saving from day one and you're high powered. So, we gave people what they wanted. And regarding challenges, so many. Wow. One time we meet, you know, a manufacturer that will do it, that will get on this adventure second to get the Israeli government on board with this Ministry of Transportation and then the Israeli Standard Institute, and there's just that is a whole, is a whole challenge. We have a lot to go through with easing bureaucracy and then it was creating a showroom in Tel Aviv, and creating a whole garages network all over Israel so they could maintain the vehicle and then, you know, creating a clientele and maintaining. The thing I loved about the clients is that they created their own bike club. Like the electric motorcycle bikers club. And really moving, yeah. It really shows how people were connected to our products. I love that. Orlie, I think this is a perfect segue to the whole community scene. Because your product, your electric motorcycles created, created some grassroots communities that started as a result of people buying into your product, the mission and the experience. But then you went and you intentionally helped run and are still running, i think the biggest smart mobility community. I think over 600 startups are involved with community, am I right? Yeah. Over 600 start ups and 12,000 community members. Because startup can't really grow within a void. We started a community that brings together all the relevant players. So we have industry players, investors, government entities, principalities, academia, all in one. And yeah, it's amazing. EcoMotion started in 2012. I used to be an entrepreneur. As part of the community, I started meetups, we're like 15 people. And the guy they brought to talk was talking about innovative design more in 2012. We weren't really talking about the whole digitalization yet, but understanding that that's the future and how Israel in this digitalization of mobility, we talked about smarter mobility before so, digitalization is a huge part of that and how Israel now has an advantage to do that. And this community is amazing. It's moving, actually. Everyone is so engaged in creating this better future and really good people. So, it's a great job. I love that. Orlie, tell me a little bit about building a community and running a community. First in general, the different challenges and the things to keep in mind when building a community, but then specifically smart mobility. And in a growing industry that is often perhaps, misunderstood about its potential or it's still if you can consider pre-iPhone era, right, in terms of the analogy that we had before. So, what are some of the challenges and exhilarating factors of running a community? So, community is people. That's what you need to understand. And I really believe that business is done human to human, and it's about bringing humans together. And because the community is people, all you need to do really is listen to the people in the community and understand their needs. And then with the power of the community and the quantity to deliver those needs. And these needs keeps changing all the time. So, you really needs to be on top of it. We have on our team a community manager, a partnerships manager. We have an implementation manager. And yet when we meet with startups, the whole team meet with them. It's not like one person job because it's really important for me that the whole team can jump up of the trends, the technology and the needs to hear the startup all the time and to try and pick up, you know, in between all these meetings, try and connect the dots. So, when I just started at EcoMotion, for example, I heard a lot of startups saying, okay, now there are so many investors out there in the field of mobility, how do we know who is relevant for us and so, I heard this a lot of times and then I was like, okay, we need to do something. So, ran into the kitchen and started cooking a plan. And we understood in the end that we want to map all the investors out there. And now we have like a digital map where it goes according to the different sectors as we see them. So, you can see really the logos into different categories and you can filter by round. So, you know who's the relevant investor for you. And when you click one you have a whole all the information about this investor and who is the person to contact in the company. So, we don't need to connect and do intros and things like that. The community can meet each other. But it's a lot about getting supporting tools for that and facilitating those interactions. That makes perfect sense. Yeah. Tell me a little bit, though, about investments in smart mobility. Are they the same as in a regular startup? Is the due diligence process is a little different? What is the thinking process when you go and evaluate a company that is perhaps doing something that the market is not yet accustomed to, there maybe not even governmental support or infrastructure yet, but you're building a technology that could potentially have a positive impact? Well, I think most governments of the world are now, you're probably talking about autonomy. So, I think most governments in the world are now on board with this in trying to understand how they create regulation that is supportive and not restraining. Because it is really hard to make up rules today for something that, you know, you only know the impact in deployments in a few years. So, regarding investments, I think it's like many other fields. The first thing in investments is the team. So, that's a really important one. It doesn't matter what field you are. The team is the first thing people look at when they put money. They put more money on the human than they do on the technology. Because in the end, the technology will be made by humans creating it. So, an investor wants to know that the entrepreneurs will be able to stand back up once they fall, will be able to find solutions when they're put on a brick wall because they will, many times. And they're frustrating in the domain. But that's, I think, the main focus. And there's many different types of mobility when we look at it. So, you have the whole autonomous and connected world. And in this, like last year or so, there's a lot of talk about level four and five being pushed back. But level two, three here and now, and there is so much technology is needed already for these levels. So, it shouldn't frighten anyone wanting to go into this field because there is so much more to be created for that. And that's the near future. And also, I've seen really high A and seed round investment. So, a lot of companies can really run for a while. And the other things are like mobility services. So, it can be an app like Moovit. Yeah. This is our mobility today. And it could be kick scooter shared platform. Like we need to remember Bird and Lime and all of those were non-existent like five years ago. Right? It's like a whole new thing. It's mind boggling And it's awesome too because we don't see our life without it now. And think how much there is more to create on that and how much there is more to optimize. And the mobility in different countries is not at all the same. Like Israel doesn't have the great public transportation where other countries do. And there's advantages and opportunities in each one of those. Right. Orlie, tell me a little bit about the future of smart mobility from your take and from observing the work of hundreds of startups. What are some of the most exciting advancements tangibly that we can expect to see in our streets, on our phones, satellites, whatever it may be? How is our consumer behavior expected to change realistically over the next five or 10 years? Wow. Five or 10 years, okay. You're narrowing down to more like the now. Right. What we are feeling the five to 10 years in the shorter version, shorter term is, and I'm speaking this is too hard for me because you know it's, a lot have happened in the past 10 years. But in this five to 10 years, I think everything will become more seamless. We're still buying tickets for stuff that's not going to happen anymore. You're just going to use things and will be added to your bill kind of thing . Where if you hop on a kickscooter and then you get on a train and you come off and then you get on a bus then, all of that ride will just be billed to you. You don't have to deal with, with too much payments. In terms of logistics, I feel, these five to 10 years, from what we experience in this whole corona era is like, e-commerce, yeah, like craziness. And this affects also logistics. And I feel like logistics is going to improve tremendously. We're looking at instead of big trucks, like picking things off the ship and taking that into the city, it's going to break down into smaller, smaller packages and more urban like logistics, something that is more compatible with the city. 100%. In whole, I feel this city is, and most cities are making more walkways and more bike lanes. And Amsterdam was there long ago before us. But it really shows right now that we're going back to this era or forward to this era. Regarding the autonomy, then I think in time years it'll be weird to drive a whole way from our house to the end destination. I can't say, you know, what level will be at and all of that. I always say I'm not a prophet, but I'm sure it will be weird. You know what I mean? I love that. I love that distinction, by the way, Orlie. Because you're not just saying that, you know, it'll be common. The fact that you're saying that it'll be weird to drive the whole way it implies that it's not just that the people who ride the wave are going to be the first consumers that are going to jump into, you know, like we have with Tesla's. But you're saying that our consumer behavior is going to already shift in such a way that it'll be odd to not have some sort of autonomy along your driving route. Perhaps, some people will have full autonomy. But the average person, it will be weird if they don't. Orlie, unfortunately, you know, 20 minutes go by so quickly. But I really want to thank you for your time and for your generosity. It goes by quick, right? But I'd love to ask you for the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. And I really wanted to talk about gardening, but we just didn't have time. So, we'll keep that for the next episode. Yeah. Three words I use to describe myself. Well, I guess I'm a child of light, love and creation. That's like the three words that guide me in life. This is what I feel is the true meaning to everything. Wonderful. And what motivates me. Wonderful. That sounds great. Orlie, thank you very, very much. This is a fantastic thing of inspiration. And stay safe and stay healthy. I can't wait to share this to the world. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. Chow chow.
