Alon Halevy, thank you so much for being on my show. How are you? I'm doing great. How are you? How have you been during this crazy time? You know, it's been a difficult and very challenging time, but I'm trying to make the most of it. So, I've learned how to cook out of sheer need. And my cooking skills have just skyrocketed to a point where you can actually eat my food. I've done gardening. I've been exercising. So if you look, I'm actually, mentally in a pretty good shape. That's pretty fantastic. I think it's always fascinating for me to see how every person interacts differently, and I was just talking about it with a family recently about how it's crazy how we all have this collective crisis and every person now manages it differently. But Alon, one thing that is different from your daily life is that you are a big traveler and you actually traveled to 30 different countries writing a book about coffee. Now for context, you're also a director within Facebook AI, yet you go and you are writing a book about coffee. What is that all about? Well so, good question. So the book was actually written when I was working for Google. Okay. Google gets the credit for the book Google gets the credit. And I think, I have no good explanation for why I decided at some point in my 40s that I need to write a book about coffee. I always like to go to cafes. I always like the vibe in cafes. And I always noticed that in different countries you go, you get different experiences in cafes and so I was very curious about trying to map that and study it at a little more detail why am I getting these different experiences. And then I did something which ultimately led to writing a book. I started telling my friends that I think I should write a book about coffee, and after a few months, my friends had started coming back to me and say, "Hey, where's the book?" And once you sign a social contract, you have no choice but to do it. Alon, I love that so much. I created a Google map and I listed through 30 different countries that one must visit in order to write a book about coffee. Many of them I was traveling to or to the area anyway because of the nature of my job. Right. Some of them I actually had to take a few days off. That's hilarious. Alon, how many cups do you drink a day? Just for context. Only two but they're very high quality. Only two? Only two. If I'm at a coffee conference, which A, these things exist and B - A coffee conference? - Yes There must be one hell of an energy in that auditorium. Yes. So then I would drink somewhere between 10 and 15 espressos or something. Okay and before we move on to technology and high tech, what is your favorite coffee you've ever tried in your life? The country and place. The favorite is from a region called the Yirgacheffe in Ethiopia. It came from a one of the cooperatives there. It just blew my mind. That's the thing. Great coffee will just blow your mind. One of the hardest transitions I've had coming from Tel Aviv to Palo Alto, I have to admit, is getting used to not having my afuch in the morning and my cappuccino. So that was definitely a big change. But Alon, we only have 15 minutes left. I have wasted way too much about coffee. Take me through your journey. You start out as an entrepreneur. Move on to researcher. Go through these incredible companies like Google, now Facebook, Bell Labs. Why are you so curious about your domain expertise? You were also a professor at University of Washington. Walk me through your journey a little bit. Okay. So I had no doubt in life that I needed to be a professor. Really? My father was a professor. It looked like the right job to do. So I never actually had a point in my life where I had a hard decision to make. Interesting. So it was obvious that I wanted to do a PhD. At Stanford, of course. I came to Stanford, of course. And then, after I finished my PhD, nobody gave me a professor job. So I went to, what was at the time, a pretty prestigious lab called AT&T Bell Labs. And a few years later, I got an offer to be a professor at the University of Washington. Wow. Then I realized, but this is within the height of the 90s when all these startups were going on. Is this where you actually met my father? Back in Bell Labs? In Bell Labs, yes. Okay. Okay. Now I'm making the connection. Yeah. Yeah. Your father and I were both part of the database community, the academic database. So I've known him since I graduated, maybe even before. Wonderful. So, first of all, did the professorship live up to your expectations? Why did you want to be a professor? I mean, yeah your father was a professor, but what attracted you to academia so much as you're seeing the dot-com rise, and obviously with the bubble, but everything rise? I think at my very core, I like to think about new ideas, break new ground, and ask the questions that will lead other researchers and engineers and companies to think about the next generation of products. So to do that, being a professor is a good place to do that. I really enjoy working with students. I had some pretty awesome students at the University of Washington. And I'd still recommended it. I mean, being a professor is you can do much worth. But I also had a entrepreneurial bone in my body. Yeah. So take me through your two companies. The second one was acquired by Google, I believe. Right? That's when you joined Google? Yes. So, the second company was based on a project that we did at the University of Washington. We developed some technology that enabled search engines to actually crawl beyond forms on web pages. So if you saw a form, until then you needed a human to actually fill in the fields of the form and to get all the content. We developed a method that was able to do that automatically, and therefore add many more high quality pages to the Google index at the time. And we're actually still looking back at 2005, 2006. Right? These are around the time. So, it's still very early. And very few people talked about web development and websites just became a thing. That is true. That is true. It's now that I think back at it, that's a good point. We still didn't understand, web search were still, even though Google was already a public company when I joined it, web search was still in its infancy. And it was a really, I remember at the time, Google was an extremely exciting place to be at. - I'm sure I'm sure The ideas that people were coming up with were I just had a very fascinating chat with Marcel Kornacker from Apache Impala and he mentioned that he was at Google also around 2003, 2004, working on databases and how exciting it was at the time when it was just people are understanding what's the potential. Alon, give me your two cents quickly about this intersection between academia and startups. You're working on research as a part of academia which naturally flows into the high tech scene. You've formed a company out of your work in University of Washington. Stanford professors are very well known to do this type of thing. Andrew Ng, I believe, runs about 10 or 11 different startups at the same time. So, what is this? Is there a dissonance? Do they want you to do this? Is this frowned upon? So that is something that has, over the years, the universities realize that this is a good thing for them. - Right. So if you go back even 20, 25 years, it was a difficult thing to do. Universities like Stanford and MIT realized early on that being part of that ecosystem is an important thing for the university to be involved in. And then you get a bunch of lawyers in the room, right? And so, it takes a while to work out the process and to make sure that everybody is gets right credit. The university gets a cut, the students that were involved get a cut. Whatever. All these things worked out. And also universities were letting faculty leave for a year or two to work on their company and then come back which is really important because it's very hard to start a successful company and not be full time at the company, especially if you're the founder. So I think today it's very different than what it was when like 15 or 20 years ago. I think today it's sort of taken for granted that people are gonna do this and I think the process is much more well established. But again, it varies by university and country and it's not easy everywhere. All right. Okay. So, I'd like to fast forward to present day. You're a director within the Facebook AI group. And everybody talks about AI and especially now as we're approaching 2020 is a monumental year not just because covid, which is a very data driven pandemic, right. I mean the whole world is trying to figure out what the hell is happening. But also we have elections coming up and you have, data is just playing such a more significant role in our lives more and more. And that's something that I'm very curious about within Stanford. At the level of a director and with your experience in the field and with the responsibilities that you hold, talk to me a little bit about why you're passionate about the field of artificial intelligence and maybe a little bit about our responsibility as we develop responsible and ethical AI. Wonderful topic. I'm totally into that right now. So, the short answer is there's never been a time in history where AI was so crucial to the continuing functional behavior of humanity. Okay? So, let me be very specific. Social networks are awesome, right? They enable anybody to have a voice, right? They enable, whether it's a famous person or your next door neighbor, anybody can say anything. You can start connecting with people in other parts of the world that share common interests that you've never met before. Wonderful social value ... No argument there. Yeah. But, and there's always a but when there's a great technology, right? Social networks also are a window into the worst in humanity whether it is people putting up hate speech, people creating and disseminating misinformation, people exploiting other people for various things that I don't even have to mention. People try and sell illegal items on social networks. So the number, and we call these violations, these are policy violations. But I think the big thing here is that we're talking about scale. So, you can have a thousand people sitting around and reading every post, but when you get to millions or billions of posts a day, at that scale, it becomes a feat, right? Yes. And so this problem is known as the problem of preserving integrity with networks. Okay? And hopefully in a few weeks from now there will be a survey that a bunch colleagues and I at Facebook will have finished writing about this topic that I recommend to - So we're releasing this video after that survey is published so that I can put the link there because I'm sure it'll be fascinating. Sounds good. ... this might take a while because it needs to be released. Oh, we have time. Covid is here to stay for a long time. Don't worry. This show is gonna go on. Okay. Good. So, it is crucial to social networks to keep the content on the network safe for the users, okay? And as you pointed out, doing this manually is impossible. Right. So what we have is, we have a bunch of AI systems that are constantly looking at content coming in. Okay? When these AI systems are extremely confident that this content is violating, they will remove it automatically. When they are not confident, or when they will receive a user flag, so users will see content and say, "Hey, this is a violation" We will send it to a large number of paid workers who will look at it and see whether it violates our policies. By the way, in terms of the ripeness of the technology, and of course if I ever ask something that is not suitable for here let me know. But in terms of ripeness of the technology, where are we at now? Is it more so on the automatic flagging or more so on the on the user flagging? So Facebook actually publishes every six months a report on the numbers that they - Okay. Okay. So actually in some of these, and they are like tens of different violations. First of all I should say, coming up with policies for what is allowed and what is not allowed on a social network That by itself is Yes, and I'm not gonna talk about that because that's gonna get me in this kind of rathole that I am not authorized to go down, okay? But you can imagine, right? This is a really really hard problem. It's based on culture. It's based, there's so many Yeah. It's like the trolley problem. The classic problem. Yeah. Yes. And because fundamentally, what you're trying to do is you're trying to balance between safety of your users and giving people a voice. Yes. Yes. And very small nuances For example, you are not allowed to advertise, to sell guns on Facebook. That's part of the policy. But if you're a gun retailer, you're allowed to talk about what's available in your store. It's those nuances are crazy. But Alon, I do want to save some time also for thinking a little bit broader about the world of AI and where we're headed as a society. So yes, you've got to see both Google and Facebook and while that's your domain expertise now, I want to extrapolate with you a little bit about what are my kids going to experience in terms of their online behavior? Where do you see AI integrating into our online environment as the years develop? Because we'll get over our current humps. We'll get over the elections and covid and everything. I want to know what my kids can expect in terms of their integrations. That's a great question. So, let's put the integrity problem in perspective first, okay? So, 30 years ago, we had a huge problem with spam. Just mail spam. We don't really talk about mail spam anymore, right? It's sort of a ... problem. The hope is that all these integrity violations, all this hate speech and misinformation, it will be the way of the past like spam. It's a much much harder problem in terms of AI and as you point out the subtleties that are involved. But the hope is, that it'll be like spam. - Okay So now the question is, I think of it So to me, integrity is you come onto a social network, if you see something that violates the policies, that's a negative experience for you. Okay? Our goal is to minimize the number of negative experiences that you might have on a social network. Right. Now let's look at the happy side. How can we increase or maximize the number of positive experiences that you have, okay? And that's really where the opportunity lies. Okay? How is it, and I'm speaking here not authorized by Facebook, this is just me. I'm asking Alon Halevy. Of course. How do I make it such that a social network or any AI tool just helps me be my best self at any given point in the day. Okay, so now if I have a couple of hours free and I'm not sure what to do, the computer knows what the weather is. It knows what's open. It knows what I've enjoyed doing in the past. Maybe something what I haven't done for a while. What I want is an AI system that knows me so well, but it's very private right so we're not compromising on privacy. I want an AI system that will give me advice at any given point in the day that will enable me to be the best, to have the best experiences that I can. And by the way, I think privacy is such an interesting issue. And I say that because I'm on the extreme end of I want everyone to know everything about me. I want them to know where I live, what I do, where I work, when I sleep, when I brush my teeth. I want to have the most personalized experience in the world. A lot of my friends, like my age and older, are very conservative like we don't want anybody to know. We're very scared yet we want So we want to enjoy personalization, but not at the expense of privacy. I'm seeing in my friends that are younger than me now at Stanford, because most of them are younger than me, and a lot of the people in Israel, privacy I feel like the generation is like I am like the needle that's about to move into the realm of we want personalization. We understand that in order to get real personalization, we have to compromise a little bit of privacy and we're all for it. So, I'm a big advocate of that. Good. In that case, I would encourage you to talk to your friends and tell them to run for office and be elected to - But responsibly, because it has to be done responsibly, obviously. It needs to be done responsibly. And obviously fairness and biases and data, 'cause at the end of the day, we're susceptible to a variety of biases in our ... as well. And this is a field that we're actively trying to figure out right now. Alon, what are you most passionate about? What excites you most in your professional career? Having technology help people in their day to day lives. Like you're seeing the real impact. Yes. So I want something that actually makes a difference. That either reduces friction for me or makes my life better in some way. So so cool. Alon I wanna - - ... that I like to work on. So but then, at the end, you're working within companies that processes take time, yet when you do get to accomplish something, they roll out to billions of users. So, do you prefer working for a long time to get to that billion user or do you prefer the more startup life where every single day you're making a positive impact on the product, on the team? It's not this or that. I think, even when you're working at a company like Google or Facebook, to get to that billion users, you're still working with a small team and you're still working with people and mentoring people and ... people. Solving hard problems every day, seeing people develop as they mature in their careers. So there's a lot of that going on, and at the same time, publishing papers that have impact on academia. - Right [crosstalk] I think without that mix, I would be not be very happy. And I think that's also a very interesting collaboration between the research part of you, but the product part of you which is not always it doesn't always go hand-in-hand both a proper researcher, a professor in computer science at the same time thinking about the end user and how your products impact humanity at the end. Alon, before we leave, I want to thank you again for your generous time. Really, toda raba. And I have to ask you the most important question which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. Thinks outside the box. Thinks outside the box. It sounds like that's a little bit of what it takes to be a director within Facebook AI. Alon, thank you very much. And stay safe and stay healthy. You, too. I'll see you around J-Ventures. We even forgot to talk about that, but I'll see you around. Okay. Cool. Take care. Bye bye.
