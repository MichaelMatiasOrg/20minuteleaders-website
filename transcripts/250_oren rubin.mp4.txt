1 As a human, for every click of a button that you have in your test which is thousands, you can't remember. Wait a second, I use this property, but I'm going to change it. You can't remember everything. For a computer, that's like. Oren Rubin, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders It's been a while, but I'm so glad that I finally caught you. How are you? Indeed, doing great my friend. How about you? Doing fantastic. You are so kind and gracious to invite me to a wonderful dinner a few months ago. I don't know if you remember, but you brought a great focused group. We talked about testing. We talked about research and development. We talked about the struggles of building beautiful products. And it was very inspiring for me. So, thank you for the invitation for that. You're welcome, my friend. Any chance to see you is great. I love it. Oren, you have a beautiful journey from IBM to WIX to Applitools to now Testim.io. With a lot of things in between that I didn't even mention. But it doesn't do justice to the core of your journey. Tell me a little bit about yourself and how do you even get involved with testing? First of all, you notice that it goes from bigger companies to smaller, like IBM, I was employee 330. At Cadence that was employee number 5000. WIX that was 151. Applitools, I was employee number one. And Testim, that's employee number zero. Yeah. Wow. Okay, so that's a beautiful funnel. And slowly through that funnel, you're getting closer and closer to, to this idea of quality and architecture. Right? I think quality was always there in around me, like, for example, at IBM, things needs to be tested. I love doing that and actually making sure, when you, as an engineer, you want to deliver to people, you want to make sure that it's high quality. Of course, and also helping with the tools. As a young engineer, it's like I love those, actually. So, later with Cadence, I was a compiler engineer. There's a language. There's two languages that were developed in Israel. So, I was glad to be working on one of them. But the nice part is it was a language for hollow verification. So, that means my users, as they say, were people that are testers. So, to understand what they're doing you need to understand a little bit about test automation or in this case, hollow automation. So, I always had this thing in the background, and even then with WIX, of course, I did some side project and that's how WIX got to me and said, hey, we're moving from this spring from flash to HTML, come and help us build this product. And everything was tested manually. And so [--] is a person that came that saw that everything was tested automatically and even had a special special language for that. I was like, "What? No way." Are we going to WIX to run it manually. So, then you start pushing in a company which a company already has a few hundred people, it's like, it's not that simple to make the change. But luckily, the amazing founders and I worked closely with Nadav Abrahami and Yoav Abrahami. Omer on the technical side, [--] that an engineer that turned into the dark side of product and business. But back then, at WIX, I saw the challenge already. And how to change a company and how to make it from only manual testing to be full CICD. What was the most difficult journey of taking a company of a few hundred developers, you know, hundreds of thousands or potentially millions of lines of code and not just slowly transitioning to automatic testing? I know how difficult it is to do it when you have zero lines of code. But how difficult is it to do when you have a lot of lines of code? So, I think in WIX it was a little bit easier because they were just building a new product, so that made it easier. But you need to convince people, actually, that their way of thinking should be different. And you need to find out who are the people that can move something inside the organization. It's always like that. Whether that's in the technical side or not. But you need to understand who are the champions, who are the people that you need to get them excited, one by one, get them excited, and eventually you'll have the majority of people that are rooting for that and will start pushing toward that and will make the change. Okay. So, Oren, I have a challenge for you. Are you ready? I want you to get me excited about testing. You already use testing. Wait a second, are you talking about test automation or Testim.io? Let's start with this idea of why testing is even important. Well, you always test. You don't even know about it, but you always test. The question is when. The question is, who's testing it. Are you testing it or your users? So, bugs are your business and it depends on the company that it hurts you in a different way. And some bugs like Intel had that cost it four billion dollars. And the branding. Right. I remember that. Oh, yeah. And not to mention spaceships that exploded. It's very critical to make sure that you're testing, you're making sure that your product does exactly what you want. So, some companies, very few, like Netflix, can say, wait a second, if if something doesn't work, you'll come back in 30 minutes. But in a lot of cases, think about WIX that someone wants to pay now or PayPal or anyone that wants to pay something for a product that doesn't work, for the next 30 minutes they'll go to the competition. Right. So, you lose money. Okay. So, I'm convinced that testing is important. But you know, when I started my first few days as a software engineer, I was told that before I deploy my product I need to write a bunch of manual tests on JIRA, follow them manually, and that's enough. Then I'll deploy. What's wrong with that? What's wrong with the ideology that I'll just write some manual tests, I'll repeat them every deployment and there's nobody better than my own two eyes, right? So, I think there's a few things that actually happened in the last decade. One is that, we find out that the earlier you find a bug, the cheaper it is to fix it. So, if you find it just before production or a month earlier, then that's a great improvement in ROI. So, that's one thing. The second thing is you actually manually, you can't you can't, you don't have enough people in the world. Let's just say, your people, there's a hundred developers, if you want to run your tests before every pull request, and there's a lot of those. And you need thousands of manual, people manual test that will go and click on stuff. And you can't do that. First of all, if you want to go with a product that was called Shift-Left, you need a lot of tests. And that means paralyzation. And then you get this environment, you want to run different browsers, different parameters. There's not enough humans in the world and that's why we go to machines. So, and they do it much better than us. Much better. And you're going to miss some stuff. And the machine is not going to miss that. Even without coffee. I have to say that one of the first time that I use the snapshot testing, it was still back in the IDF. And I remember that I was developing this website and I've done the manual tests and everything seemed good. And I had just started playing around with taking the snapshots through Jest, I believe, and all of a sudden it showed me that that a part of the website that I didn't even notice started shifting. And I could only imagine how this could roll and this bug would continue and cost me more and more. Oren, but I have to ask, before we get to test to Testim.io, you go through these companies, you do all sorts of different technologies, and at the end you decide that you're passionate about automatic testing and helping organizations around the world to better test and do it in a more fun and scalable way. Why do you focus on that? Why is that the passion at the end? I think that you actually started with the second thing of what you said, which is I wanted to help and say, I love, and so are you we love to help people. But now we need to understand how can I help and what is the best thing that I can do to help people. And of course, to affect as much as more as possible. If you work for one company, you help them if you work at a company. But if you deliver a product that can help thousands of companies, then you get, you feel you can help the large scale of the world. So, it starts with that. The fact that you want to help and the fact that you need to understand what can I do best. And I think, when I'm asked about different questions or talked to, before starting Testim, I talked to so many VP engineers in Israel and the world. And in Israel, it was much easier because everyone is like in a walking distance or nowadays, Zoom distance. But you find out words that what are those challenges, what are their pains, that's the most important thing. And it's weird that a lot of of engineers go to the "dark side" of the business. And they can start a startup. The most important thing they need to remember, someone told me a few years ago, you start a conversation not by explaining what your product does. It's explaining what is the pain of the other person. And everyone keeps saying things that salespeople are sleazy and like, no, it doesn't supposed to be like that. Have a product that answers someone's pain. They'll want to buy it. But usually a salesperson, sometimes they have struggled to buy it. Salesperson is just navigate that and make sure that they're going to make it in the most easiest way. It all starts with, hey, you're solving a real challenge. So, you entered the startup phase very convinced that you're solving a deep problem. You've experienced it yourself. You're talking to a bunch of VP engineers. You're doing your research. What is the solution that you come up with that could solve this problem for a lot of people? I saw that most people didn't even get started with test automation. And I have noticed trends. First of all, there's actually a trend. There was one that code is moving to the front end. Like every 10 years, code is moving from the back into the front and it was mainframes then that's the back end. Then it was, first of all, PC, the code was in the front end then the web came along and the servers, the code again was, a lot of the most of the code was in the back end. And now we notice, react, angular [--], like so many of the code business, critical business logic was moving to the front end and nobody knew how to test it. So, everyone I see that there's a challenge. Everyone says, "Wait a second, I used to have one line of code in the front end, which I tested manually. Now I have a million of those. How the hell do I test it?" Right. And of course, test end to end. So, we saw the trend. First of all, you see a trend and you're saying, hey, it's going to spike. The testing in the front end is going to trend. And what are the existing tools? And the existing tools, if you think about that, just understanding a megabyte 12, 15 years ago, last time the front end was in the center, it was so much information. One gigabyte it was like, oh, my God, it's so huge. The methods, things like AI didn't exist 20 years ago. Think of the change that's been since. And then you're thinking, what has changed and how can I use technology to actually solve something that's needed. So, start with that. So, you started with that. And so, what is the product now that you've been working on for the past few years that I've also had a pleasure of playing around with quite a few times? So, what we saw, what we said, wait a second, to help with end to end testing, we said, one of the biggest challenges was that the UI keeps changing all the time. And all the current technologies use one fourth that you have to say, hey, find this button based on the test. First, you have to name it. You have to do it yourself. And that's literally I could do it, calling it like almost like doing it manually. And the second thing is that it changes. The application keeps changing. As a human, for every click of a button that you have in your test, which is thousands, you can't remember. Wait a second. I use this property, but I'm going to change it. You can't remember everything. For a computer, that's like that's like a no brainer. They can follow and forever click. You can have thousands of different attributes and features and you can say, oh, I can find it in more ways than a human. Things that a human didn't even think about, I can think of ways to how to find that element. So, in here specifically, we took the pain that people had, which is how do I test faster. I want them released tomorrow, why do I need to write a test for a week. I need it in five minutes. And the challenge of, that case, it's called testability or test flakiness, and taking those challenges and saying, hey, how can I have a solution that solves those questions. Right. And that solution becomes Testim.io based out of San Francisco. Yeah. That's the beginning. After that, you see why people come to you. And the more customers you have, you understand what exactly they want. You see more challenges. And then you started seeing, hey, I can do more things. I can help them. Then they started saying, "Hey, there's duplications everywhere. How can I find out?" Then you're saying, "Oh, we can use the same technology to find all the duplications. I recommend you how to use a reusable component." Those things always come with talking to customers, understanding their challenges. Because the AI always ask one feature. You talk to them, you understand what the challenges, and then you say, hey, here's another feature which is much better. So, Oren, talk to me a little bit about this feedback cycle, this agile methodology that you're using of developing a product, watching your users, talking to them, understanding the pain points. Obviously, as somebody who's been doing it for years, as an engineer yourself, you can sympathize very, very well with these pain points. How do you then translate that into a product that doesn't yet exist? Because you're developing products that don't yet exist. You're taking pain points that do exist and you're creatively finding solutions for them through Testim.io. So, how does that process look like? I think in my case, it helps that I've been in this domain for a long time. Right. And first of all, there was a company that was willing to pay even before we had the product. Wow. That was, I think, about $60,000 contract. And I, showed them sketches. So, I think they trusted me because they saw earlier when I worked in Applitools, they saw me building a product from idea to a real product. And I think they trust this. You need to build that trust with the community. But I think it's working very closely with the customers from day zero and ongoing all the time working with them. You have one thing and that's in the beginning of a call. Let's just say someone is paying you already. You have one thing that you have to ask them at the beginning: what are your goals and how can I make you the happiest person in the universe. And then you start thinking, okay, let's do this. By the way, the trick here, the trick here is that sometimes a person's goals and the company goals, they don't necessarily all the time align. I think it's very important when you're building a product, it's also you need to start understanding how do people how do they think, what makes them happy, and where do they want to be. And it's funny because it's like I want to ask, where do you want to be in five years? You have to know that in a 30 minute conversation. And to understand that with that person, where do they want to go and make them happy. So, there's two things, when you said, when we're talking about sell, the only thing is trying to understand what people want as the individual, second thing is what makes the company or the manager, what would make the manager happy. I love that. Oren, where do you see this going in five, 10 years? The industry, not necessarily just Testim.io, but this idea of tests first and test driven mentality, where do you see us going in 10, 15 years in terms of development? First of all, I think developers is always talking about the Shift-Left that developers do testing earlier, I think developers do also the Shift-Right. Developers will be much more connected to what's going on in production all the time. When they see something, when something else doesn't work, I think that everything that's going on in production, you'll understand. First of all, what are your users doing. Right now, when someone's writing tests, they don't even know what's going on in production. That's crazy. They don't know what are their users are usually doing. Imagine that you that you do know what all your users are doing, what are the things that you didn't do, if something a bug happened that you know exactly what the scenario is, automatically. So, I think those are, but that's usually 10, 20 years. From that degree, that's going to be much sooner, I think. After that, I think there will be, you will connect more the product level. I think you'll be able to test more or define what the scenarios when you're talking about the product. This is what I want the product to be, okay, here's my test, automatically generated. Those would have to come. I love it. Yeah, I think it has to come there. It will be there. I love that. And I had the pleasure of both developing with testing and without testing. And I can definitely testify that it's a different world. And in building application, there are number of times that I found myself breaking my head against the wall when I didn't do test driven development, it was awful. So, if all my friends at Stanford and 8200, if they're listening to this, I'm a huge believer both in testing and Testim.io. And thank you for introducing me to this world. A lot of it is due to the work that you're doing with Testim.io that I got involved more and more and learn about it. So, thank you for that. But Oren, before we finish, I need to ask you for the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. And I apologize in advance that I did not tell you enough time in advance, so I'm not going to hold you accountable to that. Do I have to describe myself in three words? However you'd like to answer the question. So, first of all, I think like a lot of entrepreneurs, I am a person that loves learning. I love and I think I'm doing what I enjoying myself the most, which is I'm learning every day. Even years, even in the same company, you keep learning it all the time. So, I love that. And but things that I think the people don't know about me is that on one hand I play the guitar, I always played at least electric guitar. And on the other hand, I love rock. And on the other hand, I play Chess now, every day. Actually, not just regular Chess, it's Bughouse. It's a chess variation. Two people versus two people. So, it's a little bit more, you have to look at two boards. And this the nice part, it's of course, you have to think about, you know, 10 moves ahead, and of course, there's another board. But there's also communication with other people. So, I think, and I see you like that as well. I can see that. It's not just about technology and ideas and about cracking the, the optimal just solution on how to win your opponent, you need to have a partner. And you need to talk to them and tell them what you need. And you need them to help you out and you help them. Which is I think, this is what I love most. It's that working with people and having that feeling that we're all together. The nice thing I'm going to do right about this is two things, first, invite you to a game on Chess.com; the next one is looking at this two versus two game. Because it looks wonderful. Oren, thank you very much. Toda raba. This was just wonderful. Thank you. You're welcome my friend. Take care.
