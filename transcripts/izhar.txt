All right. Izhar. Thank you for being with us. Thank you for being my kind host overseas this evening. Of course, of course. Twelve thousand kilometers Not keeping us apart, even in times of Corona. Absolutely. So, Parliament member and former VC . and a CEO and entrepreneur and social entrepreneur and all around, incredible leader. One of the best that I know. It's not going to do justice if we even start to talk a bit about about what you did. Can you can you share a little bit about some of the things that you've done over the past several dozen years and some of the things that excite you? Oh, well You know, I started my career as a as an electronics engineer and then moved on to all kinds of capacities. I think that my most exciting times were spent as an entrepreneur. I enjoyed very much taking ideas into products, into customers' hands into building a business around them. Which I did a number of times. Two of them were with the venture backed companies that I had the privilege of running. Both of them realized successful exits for investors but that was not the main issue. the main point was really seeing your product in the hands of customers and positively influencing people around the world which was a lot of excitement, a lot of fun and, you know, self rewarding in terms of satisfaction and pride You know, all those things that I guess motivate us as individuals and so I did that And then I joined a venture capital firm in the US called Canaan Partners I was one of a team of 10 people most times where we invested in companies, mostly in the US, but also in Israel and in India and that was exciting as well, this time taking a backseat as a board member, as an investor hopefully sometimes as a value add investor I had a lot of fun And this was also rewarding in the sense of having the chance of working with very talented, bright people around the world on bringing their ideas into markets influencing positively people around the world which is again, a lot of fun, a lot of satisfaction and you know, it was also an educating journey just because you meet with so many bright people with so many great ideas. and only you can join some of them on the journey that was very exciting as well so I did all kinds of interesting things, I guess, the last year plus as wel we can speak about it as well if you want so interesting things, I think that's putting it a little bit mildly and we'll get to that. but as of last year, you're a Knesset member and you're now serving the public serving Israel and you're influencing and in ways that are very different from the way an entrepreneur or a venture capitalist can and it sounds like a pretty interesting transition, moving from high tech, very agile, move fast and break things very capitalistic to all of a sudden serving the public and bringing up bringing the social good in mind so why? why at age 55 are you now standing in the Knesset and fighting for the good of the Israeli citizens? well, you know, one day when I have the time to sit down and write my memories, I'll have to go back to this specific question and try to answer it properly at this time, I can only offer thoughts, you know, because this is an ongoing process I am more than a year into this it kind of happened all of a sudden, although I had been so to speak, in public service for quite some time you know, as a volunteer yes, a venture capitalist but that aside, as a volunteer I ran a not for profit organization that dealt with and still is dealing now without me, but dealt with the youth around the country here in Israel coming from challenging socio-economic backgrounds so those young adults were under the great support and care of our volunteers around the country so I did start for more than 10 years very hard as a volunteer on integrating various people into the Israeli high-tech you worked with the Haredis as well, right? say that again you worked with the Haredis as well, quite a bit So, yeah. So my point was trying to integrate people who come from communities which are not necessarily integrated properly into the Israeli high-tech, integrating those people into their high tech bubble served two main causes one of them is just giving them equal opportunities and providing them with the appropriate platform to go about their desires and so improving their economics but also there was also a bigger cause, which was this is important for the Israeli society you know, bringing people together from different communities, different backgrounds is something that we are missing badly over here so I did that, and then so, at a certain point and juncture, I came across this opportunity of joining the political life which was a very tough decision leaving all those exciting, interesting and fun lifestyles and and just to, you know, way of going about life that was a lot of fun and very rewarding personally and also, you know, the kind of life I think I would be happy to go back one day, 20, 30 years from now so I had to leave all of these behind me and join the political arena but I think that they did it because I understood that what I did as a volunteer can scale up in a significant way If I am willing to take the responsibility and willing to  take upon the challenge and turn my life completely upside down from a private entrepreneur and venture capital to becoming a public figure that's a hell of a change I did this and here I am I mean, you took you took a really non-traditional approach I mean, a lot of politicians, they started in politics from a very, very junior position and then their dream is to even hopefully one day become close to being a Knesset member and you really jumped into the ship of some really, really amazing people and over a year fought really for democracy as the main stance more than anything and now you're talking about the high tech technology within government now those two things don't make sense to me I mean, when you think of government, at least I guess up until my generation and a bit beyond, you think of slow moving, you think of bureaucracy. you think of it's all about the budget for this and budget for that and now you're coming in and saying, let's do it high tech what does that mean? can governments be agile? can governments pivot when they need to? wow, you nailed this Michael, right to the point so, you know, it is a huge challenge governments are slow, very bureaucratic huge operations in many cases unnecessarily big and with so many processes that kind of go against innovation, against agile approaches to anything and then you go into this and say, I'm going to introduce change so, yes, it is a huge challenge, but it is part of the transformation any nation with emphasis on, democratic nations, they have to go through so, you know, technology has taken the world has taken the world through a significant breakthrough and we have all seen a leap forward of changing the way we run our lives personally on the business side, on the community side everywhere around us, governments are still way behind and very slow to respond but governments who want to to survive have to go through that transition you know, your generation will not be willing to accept a government that slows down your personal developmental your desires, your willingness to do stuff quickly and efficiently it's a way of life, right so here is a huge challenge I think that I am in a good position to realize that the need is there, that it is a critical need, and we have to start that transition so, you know, I think that other people already started this transition not only in Israel, but in other democracies like in the US and elsewhere there's a lot to be done and I think that we are here in Israel in a position, in a good position to try to push things forward, because we are a startup nation because there are so many technologies, breakthrough technologies that are being developed here and because we are a small country overall, the positive noise, the positive technology and innovation noise has gone across just the high tech community so many people around the country, some of them understand the notion of innovation and they also grew, too, to know, to demand better from the government just because they see things managed differently elsewhere and so this is the some sort of a turning point where people around the country realized that a change is needed, a change is possible, and we, the politicians, have the duty of introducing those changes so let me give you a number of examples we want to provide a a much better efficient service to the public. most of the service where the government faces the public in Israel and by the way, elsewhere as well still requires many face to face interactions many paper based interactions and and sort of old world ways of running your business so, you know, my vision is hopefully a number of years from now by law, all Israeli government offices and authorities will be required to have an electronic interface with anybody who requires so, you know, I have my parents they're 80 plus years old they want to interface person to person, and that's totally fine but your generation, you know, you would probably find it hard to believe that you need to go somewhere you need to file a paper, you need to interface with a clerk It's really unacceptable and there's no reason for that so we have to go through that transition I should say that a number of Israeli officers, Israeli governmental officers, have started to go through that transition But still, there is a long way to go luckily, again, we are startup nation. there are so many technology, so many products that have been developed over here to improve the efficiency of processes to provide better service to customers to manage all kinds of processes in a much better way so all of this, interesting enough, is being sold outside of Israel just because Israeli entrepreneurs do not want to deal with the government rightfully so, I was an entrepreneur I have scars of trying to sell to the Israeli government so I know what it takes but if you just improve that facet of the government, you suddenly see the Israeli municipalities taking advantage of so many smart cities technologies that have been developed in Israel but are sold exclusively elsewhere out of the country you see so many technologies that can improve the efficiency, the productivity, the security of government agencies sold elsewhere that can be integrated into our government over here so that's an example And I just touched upon kind of the surface this is a trivial transition you know, going paperless, going electronically and so on, but there are so many other layers that one could think about and we have so many good ideas that, you know, I could spend the next 20 years or more integrating interesting ideas that will be a lot of fun venture capitalists, you're sitting and I have the privilege now of experiencing a little taste of it here in Silicon Valley and, you know, you're sitting there and you're trying to think of a business proposition an opportunity to change consumer behavior, to improve the lives of many and then you're sitting on your side of the table as the venture capitalist and trying to think, is this viable? and I grow this into a scalable business that will actually bring value to people? and I can't help but make the comparison that sitting in the position that you are now, you're seeing all these propositions all the time do you find yourself ever putting on this venture capitalist hat and trying to assess whether if this was a startup that came and proposed whether I believe this entrepreneur whether I believe this model that they're suggesting oh, absolutely let me give you an example, Michael it's an interesting analogy you know, here's something I learned every parliament member is actually some sort of a PNL unit so really, you know, here in Israel, we have 120 parliament members each of whom makes decisions as to what to focus on and what to invest their time in and there are many opportunities to advance all kinds of laws all kinds of public services and one has to focus one has to decide what is their specific advantage, what are their desires and what is that you really want to promote? you know, every day, every day, as a public servant, I get approached by many people who rightfully so have all kinds of interesting ideas all kinds of desires or all kinds of problems and you have to make that decision you have to make the decision of, you know, I want to focus on certain areas I'm going to specialize in those areas I want to provide service to certain constituents and by doing this, by the way, I realized that I give up others so it's not an easy decision pretty much the same way venture capitalists work, you know, as a VC partner I would see about 1000 opportunities every year obviously, as you know, I would have not been able to deal with even 1 percent of them and if I did two to three deals a year, I would feel pretty good about it same here you know, just to give you a sense the previous full term Knesset that worked in Israel was the 20th Knesset it worked for about four years and it was able to to put together about 400 plus laws, you know, in Israel but the number of law proposals that were submitted were about 6000 law proposals from the get go so here's your ratio if you think about this, about 6000 law proposals that were filtered in not by VCs, but by Knesset members so each of those basic members probably looked at at least 3 to 5 times that number and they decided to narrow down to about 6000 law proposals and four years later, you see that about 400. so I'll say like 7-8% of them were really transacted so this is like taking the VC approach and understanding it and then kind of mapping it to what the process looks like in my life today and frankly, my life as a VC is helpful here I learned to prioritize, to understand where my added value stands and to force myself to focus while realizing that I may be giving up other opportunities as well and you probably can't say it yourself, but honestly, it probably is from the VC perspective you also know sometimes to cut the bullshit and to and to get to the point and know some of the things that go behind what's actually behind the PowerPoint presentation and I'm sure that that gives a lot of value as well I can give you an interesting example of how all this combines, if you want yeah, of course so, you know, these are corona times, corona virus times, I should say and one of the things we are, one of the big challenges we are facing as the parliament here in Israel is the significant, realistic, fear that sometime over the next few days or few weeks, we may find many of us, parliament members out of the Knesset, out of the parliament either being instructed to stay home because we were close to somebody who was infected or one or some, some of us may be infected themselves so here is the challenge the Israeli parliament by a very significant law we call them foundation laws this is like the constitution translated into Israeli terms we do not have a constitution here, but we have basic laws that kind of control the way we govern our democracy one of these laws dictates that any discussion and voting must take in person in the Knesset if you are not in the Knesset, you are not allowed to vote you are not allowed to be part of the discussion and interestingly enough, throughout the 72 years of the Israeli parliament, there was never a session that was prevented from being handled because of anything so you know, sometimes there used to be emergency cases you know, we were attacked here and there so we stopped for 24 hours, but you continue the discussion and the voting process so that democracy continues to run but nobody ever thought that you may find a situation where people cannot go in person to do this and by the way, we have provisions of substituting the Knesset building into some other building, there are all kinds of backup buildings so, gathering is possible but the notion of doing this electronically was never considered not for technology reasons, but just for you could call this basic democracy you want to see the person in person so I used my experience and submitted an urgent law proposal to the Knesset where we are kind of running against time you know, it takes time to process law sometimes it takes two to three years sometimes it takes a few months it rarely takes a few days but we're running against time and so the clock is ticking we submitted a law proposal this week, and we hope to be able to bring it up to discussion on Monday, next week which is a record breaking pace and that law will allow for a limited amount of time and for very specific cases, which are people that have to be isolated by the orders of the ministry of health, or they have been infected but they will be allowed to log in electronically and they will be allowed to discuss and to vote, which is a very significant precedence we have to go through all the motions, we sat with top lawyers here in Israel constitutional lawyers and others and we have come up with the right formula that kind of satisfies everybody and now we are running against time the real fear is that we will not have enough people to vote on submitting and for an approach in approving this law before people are being isolated so here's a combination of everything you have the VC guy, the technology guy and the parliament member who are trying to put all of this together very, very fascinating wow, best of luck I mean, that's just inspiring to hear from my end Izhar, you have to go back to running the country but three words that describe you wow dreamier, optimistic, passionate. I love it Izhar thank you so, so much Loved having you here take good care of yourself, please take care stay healthy bye bye
