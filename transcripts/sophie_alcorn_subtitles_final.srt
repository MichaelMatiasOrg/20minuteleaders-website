1
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,600
All right. Sophie Alcorn,

2
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,600
thank you for being on my show

3
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,360
20 Minute Leaders.

4
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,920
How are you?

5
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,720
Hi Michael. I'm doing great.

6
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,520
It is really awesome to be here.

7
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,080
Thank you so much.

8
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,520
Well, thank you for giving me

9
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,280
your generous time

10
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,160
even in the late evening.

11
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,520
I really appreciate it.

12
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,160
Sophie, who are you?

13
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,200
Where are you even calling from right now?

14
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,360
I am calling you

15
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,000
from Mountain View, California.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
I live in Silicon Valley,

17
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,440
San Francisco Bay Area,

18
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,520
so very close to Stanford.

19
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,120
And I am an immigration attorney.

20
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,240
I'm a top 10 California

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,920
immigration lawyer, certified specialist

22
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,320
by the state bar and my law firm,

23
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,440
Alcorn Immigration Law,

24
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,240
focuses on startup immigration.

25
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,920
So, it's great to be here.

26
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,520
Wonderful.

27
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,360
Okay, so there's much to talk about.

28
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,080
Before we get to startup immigration,

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,040
what is immigration law in its essence?

30
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,840
And obviously, this is something that

31
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,880
immigration, ever since

32
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,880
the past decade I think,

33
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,320
has been somewhat of a heated topic

34
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,960
in this country as I'm starting to learn.

35
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,720
Give me a little bit of context as to why

36
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,240
this is such a complicated matter,

37
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,840
and what is immigration law?

38
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,160
I love that question.

39
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,240
That's such a brilliant,

40
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,760
I love starting with the philosophical.

41
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,480
Immigration is people want to move.

42
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,560
We're on this globe, and the land

43
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,760
doesn't come with walls, but we build them

44
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,640
and then we want to get past them.

45
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,440
And so, immigration law

46
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,280
is helping people navigate

47
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,040
those walls and borders.

48
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,800
And it's an especially interesting time

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
to think about it

50
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,600
not just because

51
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,640
of all the political things

52
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,320
that are happening and covid, but also

53
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,200
augmented reality, virtual reality,

54
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,520
future of work, like what is

55
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,640
immigration going to be in the future.

56
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,040
So immigration, as the world

57
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,600
is becoming more globalized,

58
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,920
as a young entrepreneur,

59
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,920
I'm imagining that there should be

60
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,080
a pretty linear correlation:

61
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,880
the more globalized the world is,

62
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,520
the easier it will be for people

63
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,080
to move between countries.

64
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,040
Now, of course, I'm imagining

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,080
you're specializing in the US,

66
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,840
but is this the case?

67
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,480
Or, because it doesn't seem so from the news

68
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,840
that it's becoming easier

69
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,500
as the world gets more globalized.

70
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, certainly in the United States

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,480
it's becoming harder.

72
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,680
And other countries,

73
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,240
over the last couple decades,

74
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,440
have also been on a path towards

75
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,440
increased restrictionism and xenophobia,

76
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,680
which might be a backlash

77
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,500
to globalization.

78
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,480
For people in the know

79
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,920
it may be easier than ever,

80
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,200
but it's not obvious in every situation.

81
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,560
Right.

82
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,840
So, what is the context of immigration law

83
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,680
within the sphere of Silicon Valley?

84
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,480
Is it the same as just

85
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,320
regular immigration law or not?

86
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,840
No, it's different and it's wonderful,

87
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,520
I think, it's so fun.

88
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,000
I love the brilliant minds that come here

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,120
from all over the world

90
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,960
drawn by places like Stanford,

91
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,240
Berkeley, Google, Apple.

92
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,800
People are so excited to come here

93
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,960
and start companies

94
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,560
and meet venture capitalists,

95
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,840
and so I'm thrilled because I get to talk

96
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,560
to brilliant people every day

97
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,320
who are working on such

98
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,800
diverse pursuits and topics.

99
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,840
So, immigration law is different here

100
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,360
than in the rest of the country,

101
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,120
and I practiced

102
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,600
in different areas geographically.

103
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,720
And in some of my

104
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,480
prior legal incarnations,

105
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,840
it was more about

106
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,080
supporting undocumented people

107
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,760
or victims of domestic violence

108
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,400
or children who had been separated

109
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,880
from their families, human trafficking.

110
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,040
There's lots of really intense things

111
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,000
that go on with respect to immigration

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,760
that are very important.

113
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:18,920
And legally speaking, as a practitioner,

114
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,680
it's very challenging because the law

115
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,520
is stacked against people

116
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,720
in these situations often,

117
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,600
and it can definitely lead to burnout

118
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,320
and compassion fatigue,

119
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,600
which I experienced.

120
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,870
...

121
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,160
...

122
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,830
...

123
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay, great. So in prior times

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,600
in my law career,

125
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,720
I did a lot of really intense cases

126
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,120
that led me to have compassion fatigue

127
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,240
that were super meaningful

128
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,400
and also extremely challenging.

129
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,920
So like asylum, domestic violence,

130
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,480
human trafficking, deportation.

131
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:27,360
And so, I welcome the opportunity

132
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,000
that I have now

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,600
to work with really bright people,

134
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,960
to learn from my clients as entrepreneurs

135
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,040
who think about disruption

136
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,200
and system change.

137
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,920
And yes, I can do some of that

138
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,440
pro bono work right now,

139
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,640
but I'm also looking at ways

140
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,360
to create more systemic change and reform

141
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,560
and to bring what we can model here out

142
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,760
to the rest of the country and

143
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,680
potentially the world.

144
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,920
Sure. So, take me back a little bit

145
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,880
because it doesn't seem

146
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,840
like this is just something

147
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,560
somebody stumbles onto and says,

148
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,320
"Oh okay, I'm gonna be

149
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
an immigration attorney

150
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,960
and I'm gonna found my own firm"

151
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,880
a very, very successful firm

152
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
in Silicon Valley of all places.

153
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,640
So, give me your background.

154
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,440
How do you even get

155
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,280
sucked into this world?

156
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,080
So, my dad was an immigration lawyer.

157
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,040
My mom is an immigrant from Germany.

158
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,280
She was his client.

159
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,120
And so, I grew up

160
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,160
in an immigrant household

161
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,680
with a dad who was, in the '80s,

162
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,880
loving being like David versus Goliath

163
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,960
and doing all these

164
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,880
crazy deportation battles

165
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,120
and being in the courtroom.

166
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,760
He was a former Marine,

167
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,120
and he loved the adrenaline of that.

168
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,960
And he had his own immigration law firm

169
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,360
in Southern California.

170
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,160
And so I grew up, we would have people

171
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,720
over for dinner and it was normal

172
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,400
to have Ukrainian nuclear physicists

173
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,000
and Vietnamese businessmen

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,400
and artists and singers.

175
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,800
So, my parents definitely cultivated

176
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,880
that appreciation for just getting

177
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,240
to know people from all over the world.

178
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,840
And I worked for my dad,

179
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,840
and from compassion fatigue kind of

180
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,520
burned out after a couple years,

181
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,640
and that's the time in my life

182
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,880
when I had my kids.

183
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,760
And through, my marriage ended up

184
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,680
back in Silicon Valley

185
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,040
where my ex and I had met at Stanford.

186
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,160
And so, we came back here for his job,

187
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,560
and I was a stay at home mom

188
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,200
for several years.

189
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,840
Didn't have a professional network

190
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,880
in the Bay Area, just maybe

191
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,440
a handful of friends from college

192
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,520
who I was still a little bit connected with.

193
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:10,760
But my, it was a lot. It is a crazy story.

194
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,800
Basically, my dad

195
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,680
passed away unexpectedly.

196
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,920
I had argued with him about disinherit, like

197
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,840
I wanted to disinherit myself

198
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,720
not knowing that he was going to die,

199
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,000
but then he did.

200
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,880
And I didn't know

201
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,160
he was gonna disinherit me

202
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,200
but he did.

203
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:33,920
And then, I got to the point

204
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,440
of my prior marriage where

205
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,400
it also wasn't going to work anymore.

206
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,120
So, I was a mom to a toddler and preschooler

207
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,560
who didn't have a career

208
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,320
and was trying to figure out a way

209
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,480
to pay rent in Silicon Valley.

210
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,920
And I really wanted to be an entrepreneur

211
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,480
and I thought about

212
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,200
going to coding school,

213
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,800
but it seemed like that would maybe

214
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,200
not be the quickest way

215
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,640
to get into the ecosystem.

216
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,440
Wow.

217
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,080
So, I started the firm out of my kitchen,

218
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,320
and it's grown really fast

219
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,760
over the last four and a half,

220
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,000
five years since I started it.

221
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,120
So, you start the firm

222
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,880
out of your kitchen.

223
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,340
You say,

224
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,120
"I could go to a coding school,

225
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,120
but I'll just start a law firm."

226
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,840
Give me a little bit of taste as to what

227
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,600
Alcorn Immigration Law is today.

228
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,160
What is this group?

229
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,040
How many cases do you see?

230
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,160
It is one of the

231
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,560
most well known firms in the country

232
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,880
for immigration law,

233
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,800
but what's happening now with it?

234
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,520
Well, we've bootstrapped.

235
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,600
We have about a team

236
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,080
of 15 attorneys and paralegals.

237
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,560
We have a distributed team

238
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,640
across the country

239
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,960
which we've had for a while,

240
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,640
so that was great

241
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,320
to have in place pre-covid.

242
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,120
We kind of went digital.

243
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,520
And we have helped thousands

244
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,440
of international individuals

245
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,520
from all over the world

246
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,880
get visas and green cards

247
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,560
to live and work legally in the States.

248
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,600
We focus on entrepreneurs and investors,

249
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,040
inventors, researchers, engineers.

250
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,200
And from the law firm base,

251
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,840
I've started a podcast,

252
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,800
"Immigration Law for Tech Startups"

253
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,080
I'm a TechCrunch contributor

254
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,840
with a weekly immigration

255
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,120
advice column, Dear Sophie.

256
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,960
And it's really fun.

257
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
Things are happening really fast.

258
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,280
Tell me a little bit about this column.

259
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,080
So TechCrunch column,

260
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,320
Dear Sophie. How does it work?

261
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,800
So, basically people write in

262
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,400
their immigration questions,

263
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,000
and then every week

264
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,720
I answer somebody's questions

265
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,520
with an in-depth legal educational article

266
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,120
about the technical details

267
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
of immigration law,

268
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,720
and it's within the Extra Crunch brand

269
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,680
that TechCrunch has.

270
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
What is the most complicated part

271
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,000
of immigration law?

272
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,240
So, what are some things

273
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,200
that, obviously the whole thing

274
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,880
to somebody who's not a lawyer is like

275
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,240
a black box that I have no idea

276
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,800
how anything over there works.

277
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,320
But what are some of the deep complexity

278
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,520
that you have to deal with

279
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,840
on a daily basis to help people

280
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,640
get access to this country?

281
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,000
Well, the stories are so moving.

282
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,200
I mean, just within the last 24 hours,

283
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,440
the people I've spoken with,

284
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,160
like a startup founder

285
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,560
who won a bunch of awards

286
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,360
got stuck in Canada,

287
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,720
got denied her visa,

288
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,040
and is now trying to figure out a way

289
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,920
to come back in,

290
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,680
and somebody really wants to hire her.

291
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,640
Do they start a company in Canada

292
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,600
just so she can work there for a year?

293
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,440
Wow. Really?

294
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,160
Yeah.

295
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,200
And then another startup founder

296
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,640
who's trying to break away

297
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,560
from his company,

298
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,240
and he needs to lay the plan to do it

299
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,040
without jeopardizing his current job.

300
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,400
But his co-founder needs to be secure.

301
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,040
But they're trying to get a contract

302
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,680
and they don't want to violate

303
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,720
their offer letter or any non-disclosure

304
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,560
of confidential information stuff.

305
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,960
So, how do they start the company

306
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,240
without working there

307
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,080
and without violating that?

308
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,800
And then, so that was just the morning.

309
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,400
And then somebody with a friend

310
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,880
who's trying to have

311
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,840
the wife and kid live here,

312
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,880
but they don't have a way to stay.

313
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,320
Then somebody stuck in India

314
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,960
working at a big tech company

315
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,560
who the government is really scrutinizing

316
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,640
whether she's extraordinary or not.

317
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,640
Wow.

318
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,320
And then, somebody else who just found out

319
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,240
from a big company

320
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,800
that their visas got denied,

321
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,480
but this means that,

322
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,640
since their last status expired

323
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,600
like four months ago,

324
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,760
that they have to basically

325
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,720
leave immediately.

326
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,640
They don't know if their company

327
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,000
is gonna bring them back in,

328
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,320
if the company cares enough,

329
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,280
so how do they find a way to stay.

330
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,160
That was just today.

331
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,640
I didn't even like roll back

332
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,120
for the last 24 hours.

333
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,880
Wow.

334
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,080
That's unbelievable.

335
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,080
So, I mean, is this also

336
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,720
the best part of the job?

337
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,200
Getting to hear everybody's stories

338
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,800
and getting exposed to.

339
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,440
Because these are like big life decisions, right?

340
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,800
Like where am I going to be based and live.

341
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,040
This is not just, you know,

342
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,320
this is serious stuff.

343
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,880
It's really serious stuff.

344
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,640
The best thing is winning.

345
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,320
The best thing is taking

346
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,160
the impossible situation

347
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,320
and transforming it,

348
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,400
and somebody getting

349
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,560
their sense of freedom

350
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,680
for the first time in their life.

351
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,640
What is the success ratio

352
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,120
of something like this?

353
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,720
Well, take the H-1B visa, for example,

354
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,560
which is a very common working visa

355
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,480
for professionals.

356
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,320
Under Obama and prior administrations

357
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,760
it was approved about 93% of the time

358
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,320
and maybe 5% of the time

359
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,000
there was something called

360
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,600
a request for evidence.

361
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,680
Under the current administration,

362
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,120
the last statistic

363
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,520
I saw the approval rate declined.

364
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,680
It was at 93%,

365
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,680
now it was hovering at 70%.

366
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,520
Really?

367
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,920
And the requests for evidence had gone up

368
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,960
from 5% to 30%.

369
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:23,080
So, it's gotten very intense,

370
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,920
but we are still winning those.

371
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,240
I cannot guarantee

372
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,400
any future outcome ethically,

373
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,440
but historically speaking,

374
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,320
looking at past data, we have been winning

375
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,880
H-1Bs like 97% of the time.

376
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,800
Wow.

377
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,760
Okay. That's incredible.

378
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,800
And so, is the engagement with the client,

379
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,280
is the lifetime or it just that

380
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,480
that one act of getting that visa?

381
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,080
Or is it something that's ongoing

382
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,240
and you need to have continuous support

383
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,640
and engagement with them?

384
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,240
Well, so we're focusing

385
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,560
on the startup ecosystem.

386
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,320
So, we start with the founder

387
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,800
who's often an immigrant,

388
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,120
get their immigration situation figured out,

389
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,600
and then stick with them

390
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,680
through the raises, the growth,

391
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,520
and basically to bring on

392
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
whole engineering teams

393
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,160
often in deep tech.

394
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,920
And for any one individual,

395
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,720
it's like a visa, a green card,

396
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,760
and then citizenship,

397
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,440
but they might have

398
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,200
several different types of visas

399
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,400
before they ever get a green card.

400
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,120
Right. And so, when

401
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,560
there are different firms

402
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,760
that are helping startups grow,

403
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,040
a lot of the times they'll take,

404
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,520
let's say, equity,

405
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
and join the company's venture

406
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,320
...

407
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,400
and it doesn't sound like

408
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,160
this is something that could be fitting perhaps

409
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,320
to this model.

410
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,080
Does it happen?

411
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,200
Or is this all engagements with people

412
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,360
but you're just knowledgeable

413
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,720
about the company that they're starting?

414
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,960
Well, because you asked,

415
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,240
I have not historically

416
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,240
been able to do that,

417
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,120
but I'm actually trying to recruit

418
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,440
an MBA intern volunteer,

419
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,520
ideally from a place like Stanford,

420
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,000
who can help write the business plan

421
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,440
for the immigrant focused accelerator

422
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,000
that I want to form

423
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,440
that we have VC interest for.

424
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,600
And with that structure in place,

425
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,800
we would then be able to do

426
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,880
like immigration for equity sort of thing.

427
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,000
Wow. Okay.

428
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,840
That's very, very cool.

429
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,440
Give me a little bit of higher context

430
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,480
as to where we're headed.

431
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,400
And I mean, immigration,

432
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,040
it's such a complicated concept

433
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,160
on its own, but where is this

434
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,720
whole ecosystem headed?

435
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,160
And what needs to change

436
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,800
for things to get better

437
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,560
if they do need to get better?

438
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,000
A lot of places in the world have realized

439
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,320
because they have not been

440
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,880
as economically privileged

441
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,320
as the United States has been

442
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,760
in recent decades,

443
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,360
that immigration is actually great

444
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,920
for the economy, for creating jobs,

445
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,800
and for increasing the quality of life

446
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
of their citizens.

447
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,440
So, in the next 5, 10 years,

448
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,400
I think the US is at a critical point,

449
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,560
and I want to help usher us forward

450
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,240
into appreciating the value

451
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,080
and contributions of immigrants.

452
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,600
And I think that that could be a real key

453
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,160
to getting out of the economic situation

454
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,160
that we currently find ourselves in

455
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,350
'cause immigrants create jobs.

456
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,000
... to be an immigrant.

457
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,640
Right.

458
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,600
So, it sounds like it's really contentious

459
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
in a place like the United States

460
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,200
because of nationalism

461
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,640
and some arguments about the economy.

462
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,480
At the end, you're seeing it very

463
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,080
from a humane perspective of-

464
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,240
Well, I mean, whatever your motivation is.

465
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,480
Like if you just want to talk about money,

466
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,600
immigrants have money.

467
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,040
Like if you want to talk

468
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,240
about human rights,

469
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,040
it's the right thing to do.

470
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,440
If you want to talk about kindness

471
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,480
and loving your neighbor

472
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,320
and that if we help one person

473
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,240
it helps us all,

474
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,160
we can have it that way, too.

475
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,640
So, it's a win win.

476
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,360
So, five years ago,

477
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,000
starting out in your kitchen,

478
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,800
now, you're running a 15 person law firm

479
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,720
that's recognized as one of the top

480
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,560
for immigration law.

481
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,680
What's next? Where are you headed?

482
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,600
So many things.

483
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,280
I need to hop off this call

484
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,200
in a couple minutes

485
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,040
because I'm having my first

486
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,320
diplomatic Zoom meeting

487
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,640
with a minister of a country

488
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,960
to talk about their innovation economy

489
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,080
and supporting women and children

490
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,320
through innovation.

491
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,160
Wow. Amazing

492
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,480
So, it's really exciting.

493
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,280
The accelerator is on there.

494
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,760
I founded a nonprofit called

495
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,040
The Community for Global Innovation.

496
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,960
We're looking for tech companies

497
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,200
to take the pledge that they are

498
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,360
open to hiring international graduates

499
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,040
and won't hold that against them.
- Wonderful

500
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,720
The sky's the limit.

501
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,680
I love it. I love it.

502
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,760
Okay. So, I have to release you

503
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,880
to go talk to the minister of innovation.

504
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,440
But before that,

505
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,920
I need three words that you would use

506
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,680
to describe yourself

507
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,520
and why those three words.

508
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,960
Okay.

509
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,600
Driven, I think you know why.

510
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,560
Adventurous, because I love having

511
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,440
new adventures and trying new things.

512
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,040
And silly,

513
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,440
because I'm actually really quite silly.

514
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,080
I love it.

515
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,400
Sophie, thank you so, so much

516
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,720
for your time and for the inspiration.

517
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,640
And best of luck winning every case

518
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
and helping every person

519
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,360
fulfill their personal dream

520
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,160
whether it's personal or professional.

521
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,680
Thank you very much. Take care.

522
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,360
Thank you so much. Bye.

523
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,480
Bye bye.

524
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,080
Wonderful.
