00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,880
Alon Matas

2
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,760
thank you for being here

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,560
thank you for having me

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:25,920
all right

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,560
so

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,760
better help, Corona online therapy

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,080
we only have 20 minutes

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,440
but I want to talk about this for an hour

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,600
what is better help?
and then let's dive into why this is so relevant

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,560
and March of 2020

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,800
it's already April

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,040
so better help is the largest online
counseling service

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,520
was wide and started six years ago

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,200
we have a network of forewords 7000

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,120
licensed therapists nationwide

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,200
and we connect people who are looking for
mental health help

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,320
with one of these licensed therapists

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,440
based on their needs and preferences,
where they can go to

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,320
a counseling online

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,320
pretty similar to the one they would have
in a brick and mortar

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,160
but with four options of communication

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,800
messaging, which is a synchronous, you
send

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,320
a message to your therapist any time you
want it

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,800
to be like e-mail, get a response,
usually seeing you day after

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,080
or you schedule like sessions over
phone, video or chat

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,480
we have around a little over

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,640
2 million interactions every month

28
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,320
or months in Corona

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,440
definitely

30
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,200
it's anything but usual

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,240
as people need more,

32
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,280
we need more therapy and help given the

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,240
stress, anxiety and even loneliness with
shelter-in-place

34
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,960
coming to most states

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,560
And of course, the inability to actually
go to see a therapist

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,040
in the office if you wanted to


37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,240
OK

38
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,040
so way too many questions am

39
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,400
I have to go back a little bit

40
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,120
now, you're not coming from the therapy
world

41
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,840
you're not a psychologist

42
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,900
and did you even come from healthcare,
general, and before?

43
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,680
no,

44
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,080
not at all

45
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,200
how did you get to build this?

46
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,960
so I'm coming from a consumer products

47
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,480
background of

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,000
being in this space for

49
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,520
18 years now, of interacting

50
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,320
with consumers on marketplaces and
different kinds of services

51
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,680
and I'm not coming from counseling

52
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,320
I'm not coming from health care

53
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,880
there's a whole debate about whether

54
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,200
farmers should come from the domain from
outside of the domain

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,080
definitely lots of examples, Uber

56
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,760
or BMB and you name it, of

57
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,720
better health help their verticals and hope

58
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,280
that were founded by people

59
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,120
who came outside of their domain

60
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,680
there are some advantages that leave
fresh thinking,

61
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,200
usually more line of thought that

62
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,320
it's aligned with what consumers want

63
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,040
rather than what the system is used

64
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,800
to provide, and maybe convenience the
system by the traditional way

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,680
obviously we have therapists

66
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,080
on the team and we, all the clinical staff

67
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,080
I'm not making any clinical decisions
whatsoever,

68
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,360
but our concerned

69
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,920
from day one was we wanted to create

70
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,100
something that people actually wanted
people use because

71
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,640
instead we argue with therapy

72
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,760
and that's not Corona related is,

73
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,960
it's a huge deal of a lot of people, but
most people actually don't use that

74
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,600
so you broke your leg

75
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
or you coughing today

76
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,240
you're going to see a doctor in

77
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,520
90% plus of the cases

78
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,400
but most people who struggle with mental
health, even

79
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,960
very significant struggles, will

80
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,760
avoid going to therapy

81
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,800
so you have research shows that you have
around 25% at any given time,

82
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,800
has a serious mental health issue

83
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,640
that should be
addressed by a professional

84
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,560
but at any given time, very few of them
would actually go to sleep

85
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,160
why? because if it's expensive, it's
inaccessible

86
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,200
it's inconvenient

87
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,600
I experienced this myself when,

88
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,720
socially unacceptable sometimes

89
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,400
there is a lot of stigma

90
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,440
and I experience myself when I thought,
you know, maybe in the last

91
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,680
days of my previous company for the
better health care to be, I want

92
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,000
see a therapist and I thought, OK,
that's that should be easy

93
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,160
it was anything but easy

94
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,760
so it's it's really

95
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,960
a very, very needed service therapy as a
whole

96
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,360
that can change people's lives

97
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,560
it's really amazing how people's I can
change

98
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,720
and sometimes pretty quickly, with the
help of a true professional

99
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,960
that is train

100
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,880
in and has the right expertise,

101
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,760
but still so few people actually use them

102
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,360
so our approach and that may be

103
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,160
a different approach by the company,
especially the last two, three years,

104
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,560
was not to disrupt therapy,

105
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,360
not say, oh, we've got to do AI, we're not
going to do about it

106
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,240
it's a whole different way of therapy,

107
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,560
which is the exact opposite approach
that we want

108
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,440
therapy is a tried and true science that
is studied

109
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,120
and proved over so many years

110
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,240
we're going to give is a,

111
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,360
as it is, it's the same therapist that
you see in brick and mortar

112
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,200
it's the same type of

113
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,160
interactions and it goes

114
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,720
what we're changing, what we're
disrupting is

115
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,960
the delivery mechanism

116
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,480
so it's the way people communicate with a
therapist

117
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,280
make it more accessible, more convenient

118
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,140
and eventually also more affordable

119
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,240
OK, so I'm one of the biggest advocates, I think
in the world for

120
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,160
four therapy, practicing and myself with
a professional

121
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,280
and I believe that every person in the
world needs to see

122
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,040
a therapist because it's having the
subjective

123
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,640
persona that's able to help you reflect
on what

124
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,000
you're feeling and believing

125
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,720
I think it's just it's a privilege

126
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,040
and that that we have

127
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,840
and unfortunately, in most people in the
world can't afford

128
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,720
it or it's not accessible

129
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,080
and so what you're doing is amazing,
but you're also making a lot of money

130
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,880
I'm sure you are

131
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,760
millions of, you said 2 million sessions,
2 million sessions a month

132
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,320
and I'm guessing

133
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,960
I remember that what was the last
number that you shared

134
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,840
with me and the total number of sessions
that were through better help

135
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,820
so far, we had around 65 million of messages,
video calls, phone calls,

136
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,940
insane

137
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,640
how do you balance this idea that you're

138
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,160
creating a business that is, you know,

139
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,960
at the end of it, it's it's a good business

140
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,400
it's social good

141
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,560
you're helping so many people at the same
time you're making money

142
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,760
do you find any contradiction there?

143
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,760
do is, people challenge you on that
sometimes?

144
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,520
there's always the notion of, oh, you're
making you know, you're making

145
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,000
money of people's misery

146
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,600
but that's, I think, coming

147
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,520
to so many professions from doctors to
mechanics

148
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,720
Yeah, I can make money when
your car breaks

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,520
and doctors make money when your body
breaks and where,

150
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,940
that's why people hate insurance
companies, right?

151
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,280
Yeah, it's, we provide a solution

152
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,400
and so I definitely feel

153
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,040
comfortable, especially that we make

154
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,840
it much more affordable

155
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,400
but yes, mental health is a touchy

156
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,840
topic, I think

157
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,960
and smarter people said it before me

158
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,800
that the 4th profit model

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,480
is when you can make it work

160
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,120
is actually what brings the most value

161
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,760
to mankind

162
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,320
maybe it's a fortune
that's the way it is

163
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,040
but that's that's reality

164
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,760
so if you can make a sustainable business
and make good sometime

165
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,760
that's perfect

166
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,640
But we do recognize that we have
you know

167
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,320
extra responsibility here, which was
why, for example,

168
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,760
we have a very extensive
financial aid program

169
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,360
so if you sign up for a service, if you can't
afford that service,

170
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,080
we provide
financial aid in very serious discounts

171
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,880
we keep paying therapists the same as
therapies are

172
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,680
unaware that even you may be getting
financial aid because

173
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,680
we think that they should focus under on
their job

174
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,440
and we subsidize, we give kind of a free service

175
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,640
to, you know, when there is a time of

176
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,760
nature disaster or in the time of Corona

177
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,400
we also give some groups a

178
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,160
free or very discounted service

179
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,920
so we try to help wherever we can

180
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,560
but yes, we're a full profit corporation

181
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,120
Yeah

182
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,040
we're also need to support the therapies that,

183
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,120
I think it's I think it's completely right

184
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,640
I mean, I completely agree with that

185
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,240
and I I love this this idea of

186
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,960
a win win situation and then really

187
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,280
creating incentives for both groups to
maximize on it

188
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,700
and you know I got to start working recently
at Hippo Insurance

189
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,320
and I get to see firsthand

190
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,840
you insurance company

191
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,000
and, you know, just the word insurance
makes some people vomit

192
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,680
but all of a sudden, you're seeing a new
type of company come up and

193
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,640
really try to think, how can we make
their user experience

194
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,400
better so that they don't see us as the
enemy, but as a friend

195
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,960
and I think I'm learning a lot through
that experience and I'm really

196
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,320
making analogies to what's happening
with better help

197
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,840
and that's why I also really love what
you guys are doing

198
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,120
and now,

199
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,760
anything that you provide

200
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,440
value to the end user, that's

201
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,960
something we get every day,
sometimes five, sometimes 10 these days,

202
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,400
many more than that

203
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,560
e-mails from people,

204
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,760
I see what you're sharing

205
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,120
change or stage of their lives

206
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,720
this is really the big joy

207
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,600
of coming to work here

208
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,200
a lot of companies try to bring value,
but when you

209
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,320
do that in such a direct way

210
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,840
ou actually change something very
fundamental in someone's

211
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,560
life as someone like that.

212
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,120
that's really amazing

213
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,320
and that keeps us very motivated every day

214
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,000
I mean, Alon, you can literally fill up
your whole

215
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,680
wall with tweets of better help save my life

216
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,640
I see that every day on Facebook,
that's done that Really?

217
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,040
I don't see that about many
companies that term

218
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,200
something saved my life

219
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,600
you know, something made me happier or
something was tasty

220
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,840
something helped me enjoy movies better,
but something saved my life

221
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,280
I think that's pretty special

222
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,320
now we're in April where hopefully

223
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,360
soon at the peak of Corona

224
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,000
and how is this how is this affecting
better help?

225
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,640
what's happening to

226
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,240
the therapy world where

227
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,920
now all therapists have to move online, basically

228
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,720
so we see several things happening

229
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,120
first of all, are existing members

230
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,880
the people that's been in therapy
with us maybe

231
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,480
for months and some of them even years,
definitely use a service warning

232
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,280
you see that in the data, our model,

233
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,120
we mentioned that better models, really,

234
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,800
the consumer is paying a flat fee, a
monthly fee

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,480
and with that fee, they can interact with
the counselors as much as they like

236
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,560
over text and messages as they need

237
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,960
and they can have a weekly live session
of a fun video chat

238
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,560
so it's kind of a flexible model that

239
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,080
use the service more or less as need

240
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,640
without worrying on the financials of a
specific session

241
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,320
so we see a lot of people just use the
service more

242
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,440
Right

243
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,040
and we're very happy that we can help
them this time

244
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,800
we also have an influx of a lot of new
members

245
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,560
the number of new people that sign up
with us

246
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,760
and so therapy with us has doubled

247
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,520
these February-March to specific

248
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,240
people with stress and anxiety,

249
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,440
which are things that are relevant to
Corona virus

250
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,000
double then compared to a February March
of last year

251
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,220
so that's also destined to to the great in

252
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,480
unlike maybe other

253
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,200
verticals where you have a problem

254
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,720
of the months sucking up supply cannot

255
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,760
accommodate that or you have more
supply Now that demand in

256
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,960
you know artists specifically

257
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,640
for this crisis is actually played

258
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,280
out pretty well because

259
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,920
a lot more people need therapy, but also
a lot of therapists are now available to provide

260
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,000
more services

261
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,720
so we see, firstly we see a lot more patients of
therapist who wants to work with us,

262
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,640
but also the current therapists

263
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,000
are opening their availability more
because we have a lot of therapies

264
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,200
I just think Better Help have a
private practice to work in a school,

265
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,040
in an agency

266
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,920
and of course, now everything is
very different

267
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,440
so, yes, we have a lot more demand,

268
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,560
but also supply

269
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,720
improved significantly

270
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,280
so we're we're pretty,

271
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,360
pretty in good shape to accommodate an
ease of both sides of.

272
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,040
Yeah, I mean, you know, every second
article that I read is about

273
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,680
how tech startups are firing

274
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,120
vehemently across the board

275
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,800
and then I go on Facebook and Alon Matas

276
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,800
we're hiring aggressively

277
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,340
please refer to us

278
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,480
I think over the last week we hired like
six people,

279
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,560
in the company of how many?

280
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,280
in the company of how many people?

281
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,860
at Better Help 70 or maybe I don't know, 75

282
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,760
so you increased by almost 10 %

283
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,120
Yeah

284
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,080
now everybody is talking percentages
Yeah. and we also tried to make it to meet

285
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,960
the people who are infected now

286
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,160
so for example, one of the

287
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,640
maybe bigger startups and so-called I'm
sure now

288
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,720
a mass layoff

289
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,640
last week, we made a webinar

290
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,200
a couple days ago with a whole
department that

291
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,040
just got shut down and offered

292
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,640
all of them to start a Fast-Track
process

293
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,320
because we know an , for me like I

294
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,640
want to come across is someone taking
advantage of the situation

295
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,520
but for all for us, you know, always
wanting

296
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,240
now you interview someone

297
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,360
and they look great and they have all
the qualifications and everything

298
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,480
you always having at the back of your mind

299
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,080
OK, so what? Why do

300
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,120
you leave your previous workplace or
why were you let go?

301
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,600
and that's always kind of a sticking point

302
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,880
I need to understand the story

303
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:01,800
here

304
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,360
it's actually very simple

305
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,760
Yeah, my department got shut down

306
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,520
it's a great starting to get company even
over hours

307
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,560
so is it awesome? I mean,

308
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,840
it's it's terrible

309
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,720
but they're now they're kicking people
looking for a job

310
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,280
and the fact is, looking for a job has
nothing to

311
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,840
do with her performance
Yeah.

312
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,080
or they could please just situational

313
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,640
interesting
I kind of assume that they are top

314
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,400
performers because they were in
their own startup

315
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,240
so we'll still make an interview process
and we'll

316
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,360
make some hiring process

317
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,000
but it's a much more faster thing to do
with a lot

318
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,200
more confidence with your situation

319
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,300
so what's going to happen a year from now?
A you know, I'm looking at people having

320
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,840
weddings over zoom, funerals over zoom and

321
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,440
let alone so therapy obviously, what's
going to happen in

322
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,360
a year with online relationships and
communication.

323
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,960
you know, I just started planning my

324
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,000
eleven year old birthday present today

325
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,200
it's a good thing it's not a bar mitzvah.

326
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,760
You know, you have a year like day.

327
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,460
I don't know, like I don't have a
crystal ball thinking a lot of

328
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,000
I think and in this week, I don't know when this
is going to be in this week.

329
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,240
I think there is a

330
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,840
some kind of sudden realization

331
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,360
that this is not a binary situation
where it

332
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,960
will just, you know, we're now shut down

333
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,080
in the announcement of a moment

334
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,620
we'll go back to normal.

335
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,320
now people starting to realize that it's
going

336
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,160
probably going to be a gradual process

337
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,400
with a lot of checks and balances and
ups and downs

338
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,440
and pullbacks and restrictions

339
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,320
and that's open and actually opening up a
lot of questions

340
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,440
of how things are going to look like

341
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,800
I don't think, you know, face to face is
doomed forever

342
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,840
I think we'll definitely go back to that
and that's great

343
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,440
I think online is but definitely
should

344
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,240
be the path of a space for some people
that feel more comfortable

345
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,560
some patients are also best addressed with
a space

346
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,280
also, refer people in normal times

347
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,920
a pretty significant percent, people who

348
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,960
sign up to Better Help and tell them
actually only counseling is not

349
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,000
a great fit for you or your situation,
or maybe your severity

350
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,320
you should go face to face and we provide
referrals and resources

351
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,120
so it should definitely be back and
should be back

352
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,760
but I think a lot of people

353
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,480
just like with, you know

354
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,280
web conferencing and doing meeting
online and

355
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,960
working remotely

356
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,680
were forced to experience other things and

357
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,400
find out that, you know what, that's
actually works

358
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,080
pretty well better than I expected

359
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,720
so I think if if we prove that we

360
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,320
can provide the quality of service that

361
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,920
people expect and get in traditional

362
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,760
format, then it's definitely going to
have a long

363
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,120
term and impact on the US

364
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,880
but are we are we doomed to

365
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,360
go full virtual?

366
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,600
so I'm thinking about, you know, my
generation, the one after me

367
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,800
and I mean, if we look at it in 20 years,

368
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,320
do you really I mean, I'm looking at you

369
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,920
as an expert on virtual relationship,

370
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,440
Right, virtual communication and, you
know, therapy

371
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,240
you could suggest that it's one of the
most intimate relationships

372
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,080
that you could form with another with a
person, let alone a professional

373
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,000
and you're showing that it's possible and

374
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,360
can still be adequate, well virtual

375
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:39,600
so do you think  that's where we're headed worse
at some point we're just gonna take

376
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,560
it for granted that everything is
virtual and doing this physically

377
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,760
will be kind of a weird and out of the norm?

378
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,480
twenty years is a long, long time

379
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,120
you can look at what happened with retail

380
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,760
retailers that only suffered a lot with

381
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,520
the rise of online

382
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,480
and Amazon and e-retailers,

383
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,120
but it still exists in

384
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,040
still a huge portion of

385
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,240
commerce is done in physical retail

386
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,640
I think it's

387
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,600
always going to have to have both

388
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,480
maybe not in the same proportion we have now

389
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,320
and of course, it's up to us to prove that

390
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,080
it works in now

391
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,600
you know, when we started six years ago,
it was a theory

392
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,040
and then we started getting feedback from
users and counselors

393
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,040
but it was always kind of,
that's really how the

394
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,840
simple equal outcomes over the last
couple of years,

395
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,360
more and more studies and more and more
research

396
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,920
started to come specifically following

397
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,480
counts to give more specific help with some

398
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,200
studies that showed

399
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,840
that for some areas, for example,

400
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,680
depression, the very clinical outcomes,

401
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,360
not how people feel, not what people say

402
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,280
The way you can measure their depression
symptoms, the

403
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,080
improved the reduction in these symptoms
is somewhat increasing

404
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,240
online counseling with platform like Better Help

405
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,080
compared to traditional counseling

406
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,400
so as this get more acceptable by people

407
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,640
in more back by my research

408
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,800
that's definitely going to help you

409
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,960
but I'm not I don't think I can actually

410
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,600
predict what happens

411
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,520
at 20 years from now,

412
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,080
but I don't think we're going to be 100% virtual
Yeah

413
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,040
even in this time

414
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,200
Alon before we end,

415
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,000
Three words that describe you

416
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,700
well,

417
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,760
that's the reaction
Yeah

418
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,280
You should've prepared me for that

419
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,000
but then I to get that reaction

420
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,200
three words, they has to be three adjectives or,

421
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,360
whatever you come up with

422
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,960
it's not a commandment

423
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,600
three words that you feel now

424
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,680
trying my best

425
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,680
love it

426
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,600
I might adopt that I really like it

427
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,700
Alon thank you so much for your time

428
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,720
thank you
there's a lot of fun

429
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,520
Bye bye
