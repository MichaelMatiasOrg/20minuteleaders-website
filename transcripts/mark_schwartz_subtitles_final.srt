54
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,000
Wonderful.

55
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,760
Mark Schwartz, so great to have you

56
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,560
on 20 Minute Leaders.

57
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,520
Thank you so much.

58
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,200
My pleasure.

59
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,240
Happy to be here.

60
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,920
This is gonna be so much fun.

61
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,600
I'm so excited for the next 20 minutes

62
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,760
because we're gonna talk about

63
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,560
how you were on the board of directors

64
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,240
of Starbucks and you helped them raise

65
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,880
their first institutional funding.

66
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,440
We're gonna talk about firing

67
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,080
without adverse consequences,

68
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,080
In class, you teach at Claremont

69
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,480
if I'm not mistaken.

70
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,760
So, you did Harvard MBA.

71
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,240
You went to Claremont before.

72
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,520
And I'm really, really excited.

73
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,120
Let's start off back in the day,

74
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,240
we're at Starbucks

75
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,400
and you're getting involved.

76
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,240
So, the process of helping Starbucks

77
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,920
raise capital was not an easy one

78
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,280
in many perspectives.

79
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,680
It was difficult internally

80
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,400
at my investment banking firm

81
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,720
Donaldson, Lufkin, Jenrette.

82
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,120
I remember going to banking review

83
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,920
for approval of the deal.

84
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,720
Taking a red eye.

85
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,120
And there was this one person

86
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,200
on the committee

87
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,680
who couldn't understand

88
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,240
why anybody would pay

89
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,680
a dollar for a cup of coffee.

90
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,280
And he looked at the first page

91
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,720
of the book and used the F bomb word maybe,

92
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,360
I don't know, 30 times.

93
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,120
"Who's gonna pay an f-ing dollar

94
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,880
for an f-ing cup of coffee"

95
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,520
Yada yada yada.

96
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,160
And I turned to my colleague and said,

97
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,000
"Who's gonna tell him it's a dollar fifty?"

98
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,600
And basically, I managed to

99
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,080
walk into Tony James' office,

100
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,160
who's the vice chair of Blackstone,

101
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,680
and told him that,

102
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,320
"Look, Tony,

103
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,800
you're on the board of Costco

104
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,920
and Jeff Rottman

105
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,880
is mentoring Howard Schultz.

106
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,160
It's 6:30 in the morning out there.

107
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,840
Call him and tell him we're

108
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,680
not gonna do the deal."

109
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,320
And Tony said,

110
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,200
"Okay, just get the deal done."

111
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,000
And I said,

112
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,280
"What about banking review?"

113
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,000
And he said, "You just had it."

114
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,680
And then the other issue was

115
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,400
the company had just opened

116
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,000
its first store in Chicago,

117
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,640
which was out of the Pacific Northwest.

118
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,640
And it wasn't going well.

119
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,880
And the key learning and lesson

120
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,720
from opening new stores in a new territory

121
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,360
is just like the expression,

122
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,480
"All politics is local"

123
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,080
It can be said that all retail is local.

124
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,240
And so the consumer behavior

125
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,880
in Seattle wasn't necessarily the same

126
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,960
as the consumer behavior in Chicago.

127
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,880
People didn't stop in the winter

128
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,000
in Chicago

129
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
even though 400,000 people

130
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,480
walked in front of the store.

131
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,080
And ultimately

132
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,360
they closed the store.

133
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,520
Wow.

134
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,760
We did get the funding done.

135
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,360
We actually raised 30% more

136
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,400
than we were going out for.

137
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,280
Probably could have done

138
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,360
even more than that.

139
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,680
We did it at a slight discount

140
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,880
to our offer price,

141
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,200
but the good news is we raised more capital

142
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,960
than we needed and we got the deal done.

143
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,440
And I think the most important issue

144
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,400
in raising capital at any stage

145
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,040
is getting the capital.

146
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,360
It doesn't matter.

147
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,640
It's pretty binary,

148
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,880
either you got the money

149
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,360
or you didn't.

150
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,200
And so we were able to get

151
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,440
the money and move forward.

152
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,440
And then I got to serve on the board,

153
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,560
which was a fascinating experience because

154
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,280
I was a young investment banker

155
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,800
and I learned

156
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,520
more than I contributed.

157
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,760
Mark, unbelievable.

158
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,920
Did realize, did you have the slightest understanding

159
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,400
that Starbucks is going to become

160
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,000
what it is today?

161
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,190
I knew that Howard Schultz

162
00:05:34,195 --> 00:05:37,200
was a unique executive

163
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,480
and entrepreneur,

164
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,240
even though a lot of people

165
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,080
couldn't see that.

166
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,280
I think he had a certain charisma

167
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,240
and a passion that was rare.

168
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,200
So, I think eventually

169
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:01,040
it would be successful.

170
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,360
You know they, it wasn't always great success,

171
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,080
but I think he was an

172
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,000
unbelievable student.

173
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,880
And one ... people on his team,

174
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,280
and was just fearless

175
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,020
about going after something.

176
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,440
Amazing. Amazing.

177
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,720
Okay. Mark, So, I want you

178
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,000
to take me a little bit

179
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,040
throughout your different ...

180
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,400
because you also co-founded

181
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,720
the largest US-Hispanic supermarket.

182
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,200
And you are now teaching class about

183
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:32,920
how to fire

184
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,160
without adverse consequences.

185
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,480
So, tell me a little bit about your life,

186
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,400
about what drives you and your passion.

187
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,880
And then let's move on to firing

188
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,960
because it sounds like something

189
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,080
that every CEO needs to really hone.

190
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
And it's a lesson that

191
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,920
I'm gonna have to learn

192
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,600
either the hard way or the easy way.

193
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,640
I'm gonna choose the easy way

194
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,360
through this talk.

195
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,320
So, it was through the Starbucks connection

196
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,960
that I got introduced to somebody

197
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,280
who became my partner

198
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,840
in founding Bodega Latina,

199
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,840
the Hispanic supermarket company.

200
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,760
Jamie Shannon introduced me to Al Lujan

201
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:15,280
and we worked kind of as a side gig on this.

202
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,160
And then when it was getting

203
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,760
very difficult to have

204
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,960
fundraising meetings

205
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,080
only in the evenings and on weekends

206
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,200
sneaking a few in

207
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,000
I decided to take the big plunge.

208
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,360
I was definitely inspired

209
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,960
by Howard Schultz in my own

210
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,440
entrepreneurial journey.

211
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,120
I think the training I got

212
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,320
in investment banking was excellent,

213
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,800
but there was something about

214
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,520
being an entrepreneur that was liberating,

215
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,720
and that was a great experience

216
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:53,760
that I think I really wanted to have.

217
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,000
Right. So, you didn't just have

218
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,360
an entrepreneurial experience,

219
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,880
but you've co-founded,

220
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:00,600
you co-founded

221
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,240
the largest US-Hispanic Supermarket.

222
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,200
What size did it get to

223
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,240
just to -

224
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,400
Over three billion in revenue.

225
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,200
Easy. Just three billion.

226
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,560
Just another

227
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,320
entrepreneurial experience.

228
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,600
But Mark, most importantly,

229
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,160
let's jump into this firing

230
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,960
without adverse consequences.

231
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,960
What is that about?

232
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,680
Why are you teaching a class

233
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,640
in entrepreneurial finance about

234
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,160
firing without consequences?

235
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,160
So at my alma mater,

236
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,720
Claremont McKenna College,

237
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,000
I serve on the board of

238
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,920
The Center for Innovation

239
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,040
and Entrepreneurship.

240
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,120
And often at meetings,

241
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,600
students would come in and pitch us

242
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,840
for funding for their business

243
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,360
or their app, as I would call it.

244
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,840
And to sort of defuse -

245
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,280
By the way, when did it transition

246
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,280
from business to app?

247
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,520
How long ago?

248
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,760
In most cases, it never did in my mind.

249
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,840
I got an app and I want money.

250
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,960
Yup.

251
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,080
Okay, do you have a business?

252
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,640
So, oftentimes what I would do,

253
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,960
these were students and they're

254
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,640
19, 20, 21 years old

255
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,080
and they were good

256
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,600
at creating an app,

257
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,000
but I don't know that they had any idea

258
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,480
or concept of managing a business

259
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,640
and building a team, etc.

260
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,680
So I would use this question

261
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,760
as a way of sort of

262
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,880
really kind of separating

263
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,080
wheat from the chaff.

264
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,280
I'd say, "Tell me about the last two

265
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,240
people that you fired and how that went."

266
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,360
And I get a deer in the headlights response.

267
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,520
Oh, don't worry.

268
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,400
You probably took that course in college.

269
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,040
And again,

270
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,520
there isn't that course

271
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,240
so you couldn't have taken it.

272
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,560
And I did this a couple of times.

273
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,360
And then I think the tipping point for me was

274
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,680
a company that I had invested in

275
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,240
and a founder that I was mentoring,

276
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,600
sent me an e-mail saying,

277
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,960
on a Friday afternoon, saying,

278
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,040
"I'm thinking of firing my co-founder.

279
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,880
Do you have any tips?"

280
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,880
And I thought that was such

281
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,240
a broad expansive question.

282
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,680
It's like I want to be an entrepreneur.

283
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,640
Do you have any ideas of a business

284
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,280
that I could be the founder of?

285
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,640
I like the analogy. Yeah

286
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,480
And so what I did was

287
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,280
I put together kind of a resource

288
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,480
based upon my own education.

289
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,520
So I, too, did not take that course.

290
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,600
I went to the school of hard knocks

291
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,080
and learned it the hard way

292
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,800
by being on the other end

293
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,720
of a bunch of wrongful

294
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,240
termination lawsuits.

295
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,680
So, I put together this lecture

296
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,600
on how to fire

297
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,520
without adverse consequences.

298
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,920
And then ultimately I repurposed it

299
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,800
for a school of nonprofit management.

300
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,280
And I wrote a case study

301
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,160
based upon a nonprofit organization

302
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,720
that I was involved with,

303
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,160
and the firing of the executive director

304
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,360
and changed the names

305
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,880
so it would be fictitious.

306
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,760
Right.

307
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,920
And a couple of the key takeaways

308
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
from that.

309
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,240
First of all,

310
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,440
again, all politics is local.

311
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,040
All employment law is state specific.

312
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,680
So, you have to know the laws

313
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,440
in the state in which you are operating

314
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,160
and the state in which you have nexus -

315
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,920
Which today is kind of almost impossible

316
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,160
as you have employees scattered

317
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,320
all across the US,

318
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,440
let alone all across the world.

319
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,680
And we're just transitioning

320
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,360
to accelerate to even more of that.

321
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,160
Right?

322
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,920
Right. But ultimately

323
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,640
where the company is headquartered

324
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,800
and is more than likely to be

325
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,600
the domicile of where the state law applies,

326
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,600
regardless of where the employee

327
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,520
is physically located.

328
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,200
Right.

329
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,840
But it is a legal process

330
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,280
and the law changes.

331
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,000
So, you need to have

332
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,000
the expertise of an employment lawyer.

333
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,680
And the second thing is

334
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,760
when you go into

335
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,640
the termination agreement process,

336
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,120
I say you need to do at least two things.

337
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,360
One, you should be scripted.

338
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,880
So that it very apparent that you

339
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,440
are reading from a script.

340
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,280
And there isn't any deviation.

341
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,480
And second of all, you want to have

342
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,360
a witness on your side

343
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,480
so it becomes a two on one.

344
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,160
Okay. I wanna dive deeper

345
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,040
into these two things.

346
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,160
I'm picking up my computer

347
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,760
because it's making some funky noises.

348
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,920
So I'm taking care of in the meantime.

349
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,520
But you're saying two on one.

350
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,200
I mean, I'm thinking about myself

351
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,880
coming in to a termination room

352
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,080
where I'm about to be terminated

353
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,200
and I have two people

354
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,440
reading out a script to me.

355
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,160
That doesn't feel very personal.

356
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,480
It doesn't feel like they

357
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,640
care about me too much.

358
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,480
It's actually designed to minimize

359
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,920
the litigation fallout.

360
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,080
Okay.

361
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,840
And as the employer,

362
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,760
that's what you're concern.

363
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,160
What am I doing in order to prevent

364
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,960
the wrongful termination lawsuit?

365
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,360
Right.

366
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,160
And all of the

367
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,360
issues that you're talking about

368
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,160
are dealt with prior to this.

369
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,040
You know, I look at firing

370
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,840
as a mutual liberation.

371
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,440
Some employee is not living up

372
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,200
to their highest and best potential

373
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,360
in this organization.

374
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:13,160
You are doing them a career favor

375
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,240
by parting ways

376
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,520
because you don't want them

377
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,400
to be a sub-optimal

378
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,360
or sub-performer

379
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,960
when they could very well be

380
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,480
much better in a different environment,

381
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,600
in a different job,

382
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,280
depending upon the circumstances.

383
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,080
And then you don't want to have

384
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,680
the sort of nasty,

385
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,800
periodic performance reviews that

386
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,400
basically don't do anything but cast

387
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,720
a pall of doubt on employees.

388
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,760
So, in some ways termination

389
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,360
is the human way to end suffering

390
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,240
on both parts -

391
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,440
I mean it sounds very very rational

392
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,280
when you put it that way,

393
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,560
but is it also

394
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,280
the responsible of the CEO

395
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,240
or whoever is managing the termination

396
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,160
to make that clear?

397
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,360
Because right now

398
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,760
especially as we saw in covid,

399
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,360
a lot of large corporations,

400
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,640
the way that they dealt

401
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,480
with their termination,

402
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,440
and that's what's in the back of my mind,

403
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,840
there was a whole variety

404
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
on the whole spectrum of how

405
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,240
you deal with termination.

406
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,200
A lot of them were accused

407
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,480
of wrongful termination.

408
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,240
A lot of them were praised

409
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,160
for their termination tactics.

410
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,280
So, what's your take on that?

411
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,040
So, every situation is different

412
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,480
and the law is different

413
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,880
depending upon the circumstances.

414
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,560
Most of what you're talking about

415
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,080
during covid-19 would likely fall under

416
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,560
what's called a reduction in force.

417
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,680
Okay.

418
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,520
Some of it was a furlough where

419
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,760
they were still getting benefits,

420
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,320
but they weren't getting any salary.

421
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,680
Right.

422
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,480
You know, I'm talking about

423
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,440
a individual who's not performing

424
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,680
and you've taken a lot of necessary steps

425
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,960
to try and improve that

426
00:16:08,965 --> 00:16:12,640
performance, performance improvement plan.

427
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,160
And it's very clear

428
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,320
it's just not working.

429
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,520
You know, my experience is,

430
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,000
when it comes to firing or terminating,

431
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:35,120
you want to fire fast and hire slow.

432
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,040
Most companies flip it around.

433
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,680
They take forever to hire someone

434
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,240
and the firing

435
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
I'm sorry.

436
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,080
They're very quick to hire -

437
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,080
They hire everybody and they fire slowly.

438
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,560
Right. Right.

439
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,960
And then they're slow to fire.

440
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,120
You want that,

441
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,160
what I say is,

442
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,680
When do you know it's time

443
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,270
to terminate someone?

444
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,160
30 days before you got the first notion

445
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,590
in your mind.

446
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,030
It's sort of like, in

447
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,440
in my experience,

448
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,070
it doesn't get better.

449
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,310
It drags on.

450
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,790
It gets worse.

451
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Wait a minute. How many of these

452
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,790
have you been involved with?

453
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,560
If you could just estimate

454
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,400
over your career how many firing dilemmas,

455
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,310
situations were you somewhat of a part in?

456
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,750
Oh, probably dozens

457
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,350
where I directly went in and handled

458
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,750
the termination and so on.

459
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,560
So, you've seen it all.

460
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,510
You've seen the good, the bad, the ugly.

461
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,920
Okay. Wow.

462
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,680
Is there a specific occurrence that

463
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,080
sort of like light switch

464
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,119
went up went off and said, "Wow."

465
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,200
Like there are lessons to be learned

466
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,760
about firing when you are

467
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,440
giving it so much weight?

468
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,520
Yeah, definitely.

469
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,040
I mean, if you've been through

470
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,320
a wrongful termination lawsuit

471
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,840
and see how much time and expense

472
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,800
can be taken to patch together

473
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,590
a termination that didn't work out,

474
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,920
you kind of realize that this is an ugly side of business

475
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,080
and you want to avoid this

476
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,270
as much as possible.

477
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,400
I'm sure. I'm sure.

478
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,440
Mark, I'm going into my own journey now.

479
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,160
My own entrepreneurial journey.

480
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,040
I could only wish for myself

481
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,440
that I get half of the incredible

482
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,830
experiences that you've had.

483
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,280
And we didn't even mention that right now

484
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,600
you're still sitting on

485
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,120
quite a few boards, right?

486
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,320
On incredible companies.

487
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,200
One of them is 129 year old

488
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,680
pharmaceutical company.

489
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,200
A pharmaceutical retailer in Seattle,

490
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,900
Bartell Drugs. Yes.

491
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,480
It's older than Nordstrom's

492
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,960
and General Electric.

493
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,160
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

494
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,350
So, you're still very, very active,

495
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,200
but I want to use the last minute to get

496
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,480
one or two key pieces of advice

497
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,360
that you would have for me

498
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,240
as I'm entering my entrepreneurial journey.

499
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,200
So, I would talk about

500
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,400
finance and raising capital.

501
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,240
And I think one of the most

502
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,480
important lessons I learned the hard way

503
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,920
from my own entrepreneurial journey

504
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,040
and what I try to impart to entrepreneurs

505
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,400
as either an investor or a mentor or adviser

506
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,590
is make sure you raise enough capital.

507
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,640
And so in my Hispanic supermarket company,

508
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,440
we didn't raise enough capital

509
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,510
in our first round of financing.

510
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,920
And I thought

511
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,120
we were going to be able to

512
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,830
secure some equipment leasing or

513
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,920
equipment financing for the store,

514
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:55,040
and we weren't a credit worthy tenant

515
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,000
or borrower to be able to do that.

516
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,830
And we required the personal guarantees

517
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,830
of all of the investors.

518
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,400
Had we raised enough capital so we could have

519
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,040
just purchased it outright

520
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,760
and not had to finance it,

521
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,640
we would have been

522
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,270
in much better shape.

523
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,120
And as a result of that experience,

524
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,510
myself and my co-founder,

525
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,350
lost some of our equity

526
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,270
when we sold the business

527
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,510
and we had our liquidity event.

528
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,070
That equity was worth

529
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,030
a substantial amount.

530
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,160
And it just reinforced the issue,

531
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,400
if we had raised more money,

532
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,640
we might have had some of that equity.

533
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,080
Very very fascinating.

534
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,560
Mark, right before we leave,

535
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,600
I wanna thank you again for all this inspiration.

536
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,160
And I look forward

537
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,320
to maintaining this relationship

538
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,880
and continuing to get advice from you

539
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,640
definitely when I start my own company.

540
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,750
I have it sounds like I have an infinite to learn.

541
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,880
But before we leave,

542
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,080
I need three words from you

543
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,800
that best describe you.

544
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:06,350
I'm a finance and operationally oriented

545
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,720
entrepreneur and board member.

546
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,960
And what?

547
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,790
And board member.

548
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,680
Wonderful.

549
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,520
Mark, toda raba.

550
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,070
Thank you very very much.

551
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,030
Have a great day and shabbat shalom.

552
00:21:18,031 --> 00:21:19,370
Shabbat shalom.

553
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,280
And thank you, Michael, very much.

554
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,320
It was a pleasure and good luck to you

555
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,830
and your entrepreneurial journey.

556
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,270
Thank you.

557
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,680
And we didn't even get a chance to talk about

558
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,120
how we're both at J-Ventures

559
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,360
and how much fun I've been having there

560
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,560
and your amazing contributions to the fund.

561
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,510
So, thank you for that, too.

562
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,070
Of course.

563
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,790
And say hello to our friend Odet.

564
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,110
I definitely will. Thank you.

565
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,030
Take care, Mark.

566
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,200
Take care. Bye now.

567
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,640
Bye bye.
