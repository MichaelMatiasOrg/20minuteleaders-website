1 I can tell you that for me, I try to really balance both because I'm kind of a nerd. So it's important for me to put the effort. Maya Avni, thank you so much for being on my show. How are you? I'm good, Michael. So great being here. Well, obviously, you're good because you're at the GSB right behind you now. You're not actually outside in front of the GSB, but you are in very close proximity, right? Yeah, that's true. I'm on campus right now. Actually, I live here, so it's really, really nice. It is, though, sunny, as you can see in the picture. So, I like it. It is. It's beautiful. Actually, I think this episode is likely, I think it airs in about December. So, I'll be getting ready to come back to campus. But you've had the privilege of being on campus throughout a lot of this covid situation. So, I'd love to both talk about your journey going from 8200 to different startups, as QA to Google, and now most recently, Stanford Graduate School of Business. But I'm particularly interested to hear about how you've dealt with covid as part of this incredible business school program and what the GSB is all about anyways. Maya, take me back. First of all, who is Maya all the way back to the 8200 days? And how do you go about this path to end up at the GSB? Wow. Okay, so that's a lot. So, let's start and if you want to stop me, just feel free obviously. So, I think, actually, maybe I can start even from my high school. At high school I was a dancer actually, which is pretty far away from everything that I'm doing today. I loved it very much. And then when it was time to get to go to the army, like everyone in Israel, when you get to the age of 18, you have to go to the army I really wanted to do something super meaningful. So, I decided to drop my dancing kind of path and I went to 8200. 8200 for me was the first time that I fell in love with technology. This is how I see it. First time that you are exposed in very young age to really some crazy things that we can do thanks to technology. I spend there three years and I really knew that whatever I'm going to do next is going to be around technology. I didn't know what it was going to be, but I knew technology will definitely be part of my life going forward. Amazing. Yeah, and then after that I did like, like every Israeli I went to Central America. Did a few months there, like clean my head, thought about what I wanted to do. When I came back, I decided to start engineering in Tel Aviv University. And while I was doing my engineering degree, I started working at Google. And that was like a very meaningful stop in my way. I spent there six years. I absolutely love the company. And after six years, I felt like there are a lot of things out there that I don't know and I'm not really sure how I'm going to explore those things. And then I started to think about doing an MBA. By the way, I do want to mention here, because this is a little bit divergent from what a lot of people around the world experience. Because usually when you go to college and you study whatever it may be, you don't go and work full time at a company, especially on a company like Google while you're studying in. And it's well, it's a little bit different. You go to the army, you spend quite a few years in the army, whether it's two, all the way to some people, six. And then by the time that you go to college, you're mature enough to both handle a full degree, which is extremely intensive through your program in Israel, along with a full time job for only four years if you're doing the engineering and juggling Google. So, I think that's amazing. Yeah. So, I started working at Google at my second year of the university. So, it was really challenging. But I can say that Google is such an amazing place in the sense that, like, my first conversation with my manager was: okay, we want to keep you like the top of your class. So it's very, very important for us that you keep putting the effort that you need in university and whatever you need. So, that was really amazing to kind of combine the both. Sure. So, talk to me about this how do you think about going through an MBA? Because you're spending six years at Google, you're doing really amazing work there. I saw you quite a few times at Google for Startups Building just in the months leading up to Stanford. But what makes you want to go do an MBA, stop your career wherever it may be, and go become a student again? Yeah, I mean, I think the first question that a lot of people ask themselves is whether or not MBA really worth it. You know, it's exactly how you said. You take two years break from everything you're doing in your life, like the opportunity cost here is so big. You're losing two years of salary. You're losing two years of maybe promotions and what you're going to do next. And a lot of people feel like maybe it's not the best choice. Like it really depends on who you ask. And I totally get that to be honest. You need to sacrifice a lot. But then again, you have to ask yourself why you want to do it and why you actually are doing that. And I think that for me, the answer was, first of all, as I started to say, I wanted to explore more options. Here at Stanford, I think about everything that I did last year. I'm now on my second year. So I think about everything that I did last year. Where in my life would I have so many opportunities just kind of squeezed into this one year that I think about all the things that I did last year. Experience in a VC, in different tech companies, in products, and things that I never did before. So, for me, first of all, it was like a safe space to explore other things that I've never done. So, that was first. The second thing that I think is even more important is thinking for the long term. And this is like the main reason why I'm here, because thinking for the long term, I think about who am I, as like, first of all, employee. But after that is also maybe a leader, a manager. What do I bring to the table. And I think that in terms of my skill set, I really wanted to make sure that I have like a very diverse skill set. And I wanted to make sure that when I want to be like a manager, maybe a founder going forward, I bring to the table valuable stuff. Both in terms of skill set, but also who am I as a person, what my values are. And Stanford is a lot about the values and who you are as a leader. What kind of things are important for you, what kind of thing you want to push forward. And I think that the last thing that kind of brought me here was the community. In a second, you are part of this amazing community of like the best people here in Silicon Valley. The Israelis are like a very nice group that we all know each other. So, Maya, I have to ask you, I have a few short questions and answers. Because I think that it's really, it's incredibly important to understand the context of what a business school environment is like. I did not go to business school myself, not yet at least. But I did get to experience from the side and just hanging out with you around campus, because especially at Stanford, it's like all intertwined. We sometimes go to the same classes. I believe that you took a class recently with my girlfriend, right? And she's in graduate school. So, quickly, who is the type of person that you would find at the GSB? Give me some high level characteristics. What are they like? You'll find all types of people, really, but the best ones. And what that does mean? Is that the most hard working, the most humble, the nicest? What does it mean, the best people? I think, yeah, the most humble. I don't know if the most humble, but definitely people around here are very humble. All of the things that you say are like everyone is coming from a very different background. Having like a different background, I mean, both industries, but also from everywhere in the world. So, yeah, a lot of hardworking people doing their best, you know, to excel and be the best in everything that they're doing. But also there is a huge emphasis of what kind of person you are and like being good people, being good friend. What kind of values are important for you. These are things that we talk a lot about here. And actually, you know one of my impressions by meeting a lot of the people in your cohort is that every single person is a leader in their community. And when you say the best people, what I'm thinking to mind is whatever your circumstances were, you made the most out of it and beyond, and you've excelled in your circumstances. You've helped improve the lives of others. Talk to me. So, you mentioned being good people and being in touch with yourself. Touchy feely. I heard about that class from so many different people. Why is this a good representation of what the GSB encompasses? So, touchy feely, the official name of the class is interpersonal dynamics. I'm just taking the class right now, this quarter. And yeah, it is a very special class. You spend a lot of hours per week with a very small group of people, and basically it's kind of a safe place to work on your communication skills, and how do people feel about specific actions that you're doing. And it helps you understand what kind of message you deliver to the other side and maybe how can you improve and be more efficient in the things that you wanted to say and how you're saying that. It's actually really interesting because all the alums, these early alums at least that I met like a year ago, even some that graduated like 20 years ago, all of them are saying that this was like the most meaningful experience for them from the GSB. So, yeah, so I'm doing it right now. So, maybe we can speak like in a few weeks to see whether or not it's the case for me. I guess it will be. So in a higher level, you're thinking about graduate school of Business at Stanford and all of sudden you have a class which is all about working on your personal skills. And, you know, people call it touchy feely. And it sounds to me like, you know, my perception of the business school up until now was you're coming, you're learning how to do accounting, you're learning how to hire people, how to fire people and how to raise money. But it sounds like it's a little bit more complicated than that. What do you get out of a business school program? And this is especially, I think important because it's sort of like a black box to a lot of us in the undergraduate world. We don't really understand why would people go to do an MBA when now there's a lot of movements that are saying maybe you can just go into the business world and get those skills yourself? Yeah, that's a great question. And so I think, first of all, the beautiful thing about Stanford is from your second quarter here, you can choose electives and you can build your own schedule and kind of focus in on things that you are interested the most. So depending on what your goal are, like people are coming here wanting to be better in finance and investing. People are coming here wanting to build their own startup and learn more about entrepreneurship and VC. So it really depends on what you want, but you can get everything honestly. So, it's like one of probably, one of my advices would be to come here a little bit focused on what do you want to achieve here. Because otherwise you can really get lost in all the things that you can do here. But you can really get it all. So, there are a lot of people here that are working on their startups, taking a lot of entrepreneurship classes, meeting a lot of different VCs. You know, the guests that are coming to our classes? Now it's on Zoom. So, well, you know less. But the people that are coming to our classes are amazing. Like the people from the best VCs, entrepreneurs that did like sold one, two, three, four companies in millions of dollars can tell us all about their path. Other people that are coming from PE, private equity, and other investment background can get a lot of background about finance, accounting, all the things that you did. And everyone are putting a lot of effort also into more soft skills. So presentation skills, communication skills, role playing about having difficult conversations and stuff like that, which is like I really like this. So, it really depends on what you're interested in. But you have here everything honestly. One focus. One more question about the GSB and then, I'd love to also focus a little bit about who you are and some of the things that you're really passionate about. But first, how much do you actually work in the GSB? Like how much of it is actually doing homework, sitting down, solving problem sets, like I'm doing about 23 hours a day in the undergraduate world, versus the networking in the community? Yeah. So, once again, it's a question of who you are and what's important for you. People who came here and want to put like 100% in the academics part, can spend 20, 40 hours a week just doing homework and working for classes. Other people, I think most of the people who came here came over for the network. So,  it's really important to get to know people have coffee chats, like we have once in a while. And I can tell you that for me, I try to really balance both because I'm kind of a nerd. So,  it's important for me to put the effort and make sure that the classes that I'm taking, I'm taking very seriously because I want to take the most out of it. But also meeting new people, having coffee chat, and like having some fun with new friends and expanding my network, it's super important for me. This is maybe the main reason why I came here. So, I put a lot of effort there as well. So, Maya, a very meaningful service in the intelligence unit in the IDF. Years of experience in the field, an engineering degree, six years at Google, now very soon an MBA from Stanford. Where are you headed and what are you really passionate about? What do you really see yourself digging into it and making an impact in what field? That's such a tough question. To be honest, I'm not sure what's the answer for this question yet. I can tell you that I did my last six months, I worked as a product manager at Brex. Brex is a super cool company, FinTech company now valued at three billion dollars. [--] I believe, right? Yeah, true. Undergrads, though. They didn't graduate. But yeah. And I really enjoyed my time there. I really liked the product. It's the first time that I'm doing that. So, building something and thinking about the problem, what the users really want, thinking about the solution, how to design it, then going through the marketing stage, and how do we launch the product. I really, really enjoyed that. So, the way that I see it, I would love to do something around product. And I also really enjoyed FinTech. So, this is an area that I am passionate about. I think so many things are happening right now in this space. Innovation is just waiting to happen. This is how I feel. So, this is something that I'm very, very passionate about. But we'll see. I don't know. I want to, at least for now, just to keep the opportunities open and we'll wait and see. Right. Is there a specific experience that you've accumulated so far that you can really pinpoint them and say: this is something that that I learned a tremendous amount, something that may not be too obvious? Specifically from Brex? Either Brex or any of the other job. Because one of the things that I'm especially curious about, especially through this show, is the non-linear career pathways that people take. And like you, like many others, it's a non-linear career. It's you're moving from the IDF to studies to a corporate to a business school, and you're getting all these incredible experiences that I'm sure that when we'll do this chat again in 10 years after you've impacted millions of lives with whatever you'll do, it's always interesting for me to gather this insight from along the journey. So, what are some pivotal moments in your life that you really are going back to and thinking, wow, I'm so glad that I had that experience, even though maybe I didn't realize the value of it at that moment? I'll give you an answer that I'm not sure you're going to like, but I'll try. I think that one of the most important things that I learned that change is always positive, always. Doing a change, going outside your comfort zone, you always learn a lot. And the things that are most important to learn about are the things to understand what you really want to do, what really interests you. Not everybody knows it. Like what is the perfect job for you? Why you want to be an entrepreneur? Is it really the thing for you? Why you want to go to product? Like try to understand exactly what you're looking for, like what is your perfect role, what is your perfect company, and try to understand the why. I think these are kind of the questions that I've been asking myself a lot lately. And these are the type of questions, type of answer is more accurately that will help me shape my next step and understand what kind of job I want to do that will make me feel happy, make me feel like I have a huge impact. So, in every time that I did a change, that helped me to take another step forward to understand the answers to those questions. Amazing. Maya, I want to thank you again for being so generous with your time. I did like that answer very, very much. And I want to thank you also for being such a pivotal and important part of my journey at Stanford. So, we are countless coffee chats and your help with everything. It's warming to have such a strong Israeli society within Stanford. Like half of my professors somehow every quarter are Israeli, which is just phenomenal. But having classmates and people that I can look up to, like yourself that are helping along the journey. So, thank you for that. Before we go, I have the last question, the most important one, three words that you would use to describe yourself. That's a tough one. Okay. For me will be friend, curious, and problem-solver. You'll give me the last one as as if it was a one word. There is a hyphen in there. Exactly. Friend, curious, and problem solver. Maya, thank you very much. Toda raba. Best of luck with finishing this year at the GSB. I definitely hope to see you either in January or in March when I'm finally back on campus. And I can be in that wonderful weather. Not that it's not that bad in Tel Aviv, I have to say about the weather, but I think there is less protests on the streets of Stanford right now. But I'm looking forward to seeing you again soon. Thank you, Michael. Looking forward. Bye. Take care.
