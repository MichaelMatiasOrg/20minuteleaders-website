1
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,160
Emna Ghariani, thank you so much

2
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,080
for joining me on my

3
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,720
20 Minute Leaders show.

4
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,560
How are you?

5
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,120
Good. How are you?

6
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,800
Fantastic.

7
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,960
It's so great to have you here.

8
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,320
Some technical issues to start, but

9
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,800
that's part of the

10
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,160
virtual lifestyle that we have.

11
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,600
Unfortunately, we can't be in a studio

12
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,080
doing this face to face.

13
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,120
We'll settle for this.

14
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,240
Emna, we have so much to talk about

15
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,120
from your startup Veamly

16
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,080
all the way to digital well-being.

17
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,280
Let's start off easy

18
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,280
and then accelerate as we go along.

19
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,440
Who are you Emna Ghariani?

20
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,080
All right.

21
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,360
Wow, that's a long question.

22
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,650
So, I'm the CEO and co-founder of Veamly.

23
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,680
Veamly is a unified workspace

24
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,480
for developers.

25
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,440
Our goal is to help them focus better,

26
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,680
stay in flow, remove distractions,

27
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,400
so we give them a centralized workspace

28
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
for their non-coding apps,

29
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,640
and we give them a smart feed

30
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,080
of their conversations on top.

31
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,680
Are you referring to the fact

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,840
that there are distractions

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
when we are online?

34
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,800
Yes. So, the problem is today all of us,

35
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,680
even beyond developers,

36
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,720
when we open our laptop

37
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,600
our cortisol level is high by default,

38
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
our stress is high, our focus is down

39
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,320
just because we have

40
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,160
so many tabs open, so many apps,

41
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,360
and we get interrupted, yeah

42
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,720
We get interrupted every 11 minutes on average

43
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,040
and it takes over 20 minutes

44
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,120
to focus again.

45
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,680
So, when you think about it

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,320
we're all the time in non-focused mode,

47
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,480
and we end up staying late

48
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,840
and working over the weekend

49
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,520
and burning out

50
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,480
and we don't ... second

51
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,160
to stop and think pretty much.

52
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,080
So, that's why pretty much.

53
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,000
Now, is this new?

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,440
So is this something, if I look at the workforce 50 years ago,

55
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,360
people are working everywhere.

56
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,760
Is this a new problem that we have?

57
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,400
Absolutely.

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,520
Actually, it's funny you say that,

59
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
because I always talk about

60
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,200
the evolution of communication.

61
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
So 20 years ago,

62
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,600
50 years is a bit too far

63
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,320
we didn't have computers like we do today,

64
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,840
at least we didn't use them.

65
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,600
We didn't have computers

66
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,120
like we do today.

67
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,120
So 20 years ago, however,

68
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,240
communication used to happen

69
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,520
via one, two main channels.

70
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,800
Of course, that had a lot of issues

71
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,920
like scattered information, silo effects.

72
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,400
And in the past few years,

73
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
we've seen an explosion

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,040
of collaboration apps and work apps,

75
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,280
and now there's literally

76
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,440
an app for everything

77
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,520
and there is no streamlined process.

78
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,800
So, we are here

79
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,760
to streamline the process

80
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,800
between all these apps

81
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,400
and help people better leverage

82
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,800
and optimize their time

83
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,000
in the hope to help them

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,560
get to their work-life balance.

85
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,520
So, yeah.

86
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
But what does that even mean?

87
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,240
So, how do you go

88
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,320
and help people avoid distractions,

89
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,080
optimize their time,

90
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,080
be more productive in the moment?

91
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,880
Very good question.

92
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,880
So, for us, what we do in Veamly,

93
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,840
so it's a desktop app.

94
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,560
So, you have access

95
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,520
to all your different apps

96
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,560
and top you have your smart feed,

97
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,600
but we have a mode

98
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,560
where you can go from sync to async.

99
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,000
So, when you are in async mode

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,400
you have no interruptions.

101
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,760
You still have your smart inbox

102
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,520
being filled up

103
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,640
with all your conversations,

104
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,040
and then we have

105
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,280
a soft alert system

106
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,160
to help users understand

107
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,520
that they need to look at something,

108
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,440
but that they're in flow

109
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,000
it's not gonna interrupt them.

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,200
And then what we do

111
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,320
is we bring them awareness

112
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,440
on how they're using their time,

113
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
and we give them insights

114
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,640
to help them really

115
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,800
educate themselves better.

116
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,040
So with Veamly, they get at least

117
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,000
an hour back a day.

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,040
Wow. So, I think that's just fascinating,

119
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,120
'cause as I'm reflecting now

120
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,040
on my experience,

121
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,220
I'm a software engineer

122
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,280
at Hippo Insurance,

123
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,200
and I love the experience.

124
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,280
And one of the interesting things

125
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,240
is that I've noticed that

126
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,640
now that everybody's remote

127
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,000
and there is no casual meetings,

128
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,320
I can't stand up and go meet

129
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,400
somebody at the office,

130
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,080
my Slack messages that I'm getting

131
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,800
I almost feel the responsibility

132
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,560
of answering them

133
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,120
as if somebody came up to my desk

134
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,200
and spoke to me.

135
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,920
And that is distracting because

136
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,120
as I'm coding or doing something else,

137
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,360
I feel compelled to

138
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,000
in real time answer everybody.

139
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,320
It's not like an email

140
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,200
where I feel, okay,

141
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,600
it's fine if I take two, three hours

142
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,920
because I don't check my email

143
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,640
every five seconds, right?

144
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,840
So, I love what you're saying

145
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,040
because for me, it's very interesting

146
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,920
how we as people

147
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,840
don't even take a step back

148
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
to think on why we do that even.

149
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,200
Like Slack is not forcing us to go in.

150
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,520
But what happened is the notification sound

151
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,440
or the color ... makes your brain react

152
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,640
before yourself in a way.

153
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,360
So, that creates this fake sense of urgency

154
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,560
and this also FOMO effect, right,

155
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,600
the fear of missing out.

156
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,040
So, before you ...

157
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,120
it's one of your colleagues

158
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,600
sharing a puppy picture

159
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,602
and it's not

160
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,960
... everything is fine,

161
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,000
you're already distracted,

162
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,880
you're already looking at it,

163
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,360
you're already interacting with it.

164
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,440
Beyond that, you also have

165
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,000
your comments on your JIRA tickets

166
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,560
and your comments

167
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,440
on your ... request

168
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
and every single thing comes

169
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,080
and it's a notification

170
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,400
or it's an interruption.

171
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
And today there is no way to prioritize

172
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,280
to know what to focus on or not.

173
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,840
And it's very detrimental

174
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,760
to your focus, to your flow.

175
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,080
And it's stress

176
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,200
that we don't even feel.

177
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,400
For me, I will say this like

178
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
there's two types of stress, right?

179
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,360
And I'm not scientific or a doctor,

180
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,200
but there's the stress that you feel

181
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,680
and there's the stress that you don't feel

182
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,640
that's living everywhere in your body,

183
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,200
in your lower back,

184
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,480
in your wrists, everywhere,

185
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,880
and you don't realize it's happening.

186
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,360
And all these small things

187
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,520
contribute to it.

188
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:41,960
Sure.

189
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,200
But we're not accounting for them.

190
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,840
That's why we talk about

191
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,040
... productivity in that sense.

192
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,320
So, yeah.

193
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,680
So, what is the actual solution?

194
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,640
It's a desktop application

195
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,240
that I come in and I go into

196
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,360
this new world, this async world,

197
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,960
where now a lot of my messages

198
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,600
becoming self notifications

199
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
and smart alert systems.

200
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,480
Tell me a little bit more

201
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,240
about the experiences

202
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,280
that I'll have using that.

203
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,760
Yeah, absolutely.

204
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,400
As a developer

205
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,440
you open Veamly,

206
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,640
you have access to your Slack,

207
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,120
to your JIRA, to your GitHub.

208
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,920
Anytime you need to do

209
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,800
actual work in those,

210
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,280
you'll access them from there.

211
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,240
But on top we have

212
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,760
one single pane of glass

213
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,560
where it's prioritized for you

214
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,760
... what needs your action

215
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,000
and what needs your attention,

216
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,440
so immediately you know

217
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,320
how to prioritize your time

218
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,280
and what to address first.

219
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,760
So, everything else

220
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,120
that's not a priority right now

221
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,280
we'll put it in another tab

222
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,920
and you can go look at it later.

223
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,640
Also, the way we prioritize

224
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,400
is based on the user preferences.

225
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,000
So, as they start, they decide

226
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,960
what goes into their feed,

227
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,160
we're not here to do that.

228
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,480
But also we have obviously

229
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,360
some algorithms to help prioritize

230
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,560
that are, some of them are logical

231
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,320
some of them are smart

232
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,720
based on behavior and semantics.

233
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,120
And so, that's the first level.

234
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,880
And then on top of that,

235
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,680
they have a unified search

236
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,200
where they can search

237
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,960
for any information really easily.

238
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,920
And, as I mentioned,

239
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,940
they have this mode

240
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,280
sync versus async,

241
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,840
and when they are in async mode,

242
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,600
then we have a soft alert system

243
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,080
that doesn't interrupt them

244
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,800
if they're in flow,

245
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,000
but if they're not,

246
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,640
then it will let them know

247
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,760
there is more stuff to look at.

248
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,880
The thing is,

249
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,520
an interruption or a distraction

250
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,760
is not a bad thing.

251
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,080
... actually proven

252
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,640
it was great for creativity.

253
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,640
But it's an unplanned

254
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,200
distraction or interruption

255
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,600
is that's the one that's bad for you.

256
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,840
So for us, we help you

257
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,760
plan your distractions in a way

258
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,320
and prioritize your time

259
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,200
while streamlining

260
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,920
all your communications.

261
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,800
So, give me a little bit of context

262
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,200
and a little bit of statistics,

263
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,640
because I'm sure that that's something

264
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,280
that you've been mixing around.

265
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,760
And so, how many notifications

266
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,160
does the average developer get,

267
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,200
let's say, a day?

268
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,640
Or how much time does it waste?

269
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,000
You mentioned something earlier.

270
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,920
Very good. So people get, developers get

271
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,560
at least a hundred messages a day

272
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,440
across their different apps.

273
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,720
So, this is a combination

274
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,600
of Slack messaging.
- We're popular.

275
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,400
Yeah. And a hundred

276
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,760
is a very small number, by the way.

277
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,080
It goes by very fast.

278
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,680
So, it's a hundred messages

279
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,880
between their Slack,

280
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,320
messages between their comments

281
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,380
on JIRA tickets,

282
00:08:59,380 --> 00:08:59,920
between their comments

283
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,000
on their ... request,

284
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,240
JIRA or whatever other app

285
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,720
obviously they're using.

286
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,760
Yeah.

287
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,840
But their ticketing apps.

288
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,280
So, between those,

289
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
they spend on average

290
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,480
two minutes on each.

291
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
So, that's a total

292
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,800
of three hours and 20 minutes a day.

293
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,720
And then couple hour meeting,

294
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,880
especially in a remote world,

295
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,800
that's five hours and 20 minutes.

296
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,160
So, theoretically in an eight hour day,

297
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,640
that leaves them

298
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,840
with an hour and 40 minutes

299
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,120
of true focus time,

300
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,760
which of course does not happen.

301
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,120
Unfortunately, the developer community

302
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,280
has always been guilty of not being great

303
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,760
at their work-life balance,

304
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,280
so they tend to burn out pretty quickly.

305
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,560
They don't take days off.

306
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,080
They don't put themselves

307
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,240
at the forefront.

308
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,400
At the same time,

309
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,720
every app out there

310
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,680
that's about developers,

311
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
it's all about code.

312
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,720
It's not about product,

313
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,520
it's not about them as people.

314
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,480
So, and for us we're like,

315
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,640
we come from that background.

316
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,080
We built product, we've seen it,

317
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,680
and we want to care about them as people

318
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,560
because as they are more balanced,

319
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,880
everything else will go even better;

320
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,440
more productive, better for the company,

321
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,280
better for everybody.

322
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,720
So, and that's ...

323
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,080
How did you get started

324
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,360
with this whole idea?

325
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
So, before this, I used to run a company

326
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,520
doing CPO as a service, so

327
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,400
Chief Product Officer as a service.

328
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,640
So, I'd act like an interim CPO

329
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,080
to non-tech founders,

330
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,760
and I'd bring my team

331
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,880
of designers and engineers,

332
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,000
and then we'd build the product

333
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,760
and take it to market

334
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,640
depending on the needs of the company.

335
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,920
And that's kind of where it hit me,

336
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,440
how the way we work is broken.

337
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,520
And so, based on my background,

338
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,760
I have a lot of background

339
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,000
in process optimization

340
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,560
and communication and ops in general.

341
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,480
So, for me, it was a no brainer

342
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,280
to go after this.

343
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,000
And before that, I did help launch

344
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,560
over 40 startups as a director

345
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,880
at The Founder Institute.

346
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,240
Wow.

347
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,880
So, I've seen the problem

348
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,960
elsewhere as well,

349
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,040
and that's what got me to,

350
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,000
like kind of my path was that way.

351
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,080
Like I helped other companies,

352
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,040
then I wanted to start my own company,

353
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,840
but I wanted to figure out

354
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,680
what I needed to solve for the world.

355
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,640
And that's kind of how I got there.

356
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,440
So, yeah.

357
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,720
Right. Digital well-being

358
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,680
goes side by side with productivity

359
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,840
in the sense that

360
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,920
you're trying to understand

361
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
how people engage

362
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,840
with their digital environments,

363
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,800
not necessarily to optimize

364
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,480
their work productivity, right, or output,

365
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,920
but to also maximize their well-being.

366
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,680
Talk to me a little bit about that.

367
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,320
I don't think I know nearly enough,

368
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
and I'm just starting out

369
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,000
in my own career,

370
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,960
so this is definitely something

371
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,080
that I want to take with me

372
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,760
as I continue my journey as an engineer,

373
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,880
but also as an entrepreneur

374
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,000
and hopefully leader.

375
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,520
Great. So, digital well-being

376
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,720
is definitely a combination

377
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,560
of different things.

378
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,880
The problem is that

379
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,800
when we try to throw

380
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,600
software at the problem,

381
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,720
I mean that was a weird sentence

382
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,400
but you get my point,

383
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,240
like throwing software

384
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,640
as a solution at a problem,

385
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,960
like this isn't gonna solve it.

386
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,680
I always say this

387
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,200
like Veamly, as a software itself,

388
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,280
is a band-aid;

389
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,720
the true solution is gonna be

390
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,800
what comes with it

391
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,720
which is what we help people achieve.

392
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,520
It's like when you buy

393
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,360
a pack of cigarettes

394
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,680
and it says smoking kills,

395
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,720
that's kind of ... thing to do

396
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,800
to educate people on really

397
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,480
how distractions and notifications

398
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,240
are really killing their day

399
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,680
and their life and their well-being.

400
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
Like, for example,

401
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,840
I have been notification free

402
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,280
for almost two years now.

403
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,550
And everybody's shocked-

404
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,360
I'm scared. I'm shocked.

405
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,160
Exactly, right.

406
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,040
You're scared, you're shocked.

407
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,560
And people are like,

408
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,960
"How do you do that?"

409
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,680
Like how, like you're a CEO,

410
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,560
you're running a company,

411
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
you're doing all these things.

412
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,520
And I always challenge people

413
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,680
to try it for three days.

414
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,960
The first time you feel true withdrawal.

415
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,520
Like for me the first time,

416
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,880
especially the first three days

417
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,680
when I started, I felt like

418
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,840
something is missing. Literally,

419
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,480
it was almost like a drug.

420
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,400
That's how I realized

421
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
how bad it is even more, right.

422
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,920
So, for us,

423
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,120
definitely that's at the core

424
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,880
of what we're doing

425
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,920
in terms of helping people

426
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,360
think differently about those.

427
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,880
But beyond that, it's the small things

428
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,600
that you implement

429
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,680
in your day to day

430
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,880
that help you do better.

431
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,000
So, even being conscious

432
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,600
about the problem,

433
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,880
disconnecting from screens.

434
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,360
like for me, you'll never find

435
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,080
my phone next to me,

436
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,400
and if you find it next to me,

437
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,800
it's always screen down, right.

438
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,080
So, it's like getting in the habit

439
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,520
of reducing distractions.

440
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,160
So, a lot of things enter

441
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,240
in making us more productive

442
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,840
and more balanced,

443
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,200
and that's your sleep quality,

444
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
your water intake, even the way-

445
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,920
Wait wait, before we continue there,

446
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,840
I have to go back a little bit

447
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,360
because I have to ask. This idea of no notifications

448
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,880
as a CEO, at the end,

449
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,640
throughout this show

450
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,280
and filming over 200 episodes,

451
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,640
one of the really interesting things

452
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,600
that have been coming up

453
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
is this idea of being connected

454
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,720
and being responsive.

455
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,920
A lot of people are really

456
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,120
taking responsiveness seriously.

457
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,480
And it always amazes me

458
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,680
how very, very busy people

459
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,000
respond very, very quickly

460
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,640
to my emails or my messages.

461
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,200
How do you portray yourself

462
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,880
as a responsive person

463
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,960
and not miss opportunities

464
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,040
or allowing people to count on you

465
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,240
in a world where

466
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,120
you're not even aware necessarily

467
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,800
that they're messaging you?

468
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,240
So, first, I love this question

469
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,920
because earlier in my career,

470
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,320
and not that long ago really,

471
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,040
I obsessed over responsiveness,

472
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,480
especially when it's like

473
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,280
somebody qualify as important,

474
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,120
whoever that is, right, in your world.

475
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,840
It could be your boss or whoever it is.

476
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,160
So it's like you're always scared,

477
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,960
"Oh, what if I don't answer,

478
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,880
and they think I'm careless?"

479
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,840
or I'm not, pretty much

480
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,360
it's all fear, right?

481
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,600
It all comes from fear,

482
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,160
at the end of the day.

483
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,440
Fear of missing out,

484
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,760
fear of being perceived wrong.

485
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,480
And the thing is,

486
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,200
I always say this even to my team,

487
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,600
it's all about intent.

488
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,760
That's number one.

489
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,280
So, I think we put the wrong weight

490
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,880
on responsiveness,

491
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,800
because we're not robots.

492
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,480
If I'm not responding to you,

493
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,600
it means I'm probably doing

494
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,240
something else,

495
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,040
I'm responsible for ... right.

496
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,800
So, if I'm working on a presentation,

497
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,480
I'm working on a product thing,

498
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,280
I don't need to be responding to you

499
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,560
unless it's something super urgent

500
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,000
and then you just call me, right,

501
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,640
and interrupt me.

502
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,360
And so the thing is is you realize

503
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,520
that most people don't care

504
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,840
if you reply to something

505
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,560
within 24 hours,

506
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,240
that's when it comes to email, right?

507
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,200
When it comes to instant messaging

508
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,960
like Slack and other things,

509
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
like it's a matter of an hour or two

510
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,920
which nobody does,

511
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,680
unless you are in a collaboration mode.

512
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,240
When you're in collaboration mode,

513
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,880
you need to schedule that.

514
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,640
Like I talk about

515
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,760
structured synchronous communication, right.

516
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,520
Like there's a whole debate

517
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,440
about async versus sync.

518
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,360
I'm like sync can be structured, right.

519
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,400
I can be in sync mode,

520
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,920
that's how we have this feature,

521
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,800
and if I'm in sync mode,

522
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,040
all my notifications are coming in,

523
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,000
but it's fine,

524
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,600
'cause I'm in collaboration mode.

525
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,840
So, I never had any issues

526
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,520
with responsiveness

527
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,760
since I've been notification free,

528
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,480
because I still check my different apps

529
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,920
on a regular basis, right.

530
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,760
If I'm done with a task at hand,

531
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,160
then I'm gonna go check

532
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,600
my main channels of communication, right.

533
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,760
So, which is I use

534
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,960
mainly Trello, JIRA, Slack, and email.

535
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,680
These are the four main ... for me.

536
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,240
So, yeah.

537
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,000
And so, when you're running

538
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,200
your company now,

539
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,280
do all your engineers have to use Veamly

540
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,280
to be productive?

541
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,600
I hope that for them.

542
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,200
They're building it,

543
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,640
so if they don't believe in it,

544
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,000
we'll have a problem, right?

545
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,480
So it not even like, for us,

546
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,600
even the whole approach,

547
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
whether it's our engineers

548
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,960
or other engineers out there,

549
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,120
the whole point is

550
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,520
we're not forcing something on you.

551
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,560
We're bringing awareness for you.

552
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,360
It's kind of what you said

553
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,240
about yourself, right

554
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,200
right now. It's like I'm an engineer.

555
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,520
I see this as like, yeah,

556
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,440
I want you to realize that for yourself

557
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,320
and hopefully we help you

558
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,160
be more balanced, be more focused

559
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,720
and do better, really.

560
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,360
100%.

561
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,920
So, back to digital well-being.

562
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,840
Go back a little bit to the scope

563
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,800
of what's happening today

564
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,400
and a little bit of where

565
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,680
we can expect to be headed,

566
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,360
especially in covid-19 times

567
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,400
when things are a little bit tricky.

568
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,160
We're not really sure of what's happening,

569
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,520
and we're not really sure

570
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,600
of our interaction

571
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,920
with the virtual environment

572
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,240
for years to come.

573
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,930
So, this is actually,

574
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,360
covid made this problem

575
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,200
even more prominent and bigger,

576
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,880
because now we don't have a separation

577
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,960
between our personal life and our work.

578
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,760
Even for me,

579
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,840
I've been running remote for years, right.

580
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,640
Before this,

581
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,960
I have launched companies remotely

582
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,880
in different countries.

583
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,960
So, but I always made it a point

584
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,400
to separate my work environment

585
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
from my personal home,

586
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,880
'cause it's very hard, right?

587
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,320
That's why like

588
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,640
one of the advice you get

589
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,120
is in order to be balanced,

590
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,560
try to have your own space,

591
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,320
try to make, create sort of a routine, etc.

592
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,640
So, back to this digital well-being aspect of it

593
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,520
in this environment we are in,

594
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,160
more than ever we need a sense of stopping,

595
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,120
creating a separation

596
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,480
between our personal life or not.

597
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,320
For me, I talk about

598
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,320
the sense of accomplishment.

599
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,240
I say with Veamly,

600
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,320
the whole point is to get you

601
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,680
to that sense of accomplishment

602
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,760
and remove FOMO.

603
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,480
You know things are there for you,

604
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,120
so you can see data

605
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,200
about how you're using your time,

606
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,920
you know what you have accomplished today,

607
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,400
you know what you need

608
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,240
to be doing tomorrow,

609
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,280
everything is there for you,

610
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,120
it's not gonna go anywhere.

611
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,360
So when you disconnect,

612
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,680
you don't have that stress of like,

613
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,440
did I miss something, right?

614
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,800
So, beyond that

615
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,080
is bringing the other

616
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,320
external factors.

617
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,760
More than ever,

618
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,760
taking care of our health and our sleep

619
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,560
and all these different things

620
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,040
that impact our productivity

621
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,080
are important.

622
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
So, for us, when we talk about that,

623
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,440
when achieving digital well-being,

624
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,000
is by bringing those

625
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,280
within Veamly pretty much.

626
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Like how can we give you

627
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,200
ergonomic nudges,

628
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,440
how can we give you like

629
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,240
not just towards how you can improve

630
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,880
all these different things about your day,

631
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,960
organizing your day like a pro pretty much,

632
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,000
in order to get to that balance.

633
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,320
And so like I mentioned it goes from, like for me

634
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,080
my challenge two years ago

635
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,880
was notification free,

636
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,680
this year my challenge is tab free.

637
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,520
So, at the end of every day

638
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,640
to close out all tabs.

639
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,120
And that's harder

640
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,080
because sometimes you go into a meeting

641
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,520
and you forget to go back to do that.

642
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,160
So, I'm still not perfect at it,

643
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,320
but it's so nice,

644
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,720
because it forces me to take

645
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,560
just five minutes

646
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,760
at the end of every day

647
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,520
and make sure I place

648
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,000
the different tabs wherever I need to,

649
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,840
because 90% of the time

650
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,480
you never go back to all these open tabs.

651
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,680
But it's just bad habits.

652
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,400
So, it takes time.

653
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,800
So, that's why it has to be incremental and

654
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,200
we have to be kind to ourselves.

655
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,120
And to achieve true digital well-being,

656
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,520
you need to become aware

657
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,400
of how you're spending your time.

658
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,040
So, awareness sounds like

659
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,520
the number one key,

660
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,960
because for every person

661
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,560
the implementation will likely

662
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,720
be a little bit different

663
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,560
fitting to their own personal needs.

664
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,960
But give me some more helpful ideas

665
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,240
of what I can be doing in my daily life

666
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,280
to have better digital well-being.

667
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,800
And right now,

668
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,280
I have to say it's tough,

669
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,680
because I'm in front of the screen

670
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,680
sometimes 16, 17 hours a day

671
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,560
both as an engineer,

672
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,400
but also running this podcast.

673
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,520
And it's a lot of screen time,

674
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,120
and I want to make sure

675
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,160
that I'm approaching this

676
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,720
in the healthiest way.

677
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,960
So, very good question.

678
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,880
So, there are a few things

679
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
you can start implementing

680
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,960
from tomorrow.

681
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,680
First, calendar blocking.

682
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,720
Sounds like trivial,

683
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,680
but it's a very good tool,

684
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,120
because calendar blocking,

685
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,320
it will help you be more intentional

686
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,520
about your time.

687
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,560
'cause awareness is key,

688
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,720
but intent is key too.

689
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,160
We are opted in by default

690
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,120
in our daily lives.

691
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,400
When you subscribe to a product,

692
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,480
you're opted in by default.

693
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,040
In your work,

694
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,760
you're opted in by default.

695
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,600
You don't take a second

696
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,200
to think about

697
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,760
how you're organizing all this.

698
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,960
So, if you ... 10 minutes every night

699
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,120
before the next day or once a week

700
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,240
to block your whole week,

701
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,120
and to make sure to plug your breaks.

702
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,440
Being in front of a computer

703
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,560
for 17 hours, like now what?

704
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,920
You're very young, right, early in your career.

705
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,440
What's gonna happen 20 years from now?

706
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,080
... gonna start having back pains

707
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,320
and carpal tunnel

708
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,880
and all these bad things,

709
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,560
like your eyes are gonna go to hell.

710
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,080
So, all these things

711
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,520
we're not intentional about them.

712
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,160
So, calendar blocking, amazing tool

713
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,880
to help you schedule your breaks

714
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,400
and realize also be even more focused,

715
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,240
because once you have that,

716
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,680
then you have that rewarding aspect.

717
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,000
That's how our brain works.

718
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,880
You have a trigger,

719
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,200
and then you have a reward.

720
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,840
So you know it's like,

721
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,440
Oh, if I'm gonna do this for two hours,

722
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,440
I'm gonna take a 30 minute break,

723
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,160
and then I'm gonna do

724
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,240
something else in that break.

725
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,160
Workout or go for a walk

726
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,040
or watch something,

727
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,400
whatever it is that you like doing.

728
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,880
So, that's the number one.

729
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,040
Two, sleep sleep sleep.

730
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,400
That's super important.

731
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,360
We don't give enough weight

732
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,200
to the importance

733
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,440
of having a good night's sleep.

734
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,080
It's important for everything,

735
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,920
for our focus

736
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,400
but even for our bodies, our health,

737
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,640
even our workout routine,

738
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,560
diet, everything.

739
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,520
So, that's an "easy" one

740
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,320
to also schedule

741
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,280
part of calendar blocking

742
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,120
to be like at this time

743
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,520
And it helps to use technology, right?

744
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,560
For me, technology is not bad;

745
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,440
it's about how you can

746
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,120
leverage technology

747
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,200
to get to your true digital well-being.

748
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,000
Technology is not bad,

749
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,840
but it can be misused.

750
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,680
Exactly.

751
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,160
Right.

752
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,840
So, if you have an Alexa or a Google home

753
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,360
or ... reminder,

754
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,840
put your reminder to go to sleep.

755
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,440
It sounds trivial, but put that.

756
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,120
Create a sleep routine.

757
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,440
Like that's the time you,

758
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,680
okay, before sleeping

759
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,440
I want to drink water,

760
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,960
I want to read 10 pages of a book,

761
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,720
and do this thing.

762
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,000
Create that routine,

763
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,040
and then little by little

764
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,240
you'll get back to it.

765
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,400
The problem is that we are lost,

766
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,160
and we don't know where to get started.

767
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,280
That's where it gets really, really hard.

768
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,200
So, these are some of the few things

769
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,400
you can start with day one.

770
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,600
I strongly recommend
- I love it.

771
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,880
to organize your phone.

772
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,800
I know phones

773
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
are our biggest stressors today.

774
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,200
Notifications, also when you have

775
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,560
five pages of 90 different apps

776
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,560
that you don't use anyway.

777
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,920
So, if you take five seconds,

778
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,520
if you see my phone screen,

779
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,960
I have maybe 10 folders,

780
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,560
one that says work tools,

781
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,520
one that's a social one, finance.

782
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,320
And all these little things then

783
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,200
are not too hard to implement.

784
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,680
They accumulate, they accumulate.

785
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,400
They accumulate, and it will create

786
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,160
that incremental change

787
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,440
will add up to be something

788
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,720
really impactful on you.

789
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,480
Emna, this is a wonderful.

790
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,680
Thank you for being so generous

791
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,160
with your time.

792
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,800
Before we leave,

793
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,080
I have to ask you for three words

794
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,120
that you would use to describe yourself.

795
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,160
Communication, process, and data.

796
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,920
All around ...

797
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,640
So, I'll say

798
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,520
that's my holy trifecta.

799
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,120
So it's like

800
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,320
communication, process, and data,

801
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,040
in the middle, people are the center.

802
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,720
So, yeah.

803
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,600
People are the center.

804
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,400
I like that.

805
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,080
Emna, thank you very, very much.

806
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,240
Best of luck with Veamly.

807
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,400
Stay safe and stay healthy,

808
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,080
and I love the mission.

809
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,200
Thank you very much.

810
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,600
Thank you.

811
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,520
Take care.
