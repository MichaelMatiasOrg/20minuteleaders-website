1
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,920
Alon Girmonsky, thank you so much

2
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,760
for joining me on the show.

3
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,160
How are you?

4
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,480
I'm good, Michael. Thanks.

5
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,440
I'm very good.

6
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
Okay. In two words,

7
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,840
what is it like running a startup

8
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,160
in corona times?

9
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,760
Give me the ...

10
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,840
Crazy.

11
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,000
But startup life is crazy

12
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,440
so it's not that different.

13
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,480
Wonderful. Okay.

14
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,640
Alon, like I mentioned

15
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,400
right before we started,

16
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,480
if I were to list all the companies

17
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,520
that you've been involved with

18
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,080
in acquisition, whether it was

19
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,200
companies that you founded,

20
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,960
was the CTO, VP engineering,

21
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,640
or anything of that sort,

22
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,000
we wouldn't have been able

23
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,320
to fit it in 20 minutes.

24
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,360
But I am going to ask you,

25
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,080
can you just give me

26
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,000
a really brief rundown

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
where you came from

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,840
all the way from when you were in Atudai

29
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,720
in the Israeli Defense Forces

30
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,480
all the way up until now

31
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,320
when you are running UP9.

32
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,600
Give me the brief rundown.

33
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
I'm not sure I can do that

34
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,120
because when I was actually at Atudai

35
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,280
that was too long,

36
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,600
my memory doesn't serve me

37
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,440
that long ago.

38
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,440
But no. I'm the normal kind

39
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,120
of Israeli startup nation story.

40
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,640
What does that mean?

41
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,120
It's a playbook, right?

42
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,440
That we all go to the military, right,

43
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,440
meaning the good guys go

44
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,760
to ... and guys like us,

45
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,000
we go and build things

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,560
more programs and stuff.

47
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,200
So, I started there.

48
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,920
At Atudai six years,

49
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,800
nine with school and everything.

50
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,240
Did my own startup.

51
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,240
My first startup was good.

52
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,320
It was okay.

53
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,760
Compel.

54
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,200
What is okay mean? Just for context

55
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,800
because 99% of startups just fail.

56
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,280
So, when you're saying okay,

57
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,160
That's okay.

58
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,000
It's okay to fail.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,840
Don't let anyone tell you different.

60
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,560
No. So yeah.

61
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,840
And with startup life, it's very easy

62
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,520
to talk about your successes

63
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,400
but again, you won't be there.

64
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,640
You are not an entrepreneur.

65
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,320
You are not in the real startup life

66
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,720
if 90% of your experiments fail.

67
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,240
Right.

68
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,200
I don't know of anyone

69
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,720
that kind of okay.

70
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,360
You're just in them.

71
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,560
They can join someone

72
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,320
and then they will be successful

73
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,000
but that someone for sure

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,720
made many mistakes and failures.
- Makes a lot of sense

75
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,640
Yeah.

76
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,360
But on TechCrunch,

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,560
you read about the successes

78
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,320
and that's obviously the cognitive bias

79
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,000
that we now have.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,640
But Alon, nevertheless,

81
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,920
you went through the

82
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,360
you're saying

83
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,680
the traditional Israeli route.

84
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,160
Going to the military

85
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,440
and doing some meaningful things there

86
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,080
not so much Tel Aviv,

87
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,520
but other very meaningful things.

88
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,400
And then moving on,

89
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,960
creating a startup that's okay.

90
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,640
And then you're involved

91
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,760
in a series of acquisitions.

92
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,560
And what I want to get out of these

93
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,320
next 17 minutes or so,

94
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,560
is I want to pick your brain

95
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,400
about a field or the subject

96
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,520
that we talked about,

97
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,200
whether it's the transitions between

98
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,480
employer or employee

99
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,600
versus like a founder or an entrepreneur.

100
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,360
What it means to build teams,

101
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,480
build products.

102
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,920
So, let's start with that first one.

103
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,120
What does it mean,

104
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,840
that dissonance between being an employee

105
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,160
versus being an entrepreneur?

106
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,600
Yeah, I think you coined it right.

107
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,680
There is a dissonance

108
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,560
because for whatever reason,

109
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,880
people look at startups and founders

110
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
and entrepreneurs and think,

111
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,680
"Hey, that's fun.

112
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,080
We should do that."

113
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,440
And then I turn to them and say,

114
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,920
"You need to have a bug.

115
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,400
You need to be somewhat crazy,

116
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,720
to actually want.

117
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,320
For years,

118
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,920
you're probably top of your class.

119
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,880
Very smart. Can do a lot of things,

120
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,280
but let's settle for half the take.

121
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,160
Work three times as much for half the pay.

122
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,760
Fail nine times out of ten.

123
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,360
So, you really want to do that"

124
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,520
So there is a dissonance between

125
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
how it looks like and how it is.

126
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,960
I can tell you that entrepreneurs,

127
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,440
at least from where I look at it,

128
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,560
they don't have a choice.

129
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,360
Okay? They cannot take orders.

130
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,400
They cannot follow instructions.

131
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,840
They can try and they'll probably

132
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,600
be good at it for a while,

133
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,760
but something inside will die.

134
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,680
So I think that's the main difference.

135
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,360
If you can get a job at Google, do it.

136
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,320
I highly recommend doing it.

137
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,640
Why do you recommend that?

138
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:41,000
Because I think this is, again,

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,320
I can't. I simply can't.

140
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,800
And if I could, maybe I would.

141
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,600
I tried meaning,

142
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,480
BlazeMeter my recent company, was acquired

143
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,120
by CA and then Broadcom.

144
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,560
Very good position.

145
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,400
Good company. Different company.

146
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,320
It's not Facebook, right?

147
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,160
But, I can't. I cannot.

148
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
When I had to choose -

149
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,840
what I'm about to do next.

150
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
When did you discover this

151
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,880
about yourself that you simply can't?

152
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,200
Long time ago.

153
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,960
When you try and try and try

154
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,400
and you rather fail

155
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,080
in an attempt of building something

156
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,280
because this is where you get the value.

157
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,100
You get the value

158
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,840
when you build something, right?

159
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,000
Right.

160
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,200
I rather fail there or be successful

161
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,480
for doing someone else's bidding.

162
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,240
Interesting.

163
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,400
Yeah. So for me,

164
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,040
there was no option other than

165
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,120
So now I want to extrapolate this,

166
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,920
and as you're building your teams

167
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,360
across the different companies,

168
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,160
I'm wondering

169
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,960
You're bringing on to your startups

170
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,520
oftentimes the early employees,

171
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,160
a lot of them do have that bug in

172
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,720
their eye.

173
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,920
They're also entrepreneurial.

174
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,520
They want to be a part

175
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,840
of the success story,

176
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,200
but you need to find somebody

177
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,520
who can take orders

178
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,600
and can fulfill your tasks

179
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,480
and your requests

180
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,040
even though they're having this

181
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,560
entrepreneurial spirit.

182
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,160
So, how do you go about doing that?

183
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,800
You tell me

184
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,960
because I wasn't successful in doing that.

185
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,000
No, I'm dead serious.

186
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,480
I have a team of 15 people.

187
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,400
They do not listen to me, right?

188
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,760
And no matter what I do.

189
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,600
I need to convince them

190
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,640
that what I see is right

191
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,280
and maybe they will follow, okay?

192
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,480
But, especially Israelis,

193
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,240
meaning they do not follow orders.

194
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,880
They talk back.

195
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,200
Right.

196
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,960
And for example in America,

197
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,680
this is something

198
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,040
that doesn't happen too often, right?

199
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,160
So especially with my team

200
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,480
that currently is mostly Israeli,

201
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,760
they don't do what I say.

202
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,520
It's very simple.

203
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
Yeah. Well but I'm sure that, again,

204
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,120
as the CEO, I mean, at some point

205
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,960
you do make a decision, right

206
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,080
And at some point you say,

207
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,680
"Guys, listen. This is our strategy."

208
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,120
I mean, you have a few responsibilities.

209
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,040
Hire the best people,

210
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,360
make sure you have enough runway

211
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,400
to continue the company,

212
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,520
and have a vision

213
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,040
for where the company is headed.

214
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,480
And at some point, there is a difference

215
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,640
between your understanding of the market

216
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,160
and where you're headed

217
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,280
versus employee number 15.

218
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,360
There must be, isn't there?

219
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,400
Maybe in employee number 500.

220
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,120
But, no.

221
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,520
And you actually said it

222
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,280
the three items.

223
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,920
One is, point to the vision, right?

224
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,840
This is what I do.

225
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,280
And you do it once.

226
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,000
If you're lucky, you do it once.

227
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,960
You can maybe do it twice or three times.

228
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,120
The fourth time you're out.

229
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,600
But you point to the vision

230
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,680
and from that point onward,

231
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,800
you explain, you pitch the vision,

232
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,200
and the more communicative you are,

233
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,560
people will follow.

234
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,840
People are looking for someone

235
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,520
to follow at the end of the day, right?

236
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,760
You fundraise.

237
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,120
That's the responsibility of the founder.

238
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,080
If you cannot fundraise,

239
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,600
don't bring someone else to do it for you.

240
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,080
Find a job, right?

241
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,320
Right.

242
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,840
You fundraise to create longevity

243
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,880
for the company. And then

244
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,680
you hire the best people you can.

245
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,780
And I added you can

246
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,120
'cause sometimes

247
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,080
this is what you can do.

248
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,360
But if you hire these people

249
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,520
and you explain to them

250
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,800
and they actually agree with you,

251
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,840
if they don't agree with you,

252
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,280
they will not follow you.

253
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,520
Right.

254
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,160
If they agree with you,

255
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,240
the dialogue doesn't need to happen

256
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,960
on a daily basis, right.

257
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,120
The North Star should be there.

258
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,880
Yeah. So what I'm hearing from you is,

259
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,520
a lot of it is trust.

260
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,640
But it's not just, I hear a lot that

261
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,880
employees need to trust their CEO.

262
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,400
Employees need to trust their CEO.

263
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,160
He sets the vision.

264
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,720
He or she sets the vision.

265
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,280
But what you're also referencing is that

266
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,640
the CEO has to trust their employees

267
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,960
because in the whole art of

268
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,600
talking back and bouncing ideas,

269
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,560
and when you're telling me proudly

270
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,920
that your team doesn't listen to you,

271
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,320
obviously they listen to you,

272
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,240
but when you're saying that,

273
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,520
what I hear is a proud statement of

274
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,960
my team, they are entrepreneurial,

275
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,920
they're independent thinkers

276
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,800
and they challenged me on my ideas.

277
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,360
And that's why we work so well together

278
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,560
because we respect

279
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,640
and we trust each other.

280
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,120
Is that right?

281
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,360
That's absolutely correct.

282
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,720
But again, everything I'm saying,

283
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,640
by the way this is not the truth.

284
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,520
This is not object.

285
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,840
This is me, okay?

286
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,960
So I've learned, I've tried to be

287
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,800
like the decision maker would.

288
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,320
I have this right hand

289
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,280
and that right hand,

290
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,160
and this right hand.

291
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,440
... my right hand, right

292
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,920
It doesn't scale, okay

293
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,360
And I survived that era

294
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,880
to a point where it's all about the why.

295
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,360
Right.

296
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,600
If I am able to convince you

297
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,920
why we are doing this,

298
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,280
you'll follow me.

299
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,440
I don't need even to explain.

300
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,600
You will have your own vision

301
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,440
and it's good enough.

302
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,960
If I constantly need to manage you,

303
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,440
we're in a bad place.

304
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,680
Totally. So Alon, what number

305
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,040
startup is this that you're involved with?

306
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,200
Oh my God. Come on.

307
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,520
I don't remember.

308
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,440
Is it after two hands?

309
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,000
So, are you asking how many companies

310
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,240
I have founded over the years?

311
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,080
Or no you were involved with.

312
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,560
No, no, no.

313
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,360
That's too many to count.

314
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,280
Especially in this day and age

315
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,680
where I'm also investing

316
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,160
but I'm investing in a company

317
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,120
that I can help at least at the beginning.

318
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,480
So I don't know, 20, 30, 40.

319
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,000
Okay, so Alon, what I really want to know is

320
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,760
give me your one or two earned secrets

321
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,920
after 20 or 30 companies

322
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,840
that you are watching

323
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,320
these scrappy, hungry entrepreneurs

324
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,040
and these great teams

325
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,960
because you're choosing diligently

326
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,080
the companies that you're either

327
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,680
investing in or you're founding,

328
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,760
or working for.

329
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,480
What have you learned over these years

330
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,200
that a young entrepreneur like myself

331
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,960
as I go along my journey,

332
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,120
I don't have to go to 20, 30 companies.

333
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,320
I can just listen to your advice,

334
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,440
and take it as it is.

335
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:06,440
Listen in a very limited manner. Yeah.

336
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,680
I've learned something that I was taught

337
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,240
meaning I had great mentors, right

338
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,960
Even though that when I started,

339
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,360
let's talk about the past 10 years

340
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,200
because I don't remember what was before.

341
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,760
It was too long ago, right

342
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,680
But I had great mentors, right

343
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,720
And they taught me

344
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,400
I said, "I know a lot,

345
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,240
but there's far more that I don't know,

346
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,800
and I want to learn from people

347
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,200
who actually know"

348
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,720
So one of the things they told me,

349
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,040
"Listen, it's all about you."

350
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,360
And I said,

351
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
"What? What do you mean about me?"

352
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,480
"It's all about you" Okay.

353
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,880
If you believe it, it will happen.

354
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,280
If you don't believe it,

355
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,160
no one will help you get there.

356
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,440
And I've learned this to be true.

357
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,360
I've learned that if a founder believes,

358
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,880
it's not about believing in God,

359
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,720
it's not religion.

360
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,760
If you can envision, okay,

361
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,040
the way you're headed

362
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,680
and you actually believe

363
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,440
you can go there,

364
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,080
A, you'll get there.

365
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,280
B, people will follow.

366
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,080
Okay?

367
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,200
So it's all about the founder

368
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,360
or the founders, right.

369
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,120
Co-founders.

370
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:19,480
So, I try to do it where I live.

371
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,920
Again I'm back to,

372
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,440
I have some experience behind me,

373
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,360
but I'm back to being a founder.

374
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,280
It's the same exact experience

375
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:31,960
every other founder has.

376
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
What becomes easier over time?

377
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,200
So now that you're a serial founder

378
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,880
and you've had successes behind you

379
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,000
and you're coming now with UP9,

380
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,720
what's easier than before?

381
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,160
What's easier than before?

382
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,600
First, I can tell you that

383
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,760
it's never easy.

384
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,440
Even when you think you know it all,

385
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,920
and you've done it all,

386
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,200
you learn that

387
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,240
because you're not doing the same thing.

388
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,080
Right?

389
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,360
So, apparently every story

390
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,440
has its own unique complexities.

391
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:02,920
Okay?

392
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,000
So, that's the one thing.

393
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,800
But experience does help you

394
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,920
because you know what to expect

395
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,000
on the other end.

396
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,520
And I think the one thing

397
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,320
that causes people to halt

398
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,120
is the fear of what will happen.

399
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,800
And when you know,

400
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
hey, we've been through that crises

401
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,840
and we've done that

402
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,120
and that customer left us

403
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,440
and this term sheet blew up, right?

404
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,600
And whatever.

405
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,040
You know okay, I know what to expect.

406
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,400
I know how to manage it.

407
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,880
I know how to compare it

408
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,320
to other kind of situations

409
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,880
I was in the past.

410
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,800
Having said that,

411
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
that helps you some.

412
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,760
You still need to deal

413
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,720
with the day to day,

414
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,400
with new

415
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,600
and that's the fun of it.
- Right.

416
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,040
So it's not a problem.

417
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,080
Definitely. And now you're investing.

418
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,880
We know each other through J-Ventures.

419
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,520
For example.

420
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,720
And you're investing

421
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,440
and at the same time, you're the CEO

422
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,360
of an early stage startup, right?

423
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,280
Yeah. Yeah.

424
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,600
And to be honest

425
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,520
How does that work?

426
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,000
It sounds so weird

427
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,440
that you're both investing

428
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,600
in early stage startups,

429
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,000
but you have an early stage startup

430
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,720
of your own.

431
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,520
Yeah.

432
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,840
The one thing you learn very quickly is

433
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,120
when you compare your time versus money,

434
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,640
invest the money.

435
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,400
It's easier.

436
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,800
You put it there,

437
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,440
hopefully you chose well.

438
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,760
Right?

439
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,280
And usually, I don't just invest.

440
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,600
Right?

441
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,240
It needs to be the founding team.

442
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,360
It needs to be the industry

443
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,200
that I understand.

444
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,400
So, it's not a guess, right

445
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,680
Right. Of course.

446
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,280
But it's easier to invest than,

447
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,680
for example, to be an adviser.

448
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,000
Interesting.

449
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,440
Okay. And to be honest with you,

450
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,600
I had far more time when I was,

451
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,680
in the past three to four years,

452
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,520
when I was an executive

453
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,960
in a bigger company.

454
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,120
Today, there's no time.

455
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,560
Zero time.

456
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,880
It's negative time.

457
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,760
But again, I'm enjoying every second.

458
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,400
I do support the companies

459
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,200
I have invested in

460
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,480
or am actively advising to

461
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,080
but I'm not taking, at least not

462
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,480
no more advisory roles.

463
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
Interesting.

464
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,120
Where do you get more energy from:

465
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,560
The investor in you

466
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,280
or the entrepreneur in you?

467
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,800
That's an easy question.

468
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,000
That's an easy question.

469
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,640
I took a decision, a conscious decision.

470
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,800
Should I go into investments

471
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,600
and help companies,

472
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,280
or do the not so logical thing

473
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,320
which is jump back in to where I just was.

474
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
Okay?

475
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,610
It sounds like that takes a crazy person to
go through all these ...

476
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,040
and then jump back in

477
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,160
and do it again from the start.

478
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,960
Yeah, but I've realized that

479
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,120
a long time ago.

480
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,360
So you have to have this

481
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,320
something in your head

482
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,560
and then you cannot avoid it.

483
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,440
Unfortunately.

484
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:03,920
Definitely. Okay Alon,

485
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,040
give me your two cents

486
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,960
about building products.

487
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,200
That's also something we mentioned before.

488
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,960
You've built quite a few products.

489
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,440
Give me the dos and don'ts.

490
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,160
When you approach a product

491
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,560
that you're examining,

492
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,920
what are you looking for

493
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,480
and what are some of the big pitfalls

494
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,800
that we can watch out for?

495
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,640
Yeah.

496
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,000
So, assuming you chose the market right

497
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,400
right

498
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,000
Assuming you chose the problem,

499
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,680
set of problem and solution,

500
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,480
that is kind of big enough to matter, okay?

501
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,160
When there is, let's say

502
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,840
you have a vision market fit,

503
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,600
the next thing is product market fit.

504
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,040
Okay?

505
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,080
It doesn't come first,

506
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,960
but it definitely comes second.

507
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,920
And I think this is critical.

508
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:55,240
And I think you cannot overinvest in this.

509
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,480
It's a period of time,

510
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,640
and everything is relatively easy.

511
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,480
Vision is easy.

512
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,720
Fundraising is easy.

513
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,640
Scaling is easy.

514
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,240
Product market fit,

515
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,480
if you do it right,

516
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,400
yes, everything else is easy.

517
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,080
If you do it wrong,

518
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,520
everything else become impossible.

519
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:12,840
And I think

520
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,960
that's a little counterintuitive

521
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,720
for I think a lot of people,

522
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,520
because when you look at

523
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,120
all the fancy YouTube videos

524
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,040
or all the lectures that you can attend,

525
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,960
most of them are how to raise money

526
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,800
and how to build a strong team

527
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
and how to how to how to.

528
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,880
But I almost never see a session

529
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,720
on how to find product market fit

530
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,000
and how to measure your NPS score.

531
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,880
How to know objectively

532
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,920
whether you've actually reached

533
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,240
product market fit.

534
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,160
Yeah. And you mentioned NPS

535
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,960
and other tools,

536
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,280
but I think that, we're all engineers.

537
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,400
This is good and also bad

538
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,240
because we have so many ideas.

539
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,280
One of the rules I had is,

540
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,760
you have an idea, I have an idea.

541
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,320
Let's forget about these ideas.

542
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,560
And you would say killing innovation,

543
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,840
but that's not correct, right

544
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,960
If a customer tells you that,

545
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,120
if the first customer,

546
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,000
the second, the third,

547
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,640
this is it.

548
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,400
This is what we are going to do.

549
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,360
Forget about your idea and mine.

550
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,760
Now, having said that,

551
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,680
customers don't always tell you,

552
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,600
they tell you what they want

553
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,720
not what they need.

554
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,400
So it's your job to hear them, and then

555
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,080
reflect back what you think they need

556
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,760
which will be the base

557
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,280
for a product market fit.

558
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,480
Yeah.

559
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,880
And I think that there's the funny quote

560
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,880
from the, looking back,

561
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,040
that if we had listened

562
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,800
to what customers wanted

563
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,560
back in the early 1900s,

564
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,600
we'd just make faster horses.

565
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,160
Agreed. Good example.

566
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,280
Definitely. Alon,

567
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,920
what are you really passionate about?

568
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,480
Fine. Yeah.

569
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,000
Startups, entrepreneurship,

570
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,880
all these journeys.

571
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,320
I got it. You're crazy.

572
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,560
But what are you really,

573
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,560
when you wake up every day,

574
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,280
what is the highlight of your moment

575
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,120
the highlight of your day?

576
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,840
Listen, I have a ton of things

577
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,600
I'm passionate about.

578
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,080
Okay?

579
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,400
And there are periods in life,

580
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,440
like electric guitar and stuff like that.

581
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,800
Anything related to music.

582
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,400
Cars, motorcycles, mountain bike,

583
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,880
road bike, anything

584
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,360
extreme wise, diving.

585
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,160
You know I had master, not master,

586
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,600
but three stars in diving.

587
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,440
I forget the degree there.

588
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,920
When you build a company,

589
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,040
there's no other thing.

590
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,480
24 hours a day, for as many years.

591
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,160
Right

592
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,800
At least that's the way I'm doing it.

593
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,720
It's very tough to keep a

594
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,080
life-work balance.

595
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,680
I have three kids, right, here

596
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,160
at home in Palo Alto and everything.

597
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,960
And I think that we are able

598
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,920
to keep a work-life balance,

599
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,520
but you wake up in the morning,

600
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,400
Slack, e-mails and stuff like that.

601
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,840
So, and I'm not sure, some people

602
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,200
I'm sure many people

603
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
will tell you otherwise,

604
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,960
but this is me.

605
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,800
And that was before.

606
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,040
And this is a period in time.

607
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,080
It's a few years that you don't,

608
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,680
this is it.

609
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,680
This is what you do and your passionate.

610
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,800
This is what I want to do.

611
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
I don't want to do anything else.

612
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,360
I love it. I love it. I love it.

613
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,360
Alon, before we leave,

614
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,320
the most important question.

615
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,360
I need three words

616
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,200
that you would use to describe yourself

617
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,840
or that any of your employees

618
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,880
or current or past co-founders

619
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,840
would define you as.

620
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:44,560
So, okay.

621
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,560
So, I would define myself

622
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,040
as a founder and an engineer.

623
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,520
And I'm trying to keep professional

624
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,080
into the career, not

625
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,120
you know I love my family

626
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,120
and we're very much an Israeli family

627
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,920
and everything.

628
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,200
Yeah.

629
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,400
But I think an engineer and entrepreneur.

630
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
I don't have a third.

631
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,320
I know you asked for three,

632
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:13,160
but I know how people talked about me,

633
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,320
and not only employees, but customers.

634
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,160
Crazy CEO. Okay?

635
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,280
And just to explain,

636
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,760
it's not like everyone wants to be crazy

637
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,200
because it's maybe fun and other thing,

638
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,560
but always exaggerate.

639
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,840
Like you go into a show,

640
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,000
you're doing something,

641
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,720
you're expected to do this, do that. Okay?

642
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,560
To a point where actually

643
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,920
a prospect they came in and say,

644
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,600
"Hey, your CEO is crazy."

645
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,160
And I said,

646
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,120
"Good. I feel comfortable."

647
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,760
I love it.

648
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,000
Alon, toda raba.

649
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,600
Thank you very very much.

650
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,160
It's such a pleasure.

651
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,480
I learned so much.

652
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,720
And best of luck with covid

653
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,280
and best of luck with UP9.

654
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,400
Thank you so much Michael

655
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,920
and awesome initiative.

656
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,080
I'm so happy that you reached out.

657
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,240
Thank you. Take care.
