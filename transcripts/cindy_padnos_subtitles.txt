i All right. Wonderful. Cindy Padnos, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. It's a pleasure to be here. Thank you. It's so great to have you. I can't wait to learn so much as much as I can over these next 20 minutes. You know, I'm not gonna be able to do justice for all the incredible things you've done. But just as a background. You're running Illuminate Ventures that I think you've deployed over a hundred million dollars, and incredible investments, which I'd love to hear a little bit about your investment strategy there. Fast Company has cited you as one of the most influential women in tech. San Francisco Business Times, something similar. You're very excited about women in tech in general. And you have been a widely cited paper called High Performance Entrepreneurs: Women In High-Tech. Okay, I've done my part. Cindy, talk to me a little bit about where you come from. How did you get started with entrepreneurship? And let's roll into illuminate ventures. Okay, love to. But your first question is a good one. Because I come from a very entrepreneurial family. My grandfather left Eastern Europe. Built his own business in the United States. That was then run by my father and uncle. Then by my four siblings. Wow. And now by the fourth generation that's involved in that business. So I grew up in that business. I grew up understanding what it meant to have integrity. I understood what hard work was. I understood what working on weekends meant. Because I would go into the office with my father doing everything known to mankind. And so, interestingly enough, I assume from day one that I would do something entrepreneurial in my life. But I took an interesting, circuitous path to get there. I had to get my MBA at Carnegie Mellon. I came out of there and actually joined the largest corporation in the world. At the time. And I started really, really big. And I learned what it was like to sell into large enterprises and all the rest of that. But my first job was actually a sales position. Wow. And I think that's one of the best jobs you can have. Including after you get your MBA. Because you learn about how to overcome obstacles. [--] Cindy,  I'm sorry. I'm losing you a little bit. I'm sorry I lost you. Can you go back to that? About why the sales is, Why having a sales position early on is important? Yeah. I think it's really interesting about having an early role in your life in sales is that you are constantly facing obstacles and objections. And you learn how to overcome those. You learn how to deal with adversity. You learn how to deal when people say no. And to move on. And continue feeling that you can still be successful in spite of one person, perhaps one customer saying "No". I think those are skills and learnings that are really, really helpful as an entrepreneur. I've heard that quite a few times, I've heard it quite a few times actually. That  one of the most important things to really hone in is, especially as young entrepreneurs is to be able to sell. Which is or almost counter intuitive to what you know, I grew up learning is selling is bad. Just build impactful stuff and and the people will come to you. But now I hear a lot of really incredible people say that actually having the skill sets of selling and being able to communicate well, that's incredibly important. Yeah, I think sales is a really maligned job and title. In some companies, I remember when I was doing this at IBM you were they were pull up marketers. And I think this is not marketing. They're selling. You know, just face it. Admit it. Be proud of it. And I was proud of it. I was one of the top 10 sales people in an organization that had hundreds of thousands of employees. You were one of the top 10 salespeople at IBM? At AT&T. At AT&T. Yeah. Wow. Unbelievable. And I was very proud of that. Right? And you had to work very hard to get that. But it wasn't that I wanted to be a salesperson. The rest of my life. But what a great experience. I mean, even after my MBA, the training they put me through included how to overcome objections. How to communicate better with people. Helped me understand my own style. And how that could relate to other people. And it was super helpful. And it also took me down a notch or two from time to time when customers just said "No". Right. Well, I'm guessing that to get to the top, then you have a lot of yeses along with those no's. So, I'm guessing that that's pretty incredible. So, take me to Illuminate Ventures. And why are you running a venture firm? Why are you investing in other entrepreneurs having gone through your path? That's a great question as well. I had gotten to a point in my career where I had been, I've been at a number of startups. I had founded my own. We had been fortunate to have that be acquired by a public company. And I started working with some of my friends in the venture community. Doing roles that people today would call venture partner. Operating partner kinds of activities. And I had an amazing opportunity to work with some very respected investors. I didn't start doing that thinking I would become a VC. But over time, I realized that it was an amazing opportunity for me to start applying skills and experiences. And just knowledge sets that I had acquired over many many years. And my network. And I would say the network itself was perhaps the most important element of it. I knew investors because I had been out raising capital for my own company. I knew entrepreneurs because I'd been in several entrepreneurial startups. And I also knew people in the corporate world, customers, business partners, etcetera that I could then leverage those relationships to help a whole series of founders. Rather than just help myself getting access into those. And I suddenly started discovering that even though I had never set out to do it, I didn't have a finance degree. I had a very quantitative MBA from Carnegie Mellon. But I've never been on that side of the equation. I believe you very recently gave a commencement address. Right? To the School of Engineering? The master's program on the West Coast campus. Yes. I had a really great privilege and terrifying to do that. Because you're always right. Oh no. You don't want to mess up someone's college graduation. There you go. Yeah. It was a great honor. Yes. But in any case, the opportunity for me suddenly just staring me right in the face. So, I looked at it and I said, "Why not create a portfolio versus invest all of my time and energy in one company? And why not start giving back into my community  of the things that I've learned over so many years and experiences." And then I had the good fortune to be invited to join one of those firms that I was doing some projects with. I invested out of their fund for about four years. Had an opportunity to build a track record of it. Then 2008 came along. And that was super interesting. Because the firm I was with have had offered me a full partnership. They were going to go out and raise a new fund. But I stood back and I realized how much the world had changed. When I started my company, a company called Vivant, which was a SAS services procurement software company. The public cloud didn't yet exist. And so we had to-- When was this again? That was in 1999. Wow. So the Internet is about four or five years old, really. Right? That's right. No, no, no. Pre-AWS. That's for sure. Right? And yet there were companies that were choosing to move down the path of having a recurring revenue model of building a multi-tenant architecture. But we had to spend a lot of money to do that. We had to buy all of those tools anyway. We had to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for an Oracle database slice sets with all sorts of servers. And then we had to pay to host everything at Rackspace. So we created our own. And that's what every company them that wanted to do what  SAS had to do. And then, of course, brilliant people came after that. And that's what I stood back and realized, "My gosh, I needed $2 million just to start my company." I needed to buy the servers of the software and everything else. Look for the brightest  in the line of code. And from 2004 to 2008, I was investing in early stage companies. But that was still series A. That wasn't seed. There was no such word as a series seed back then. You had angels. And then you had series A. And I looked at it and I said, "This is just crazy." Companies don't need $2 million. Or $4 million to get started any more. They need credit card. And they need some chutzpah. And they need to go out there. And start building something. I love it. And so that's what I started looking for. And I realized that there weren't any seed stage funds that were focused exclusively on enterprise software. Most of the people starting funds that were at that point, they were called micro VCs. Most of those funds were focused on consumer Internet. Because the people came out of their wall or came out of some, more consumer centric kind of a business. So crazy beans were taken. Many of them I must have dosed myself heavily because in 2009, right in the middle of the financial crisis, I decided to launch Illuminate. To focus on exclusively seed stage enterprise investing. So, the world was collapsing and you're starting a new venture arm to invest more money. To spend more money. Yeah. I love it. I started the firm and I launched it in 2009. And I understood at the time I was at least smart enough to understand it wasn't a great time to go out and raise capital. So, I started warehousing investments using my own capital. And when I went to raise the first fund, it was small. It was a proof of concept fun. And I basically contributed those investments into that fund. And they became what we now call Spotlight Fund. Which we did a one and done and closed it in late 2011. Then we closed our fund. Roman numeral one in 2013. and Roman numeral two in 2017. I guess that was mid 2017. We started investing from that fund. And my partner Jennifer joined me just about a year and a half ago now. And we'll go raise our third fund. So, Incredible. Okay. So, Illuminate over these past, I guess, 10, 11 years. How have you noticed this venture arm transition? As you're gaining more experience. As you're seeing hundreds or thousands of companies. What kind of earned secrets did you gain over these years? What kind of secrets have I gave? Earned secrets. Stuff that only from experience you could really gain. Yeah. I think one of them is to really spend your time finding the people that you want to work with. More so than the technologies of the products or even the markets. If I've learned one thing, it's that early stage investing is all about the people. Right. All about the people. And, of course, you know, there needs to be product market fit eventually and all of those other things. But if you've got the right team, and you have a much, much higher probability of success. Not only that though. Some of the companies that I've worked with, I've sat on the boards now at Bright Edge. It's almost 11 years. And exactly before we took them public and then they were acquired by [--] and that was 10 years. And so, you really better, at minimum, trust and respect the people that you're going to invest in. Because you may be working with them, if you're lucky, for a very long time. That's the goal. So, have you ever invested in a company that you didn't necessarily believe in? But you really believed in the people. And you felt that these people are a good, bad. Maybe the product is not. But I trust that they'll pivot if necessary. I don't think so. To be really honest. Well, I think that in you're seeing a thousand deals a year or something. Then you're going to find a good combination. Right? But we have the opportunity to be very selective and entrepreneurs do as well. And, you know, we look for the fit. You look for the fit. I love that. Okay. Talk to me a little bit about a women in tech. Women entrepreneurs. I mean, you started long before 2020. When you know things are looking up. Talk to me a little bit about this. What you noticed over the past few decades as you're in technology? You know, I don't have the luxury of living so long and knowing and seeing these things progress. I'm coming into a time in the workplace where, you know, as far as I'm concerned, everything is equal. And every VC that I talk to has at least one woman who is a founding member or a managing director. So, talk to me a little bit about what's happened over these past years. Well, sure, I'd be happy to. So, when I wrote the first white paper, which was back in 2010. So, 10 years ago, it's kind of remarkable. I was never intending to invest only in women. But, I did know having been a woman founder, CEO of myself, that there were challenges. That there were some obstacles that women faced and other minority groups as well, not just women. That the typical white male did not. And I thought it was important to try and understand. Are those obstacles self-imposed in some cases? Are they pipeline issues? As many people always have suggested. What are the obstacles? And also try to understand. Okay, for those women who did receive funding, who managed to somehow get to that level. What happened? How well did they perform? Was there that the same level of performance as men? Or less or more. But what did it look like? So, while I was fundraising and doing investments and everything else, I decided to do some research around all of this. I ended up enlisting the help of two master's students at Carnegie Mellon, my alma matter, to work with me on it. And I ended up reading, I think, something in the range of 600 existing research reports. Talking to the professors that were doing the research on campuses around the country. Talking to VCs. Talking to women who had founded venture capital firms previously. That had in most cases, Frankly not been successful, because they were funds that focused exclusively on women. And I was trying to understand what happened. What why didn't that work? What was wrong with the strategies? And I learned so much. It was pretty overwhelming. A lot of that is in that paper. If anyone wants to find it, they can go to our website and just go to Illuminate Ventures or just illuminate.com/whitepaper That's a great domain, by the way. But you know it was a labor of love And one where after I did the research, just to be honest, I was never planning to write a white paper. But I wanted the data for myself. I put it into a PowerPoint. I shared it with my advisory board at one of our advisory meetings. And they said, "Well, you have to write white paper." And I said, "I don't write white papers." And anyway, they insisted I finally did it with some help from these students. And we had a phenomenal reaction. Because what we found and what we discussed was the really high performance of women when they were funded. And the fact that so many more than ever in the past were qualified, had the entrepreneurial skills, had the entrepreneurial desire, had the right training, education, work experience, everything. And yet many of them not only were being funded, but when they were it was at a smaller level of funding [--] table. So, it was an interesting paper. Then following that just 18 months ago, we published a new report that focused more on gender differences in existing entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. And we're right now finishing up our latest in this series, I guess. Now, and I guess I can call it a series of unintentional white papers that is focused on students. And in particular on MBA students. And how they think about entrepreneurship and venture capital. Fascinating. Fascinating. And I mean. And really papers are sort of considered a hallmark of understanding the gender differences in entrepreneurship and in venture capital. Cindy, you know, I'd love to get your take on entrepreneurship right. Before we started this talk, you're starting to tell me how awesome it is to be able to be a young entrepreneur today. You know, it makes me feel good about me being a young entrepreneur. So here's the reality. It doesn't matter if you're young or old from a chronological perspective, but if you are thinking entrepreneurially, if you are creative, if you are innovative, if you dare to take your ideas and put them in front of other people and risk rejection, risk them saying no, and gather that feedback and build something meaningful from it. I'm not sure there's any better feeling that you can possibly have. It could stretch if it's just so rewarding. It's such an exciting thing to be able to be an entrepreneur. So, before you mentioned the word chutzpah. Which is quite possibly my favorite word ever. Talk to me a little bit about chutzpah. What does that mean to you and why? Why is that an integral part of being an entrepreneur? Yeah. So, some time ago, someone asked me, "What do you think is the definition of an entrepreneur?" And I said, "I think it's someone who's able to look at insurmountable obstacles and choose consciously, knowingly to ignore them." Not stupidly. Not pretending they don't exist. But choosing to ignore them. That's chutzpah. That's being able to have the ability to put your concerns and worries aside and take the opportunity to put yourself if you are, you're really putting yourself out there. Your ego is out there. Because it's your idea. It's your product. And your energy that's going into it. And then being a great leader, a strong enough leader to convey that to a whole team of people. The best people you can find that want to follow you in meeting that ambition and reaching that goal. That's more than  that want. That's leadership as well. But it's the combination of those two. I think that it can make for a great entrepreneur. 100%. I keep hearing that it takes somebody that crazy to forego a good salary as an engineer or something. And decide to go and run after a crazy idea that could possibly make the world a better place or change the world or move the needle in some way. But having to go through those obstacles and more than just ignoring it. But actually tackling them and getting excited every day, tackling them. I often talk to my wonderful girlfriend about how excited we are that we have people telling us that what we're doing is not going to succeed or it's just not right. And we get excited by this feeling that, yes, we're going against the crowd, we're going against what people are telling us, because we innately believe that what we're doing is right. And that it's going to work. And even if we fail, that's okay. Because  just that excitement and the energy we get all along is just worth everything. Cindy, what are you really passionate about? Today, you wake up every day, you look at companies, you're investing, you're doing all sorts of things. What what are you really excited about? Oh, my gosh. You know, I think that I love the work that I do. If it doesn't show, I don't know how to explain it. But I love the fact that we have the opportunity to build long term relationships with founders. I mentioned two of the founders and I sat on their boards for 10 years. It's a remarkable opportunity when I stood with the others on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. And my founders, the original founders of Xactly. Were up there on the balcony and ringing the bell. I started crying. You know, I started crying and somebody said to me, "Well, is it the money?" "No, for god-sake". But it is definitely not that old. You've seen them when they just had a slide deck and an MVP, right? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. No, I'm excited and passionate about a number of different things in life. And in some of it is how our lives are changing because of the crisis that everyone is facing today. The innovation that's coming out of that. The heartfelt sympathy that people are able to share and express and help one another. In times like this, you see the best side of people. Right. And how they step up. I just think that  work will change. How we all work, how we all learn is changing so rapidly. Because of limitations being and restrictions being placed on how we can work together. And I think the innovation that is going to come out of this is going to be-- I can't wait. You bring so much optimism into it. I love it. Cindy, right before we go, I want to thank you again for your time. It's so generous of you. You have so much going on. And really, I really appreciate you taking the time for this. I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. And then I'm going to let you continue running this awesome venture. Wow. I would say entrepreneurial. I would say I could use two words for this. High integrity. Okay. And yeah, Passionate. I love it. Entrepreneurial, High Integrity, and Passionate Cindy, toda raba. Thank you very much. I didn't, I want to also talk about J-Ventures that we're both a part of. We didn't get to that. But I look forward to learning with you on our work through the fund. And thank you for all the support. And yeah, good luck with everything. And I can't wait to see this optimism play out in real life in the years to come. Thank you so much, Michael. Take care. Bye bye. Bye bye.
