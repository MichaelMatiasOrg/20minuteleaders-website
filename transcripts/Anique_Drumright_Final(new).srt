1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,720
What do our end users actually want?

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,120
Are we making it better?

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,160
Are we building a platform

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,840
that will stand up?

5
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,400
What is right? What is that?

6
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,080
What are we doing?

7
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,760
Why are we doing it?

8
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,600
How does it connect to our vision?

9
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,120
And then it's ultimately like,

10
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,300
are we delivering it?

11
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:43,760
I'm so glad to have you here.

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,320
All the way from Uber,

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,320
TripActions, now Loom,

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,760
and Teach for America before.

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,960
I can't wait to talk about Product,

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,400
VP of Product roles,

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,560
and really, your insights

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,000
into those various industries.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,280
But before we start on all of that,

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,200
I want to go all the way back

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,920
to Georgetown,

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,080
you're playing rugby.

23
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,200
And how that has

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,640
you know, hinted towards your life

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,480
as VP of Product?

26
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,720
I mean, I've been a big believer

27
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,560
in team sports in my entire childhood.

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
So, I've played more soccer

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,080
in my lifetime than rugby.

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,320
And then I went to college

31
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,080
and I just wanted

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,080
to pick up something new,

33
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,160
be part of a team sport.

34
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,360
So, I found myself up

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,400
on the rugby team on my freshman year.

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,080
It was super fun.

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,720
I still remember my first try.

38
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,200
It was like, I caught the ball

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,600
and I just remember the coach be like,

40
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:29,480
"Run, run, run."

41
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,810
And I'm like, "I'm running."

42
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:32,960
It's great. You have no idea what you do

43
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,280
and you're like, "I wish to do my best."

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,720
"I'll be sprinting."

45
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,280
We don't have much rugby in Israel.

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,040
But rugby is the sport where eventually

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,049
just everybody is piling

48
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,120
on top of each other over this, you know,

49
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,520
cone-shaped ball. Right?

50
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:48,920
Yeah. It's like huge in,

51
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,600
it's huge in Australia and South Africa.

52
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,240
It's pretty popular in New York as well.

53
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,880
But anyways, so then after college,

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,040
I really wanted to do something

55
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,560
that mattered.

56
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,440
And I just thought, Teach for America

57
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,160
would be a great place to contribute.

58
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,760
I had had the joys of like

59
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,200
a great public education system.

60
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:13,360
And obviously I went to a really strong

61
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,040
private university for college.

62
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,520
And I just, I wanted to contribute.

63
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,760
And I wanted to do something

64
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,400
with high levels of ownership

65
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,360
and something that mattered.

66
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,800
And so, I was lucky to be selected

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,960
to be part of Teach for America.

68
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,800
So, what is Teach for America?

69
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,200
What is the sort of impact you're trying

70
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,960
to make on the public education space?

71
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,360
Yeah, sorry, that's a great question.

72
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,040
I should start there.

73
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,360
So, Teach for America is,

74
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,200
it's been around for over 25 years now.

75
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,320
It is a non-profit

76
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,480
that takes high performing leaders

77
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,720
from quite a bit directly

78
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,720
out of undergraduate university.

79
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,040
But some put collegiate

80
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,800
and places them

81
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,000
into high need school districts.

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,320
So, the public education system

83
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,120
in the United States

84
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,560
does have a teacher shortage

85
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,480
and a teacher recruitment shortage.

86
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,040
And so, I partners

87
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,400
with high performing leaders

88
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,320
puts them through a distinct training.

89
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,280
And then you work in high need schools.

90
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,120
And so, what were your various roles?

91
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,520
Because you've done quite a few things

92
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,360
within Teach for America.

93
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,840
But it's not like you came in and said,

94
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,680
"Okay, I'm going to be a teacher,

95
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,440
I'm going to help others

96
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,520
in one capacity."

97
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,560
But you really branched out

98
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,800
and did quite a few different things.

99
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,120
And I'm especially curious for that

100
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,920
because, you know, looking from your

101
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,880
journey from an outsider,

102
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,000
you're saying, okay, you wanted to go

103
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,840
study in sort of politics government

104
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,720
in Georgetown.

105
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,760
And then you go into Teach for America.

106
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,920
And then you find yourself, you know,

107
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,520
going straight into high tech

108
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,120
at full speed,

109
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,880
both at really big companies like Uber,

110
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,245
then to medium size companies

111
00:03:43,246 --> 00:03:45,160
like hyper growth, like TripActions,

112
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,000
and now to Loom,

113
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,880
which is more of a startup scene. Right?

114
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,160
So, I'm really curious

115
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,040
to hear about the journey

116
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,320
and how you sort of paved this road.

117
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,280
Yeah. I mean,

118
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:58,320
so, a core belief of Teach for America

119
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,960
is "teaching is leadership".

120
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,880
And I think that, I didn't know

121
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,160
at the time that like,

122
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
learning about teaching

123
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,400
and working at Teach for America

124
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,280
was preparing me in many ways

125
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,120
for what I do now.

126
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,600
You learn, how do you get people excited

127
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,000
to go after big goals?

128
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,760
How do you break it down

129
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
into medium goals?

130
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,120
How do you build a culture?

131
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,560
How do you keep going

132
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,360
even when things get hard?

133
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,160
And like, the results are coming in

134
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,560
and you need to change course.

135
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,682
Like that is all, I mean,

136
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:31,240
those are some of the many things

137
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,240
that product organizations do.

138
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,360
And it's the same in a classroom.

139
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,840
And so, I think

140
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,440
it was a really good foundation

141
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,400
in terms of building ownership,

142
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,800
taking tough blows.

143
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,760
Teaching is so hard,

144
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,040
and then continuing to keep going.

145
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,600
And when I left Teach for America,

146
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,160
I had joined the team in Dallas

147
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,960
and had been working

148
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,280
on developing Proofpoint schools with,

149
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,440
sort of attracting school leaders

150
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,640
and high caliber teachers,

151
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,720
and in trying to work with the district

152
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,080
to make Proofpoint schools.

153
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,560
But I just wanted to,

154
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,440
I was really young and you know,

155
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,120
things were moving

156
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,760
really fast, career wise.

157
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,040
And I just realized that I wanted

158
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,320
to experience something different.

159
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,640
I wanted to challenge my brain

160
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,000
in different ways.

161
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,080
So, I tried to applied for Uber,

162
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
got into Uber

163
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,840
and then kind of navigated the company

164
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,360
to get to what I was like,

165
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,680
ultimately more interested in,

166
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,600
which was on the product side.

167
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,680
And then from there,

168
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,480
I joined TripActions.

169
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,360
And the way that I found TripActions was,

170
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,440
I basically went through

171
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,280
a process of like,

172
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,840
Okay, who are VCs I believe in.

173
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,920
I have to understand the problem.

174
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,440
Like, I want to be excited

175
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,160
by the problem.

176
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,800
And then I met Ariel and Ilan,

177
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,880
and then it was kind off to the races.

178
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,280
And I had also looked for startups

179
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,120
that had ex Uber executives.

180
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,160
You know, Uber is a mixed bag.

181
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,440
You know, 2014, 2015, 2016,

182
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,520
Uber, they're like highs and lows

183
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,880
from a culture standpoint.

184
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,320
But I do think it was rigorous

185
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,680
and bold and courageous.

186
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,680
And there were, you know,

187
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,080
negative attributes as well.

188
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,360
That coin is double sided.

189
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,640
But like, when I first joined there,

190
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,840
we all believed in it so much.

191
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,960
And I knew that I wanted

192
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,480
to work at a company,

193
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,720
that that belief was like fully there.

194
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,800
Right.

195
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,960
And so, then I joined TripActions

196
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,520
when we were 40 people.

197
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,040
I had no idea that it would like, scale.

198
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,200
And so, yeah, I was

199
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,400
the first product manager.

200
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,880
Amazing. So, first product manager,

201
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,520
but actually pretty quickly

202
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,880
then becoming Head of Product

203
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,680
and then VP of Product.

204
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,520
And how many people were TripActions

205
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,320
by the time that you left?

206
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,200
So, when I joined,

207
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,960
we were a series-A, 40 people.

208
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,560
When I left, we were 1200

209
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,120
valued at four billion.

210
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,760
And my team went from just me,

211
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,720
to then running the design

212
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,880
or really building the design

213
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,560
and product organization,

214
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,080
to about 27, split between

215
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,840
Palo Alto and Amsterdam.

216
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,520
Unbelievable.

217
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,720
Why Amsterdam?

218
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,200
That was more

219
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,960
of an engineering-driven decision.

220
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,000
There had been another, well no.

221
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,440
Amsterdam,

222
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,360
because from an operations standpoint,

223
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,400
we had set up a support team.

224
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,520
And then our CTO had flown out there

225
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,920
and had met with a startup

226
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,960
that was very talented

227
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,160
in the travel space.

228
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,360
And so, then he made the decision

229
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,760
from an engineering perspective,

230
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,920
we're going to hire there.

231
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,720
There's also like

232
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,680
a ton of tax incentives in Amsterdam.

233
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,560
It's like Amsterdam and Dublin,

234
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,200
very interesting for startup

235
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,080
But anyways, so, it was mostly like

236
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,520
the operations team had set up

237
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,440
and then our CTO had gone out

238
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,760
and had met like a team

239
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,200
of pretty talented engineers.

240
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,120
And so then, it just became

241
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,600
kind of a natural decision.

242
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,920
Also, because TripActions

243
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,040
is both a product

244
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,720
and an operations company.

245
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:04,920
Right.

246
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,040
And good for your tech team

247
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,920
to be close with the support team

248
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,160
or your operations team.

249
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
Your customer success team,

250
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,600
your sales team, there's just a ton

251
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,520
of empathy that's developed.

252
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,880
So, it was kind of a win all around,

253
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,040
both from a product

254
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,720
and engineering and a support perspective.

255
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,440
What were some

256
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,520
of the most both challenging

257
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
and exhilarating things

258
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,000
about moving from a,

259
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,800
you know, one person team really

260
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,880
to now, almost a 30 person team?

261
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,640
But more importantly than that,

262
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,320
being a part of the incubation

263
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,920
of what would become a 1200 person,

264
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,720
four billion dollar company,

265
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,080
which I'm assuming

266
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,720
as one of the first people

267
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,600
working on product in the company,

268
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,200
you've gotten to see really

269
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,840
the vision and strategy

270
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,440
unfold along the way,

271
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,960
as you made those transitions.

272
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,560
So, I'd love to sort of pick your brain

273
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,560
and fast forward during these years.

274
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,320
But really understand,

275
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,880
what were some of those insights

276
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,320
that you gained throughout this time?

277
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,960
I mean, I think

278
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,920
the first ones that come to mind,

279
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,960
and since you didn't send me

280
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,000
the questions ahead of time,

281
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,640
I have to just go off the cuff.

282
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,520
The first is like,

283
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:10,440
as you begin to build a team,

284
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,120
the people you bring in are so exciting.

285
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,520
Right.

286
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,240
I think about some

287
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,720
of the product managers

288
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,880
that I hired, that I mentored,

289
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,840
that I learned from,

290
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,000
and it's just so fun, you know.

291
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,720
Yeah.

292
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,240
And I think,

293
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,240
that is just like a very inspiring piece

294
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,560
of a company growing.

295
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:33,120
And then I think the second piece

296
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,480
from a product perspective

297
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,760
that I learned in spades

298
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,720
at TripActions is like,

299
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,040
you should always be responding

300
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,640
to the market.

301
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,640
Right.

302
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,160
Like if you want to be winning

303
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,320
and if you want to be a true partner

304
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
to your customers,

305
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,800
because TripActions and Loom

306
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,960
are both B2B2C, like you need

307
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,920
to be both over delivering

308
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,320
and also have a pulse

309
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,600
on how things are changing.

310
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:57,800
Right.

311
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,960
So, how do you then, as VP of Product

312
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,880
have that pulse?

313
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,760
How do you wake up every day,

314
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,600
and by the way,

315
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,880
one of the questions

316
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,680
that before we start, you're asking,

317
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,000
"How do you edit these videos?

318
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,640
What software you use?"

319
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,880
I guess that's part

320
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,800
of the VP product mentality

321
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,240
of constantly doing that market research.

322
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,120
But what is your,

323
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,000
sort of engaged responsibility

324
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,280
with the market?

325
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
How do you tangibly go

326
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,560
about executing on it every single day

327
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,000
as you're aligning the strategy?

328
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And when Ariel and Ilan are saying,

329
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,777
"Okay, we'll Anique,

330
00:10:26,778 --> 00:10:27,800
what is the next product

331
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,720
we should build?"

332
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,840
then, how do you even go about thinking

333
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,360
of that new and innovative vision?

334
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,650
It's a good question.

335
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:39,560
I mean, I think part of it is

336
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,480
being pretty diligent about always

337
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,880
being in front of customers.

338
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,840
So, like, if I look at my week

339
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,760
and I'm not like

340
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,680
in the field at least twice,

341
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,600
I'll like, being

342
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,720
customer success in sales

343
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,120
and be like,

344
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,120
this is a lonely week.

345
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,840
Like I need to get out there.

346
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,040
And what does that mean, Anique?

347
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,600
What does that mean

348
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,720
to get in front of that customer?

349
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,280
Is it literally, you picking up the phone

350
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,160
and calling customers?

351
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,920
Is that you going to meet ups or Zooms?

352
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,000
I push in

353
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:09,040
on customer calls and sales calls.

354
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,200
And I also, if we're going to lose a deal

355
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,800
or if this was like,

356
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,160
if there's something at risk,

357
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,520
I want to know from it.

358
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,280
Because, one, it's my responsibility,

359
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,160
but also because

360
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,760
there's so much learning to happen.

361
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,560
But still about this, you know,

362
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,280
jumping in, being responsible of them,

363
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,880
they're still learning,

364
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,520
that's part of both leadership,

365
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,240
but it's also a part of, you

366
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,520
understanding that it's a process.

367
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,880
And, you know, you have

368
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,160
to learn from every experience.

369
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,480
So, from your insights,

370
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,040
what are some

371
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,320
of the most important things

372
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,680
that a product manager

373
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,120
can take with them

374
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,360
as they're building other product

375
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,400
and strategy and growing in the ranks,

376
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,200
as regards to a company's product?

377
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,520
I mean, I think the first

378
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,080
is like curiosity.

379
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,800
I think one of the mistakes

380
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,960
that product managers,

381
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,160
that it's funny when I join

382
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,560
as a customer into product meetings,

383
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,720
that I face sometimes is product managers

384
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,520
being defensive of their product.

385
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,890
You're seeing uncomfortable, right?

386
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:09,463
You're like, "Oh, it's criticizing."

387
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:11,770
And so, that art of listening

388
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:14,440
and balancing being empathetic

389
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,280
and being genuinely curious,

390
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,040
while also taking ownership

391
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,600
and taking responsibility of the product

392
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,920
that you've developed,

393
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,440
I think it's a really, you know,

394
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,520
it's a balance that everyone

395
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,440
is trying to constantly get better at.

396
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:29,720
Right.

397
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,280
And there's definitely times

398
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,520
where I hop up calls where I'm like,

399
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,800
I didn't listen enough.

400
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,640
Or I should have asked

401
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,160
more open ended questions than I did.

402
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,760
What is the difference between

403
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,480
open ended versus closed ended questions,

404
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,080
from a product management perspective?

405
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,000
So, let's say that I'm now, you know,

406
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,800
I'm the founder of an early stage company

407
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,040
and I'm trying to get my validation

408
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,160
or I'm trying to get some insight

409
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,960
into whatever I'm building,

410
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,760
what would be a key indicator

411
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,320
whether I'm asking the right questions?

412
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,040
Because I think that

413
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,080
that's both something

414
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,600
that I need to get better at.

415
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,760
But I think that it's also something

416
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,400
that I see quite frequently

417
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,760
that people don't ask enough

418
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,800
open ended questions

419
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
when they're doing their research.

420
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,440
It's like asking,

421
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,880
do you use X tool versus

422
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,480
tell me about

423
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,160
how you edit your videos?

424
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,560
Right?

425
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,360
You're going to get

426
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,760
so much more information.

427
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,160
You're going to learn

428
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,720
about their workflow,

429
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,360
what their technique is.

430
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,040
And you want to know

431
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,200
all of that information.

432
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,100
You want to like

433
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:30,320
be consistently learning about it.

434
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,560
Right.

435
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,640
Because that will

436
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,040
inspire future decisions.

437
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,200
I think building that gut

438
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
and that instinct is so important.

439
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,440
And we've talked a lot

440
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,320
about customer calls,

441
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,640
but it's also like, you know, one of my,

442
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:46,240
like strongest product managers

443
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,800
in my current team

444
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,760
is like, we should just be using

445
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,440
different video services every week.

446
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,760
Just like constantly be like

447
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,560
just building our gut.

448
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,800
Because I don't think

449
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,840
you can be curious enough.

450
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,960
Right.

451
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,840
And also, like,

452
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,800
what are other products

453
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,320
that you're using daily

454
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,640
or that other people are using

455
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,120
and what makes you love them.

456
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,760
Can you be conscious of that.

457
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,120
When you're signing on to you're like,

458
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,120
we are using Riverside.FM,

459
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,200
there was I clicked a button

460
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,480
and there was a great user feedback.

461
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,760
So, I took a picture and screenshot it

462
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,600
and sent it to PM.

463
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,080
So, that's why it took me a second to get on.

464
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,280
Right?

465
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,880
It's like, can you constantly

466
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,480
be building that instinct

467
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,760
of what makes great product?

468
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,960
Right.

469
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,040
Because different people

470
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,320
are really strong at different things.

471
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,320
So, it's like what's going on

472
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,760
in the actual market, right,

473
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,000
like the investor market, competitors?

474
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,200
What's going on with your customers,

475
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,840
to your sales,

476
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
to your support team?

477
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,920
Like make sure you're getting in there.

478
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,640
And you actually should be on the calls.

479
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,480
And then the third piece

480
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,440
is just like learning

481
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,440
from different types of products.

482
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,880
100%. And I think, by the way,

483
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,480
that one of the things that I enjoy most

484
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,560
about these open ended questions,

485
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,760
even more than quantity of information,

486
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,520
it's the surprise element

487
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,360
that when I hear something

488
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,299
that I didn't expect

489
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,240
or that I thought that,

490
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,280
that wasn't going to come out

491
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,000
of their mouth, and all of a sudden

492
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,480
it opens up a whole new world to me

493
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,000
that if I ask them more

494
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,040
of a closed ended question,

495
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,280
I'm sort of bringing

496
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,760
my preconceived notions

497
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,560
into the answer.

498
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,400
And it becomes almost

499
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,280
a rhetorical question

500
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,520
where I'm guiding them towards

501
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,880
a specific response,

502
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,480
or at least I'm barricading them

503
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,638
to some vertical

504
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,240
that they have to, you know,

505
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,640
they have to reside in.

506
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,560
Whereas the open ended,

507
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,440
I find that really, I'm getting

508
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,720
a breadth of different world views

509
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,640
and things that I really didn't expect.

510
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,520
But Anique, I want to make sure

511
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,840
that we have also enough time

512
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,800
to talk about what you're doing now.

513
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,960
Because I think that,

514
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,701
yeah, go ahead.

515
00:15:31,702 --> 00:15:32,760
And I feel that I didn't answer

516
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,680
your original question.

517
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,360
Because I got too excited

518
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,280
about the curiosity.

519
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,640
To me, it's like in terms

520
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,040
of great product management,

521
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,120
I think it comes down to like,

522
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,960
curiosity, leadership and execution.

523
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,800
I think that you need

524
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:44,280
all three of those things.

525
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,960
If you have execution without leadership,

526
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,200
then the teams aren't going to be happy.

527
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,600
You're only going to execute once.

528
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,520
But those are the three to me.

529
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,040
And obviously, if you have curiosity,

530
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,200
but you don't have the execution,

531
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,600
then you're going to write

532
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,040
some great confluence papers,

533
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,550
but you're not going to end up

534
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:00,160
building a product people love.

535
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,320
But Anique, today you're working

536
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,240
as VP of product

537
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,800
in one of the startups

538
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,120
that I enjoy most, mainly

539
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,320
because I use it probably

540
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,640
50 or 60 times a day,

541
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,240
with pretty much everything that I do,

542
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,960
which is Loom.

543
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,640
Loom has developed quite a bit

544
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,120
since I began using it.

545
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,440
And I've been really,

546
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,520
really enjoying the product.

547
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
So, when you talk to me

548
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,880
about this customer delight

549
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,360
and the feedbacks that also

550
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,560
the user is getting and you're getting,

551
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,960
I can really see that in the product

552
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,120
that you're building there.

553
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,800
So, as the VP of product,

554
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,760
tell me a little bit about what Loom is,

555
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,520
and what are some of your thoughts

556
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,480
behind building now a product?

557
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,320
I'm pretty sure,

558
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,560
on a smaller scale now

559
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,600
than with Uber and TripActions, right?

560
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,840
But now you're seeing

561
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,560
that fast growth as VP of Product.

562
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
Yeah.

563
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,720
So, Loom is a video messaging product

564
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,560
that essentially allows you

565
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,160
to instantly create a video message

566
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,760
and get a link generated

567
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,280
and share it to other people.

568
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,200
And the reason why I joined

569
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,000
is I had a tremendously difficult time

570
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,320
giving design feedback

571
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,480
to the team in Amsterdam

572
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,120
when I worked at TripActions.

573
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,680
I would sometimes sound like

574
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,160
overly harsh over Slack.

575
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,120
And with time zones, you'd have like

576
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,640
two hours to work.

577
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,258
And so, Loom enabled me just to create

578
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:18,240
very quick, like, feedback loop.

579
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,560
Yes.

580
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,360
And like, the intent

581
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,320
and the effectiveness

582
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,760
and the efficiency of Loom

583
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,560
was like just a magical experience.

584
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,240
And I think, ultimately,

585
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,200
and then if you ask yourself

586
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,400
a few questions as to like,

587
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,760
why is it so effective?

588
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,360
Why is it so efficient?

589
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:35,600
Right.

590
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,800
Like the original form

591
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,760
of communication was storytelling.

592
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,000
Right?

593
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,880
What are we doing right now?

594
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,800
We're just telling stories

595
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,040
back and forth.

596
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,840
Loom is an incredible, like product

597
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,480
to put that kind of storytelling,

598
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,320
that human voice, that efficiency,

599
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,040
that effectiveness, like in the forefront

600
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,120
of how you work,

601
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,960
especially in a distributed work setting.

602
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,240
Which I think, like we

603
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,120
all currently are in, and in the future

604
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:05,280
we'll be in a totally different way.

605
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
So, it's a little bit about Loom

606
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,880
And a little bit about

607
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,600
what your role as VP or Product.

608
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,400
Is it exactly the same responsibilities

609
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,520
you've had in TripActions, for example?

610
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,240
What are some key differences between,

611
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,320
you know, that a VP product might have

612
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,760
in one company versus the other?

613
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,600
Because obviously, the title is the same.

614
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,320
But I imagine that

615
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,720
the scope of responsibility

616
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,800
is pretty different

617
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,600
amongst different organizations.

618
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,800
I think the responsibility between TripActions

619
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,560
and Loom feels pretty similar.

620
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,720
The major difference is design sets out.

621
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,240
Like we have a design leader

622
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,080
that runs the design organization.

623
00:18:39,081 --> 00:18:40,200
But I think, ultimately,

624
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,880
the responsibility is, what are we doing,

625
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,800
why are we doing it,

626
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
is it the right thing.

627
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,440
Right.

628
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:46,880
Like, what we ultimately believe

629
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,400
is our responsibility to our customers.

630
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,680
Right?

631
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,560
Like, what do our end users actually want?

632
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,960
Are we making it better?

633
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,000
Are we building a platform

634
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,680
that will stand up?

635
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,280
What is right? What is that?

636
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:57,920
What are we doing?

637
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,600
Why are we doing it?

638
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,440
How does it connect to our vision?

639
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,960
And then it's ultimately like,

640
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,360
are we delivering it?

641
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,520
And delivering it by like,

642
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,040
when we said we were going to

643
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,520
at the quality we said we were.

644
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,520
And then how can you build

645
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,200
an organization in a team

646
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,560
that is constantly learning

647
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,160
and constantly improving.

648
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,720
So, we just get better and better

649
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,480
at this dance.

650
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:18,680
Right.

651
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,410
And so, you joined Loom

652
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:21,840
in August of 2020,

653
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,840
pretty much at some peak

654
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,440
of the pandemic.

655
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,760
There were so many peaks that,

656
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,640
you know, every day was almost

657
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,800
the peak of something.

658
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,160
And so, you joined Loom,

659
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,760
remote collaboration,

660
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,240
becoming, you know, diving deep

661
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,320
into this relatively new industry

662
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,720
that is very different

663
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,600
from your previous industries.

664
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,000
And so, what are some of your thoughts

665
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,400
behind the remote collaboration,

666
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,440
the things that you're observing

667
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,520
within Loom that you've gotten to know

668
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,280
over the past, I guess,

669
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,360
four or five months or so?

670
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
So, I do think

671
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,520
there are some similarities

672
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,960
between TripActions and Loom

673
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,640
in the sense that they're both B2B2C.

674
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,480
So, you're prior may be a company,

675
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,440
but ultimately both products rely

676
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,800
on your end user loving it. Right?

677
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,160
And that's like

678
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,040
kind of connected to Uber those roots.

679
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,160
And so, being very connected

680
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,280
to the consumers is really important.

681
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,640
But I think, you know,

682
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,280
when I joined Loom, I was really excited

683
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,320
about the effectiveness and efficiency.

684
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,800
Like, Loom can just help people connect,

685
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,240
especially like global workforces.

686
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,000
I think as I've

687
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,760
you know, gotten to know the product

688
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,440
and understand

689
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,160
Joe and Vinay's fuller vision

690
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,280
and experience the product myself,

691
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,800
it's incredible how much the Loom product

692
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,720
has the potential to really elevate

693
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,000
the culture of a distributed workforce--

694
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,800
I completely agree.

695
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,680
--in that cultural aspect,

696
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,640
and what it can contribute.

697
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,600
It makes your culture

698
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,440
more effective and more efficient.

699
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,360
But it also makes the culture

700
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,560
more rich, more human, more lively.

701
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,760
And I think until I started using Loom

702
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,680
in the way that I do

703
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,440
and starting to talk to customers

704
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,480
that are using it in that manner,

705
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,800
it's just an incredible,

706
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,240
like the potential of Loom

707
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,080
is just so huge.

708
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,400
And I have to say, Anique, that I have

709
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,480
to testify to this myself.

710
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,280
I have quite a few people

711
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,840
that I work with across the seas

712
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,960
in various countries.

713
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,120
A lot of them are dependent

714
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
on my feedback on a daily basis,

715
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,480
you know, every few hours.

716
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,120
And then the difference between moving

717
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,200
from a Slack feedback

718
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,160
or a WhatsApp feedback,

719
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,680
to now me recording

720
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,760
a 15, 20 second snippet,

721
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,520
of me demonstrating on the screen

722
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,600
my feedback, with my bubble showing there,

723
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,120
and me smiling and talking

724
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,040
or even just being casual,

725
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,560
it changes the whole relationship.

726
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,480
It changes the dynamic.

727
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
And I'm seeing it

728
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,720
just to boost the productivity

729
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,960
on all fronts.

730
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,920
And I think and again,

731
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,040
I love what you guys are doing.

732
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,880
So, thank you for really making

733
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,760
my work better and more collaborative.

734
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,360
And for many of my friends

735
00:21:59,360 --> 00:21:59,880
and colleagues.

736
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,000
I know that a lot of people

737
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
that are using it.

738
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,120
I don't want to take up

739
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,143
much more of your time because I know

740
00:22:04,144 --> 00:22:05,120
that you're already running late

741
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,920
to your next thing.

742
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,280
But I really appreciate you

743
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,600
taking the time to do this.

744
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,400
My last question,

745
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,680
which is my favorite one, is three words

746
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,320
that you would use to describe yourself.

747
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,520
I think maybe three would probably

748
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,320
be greedy, loyal and adventurous.

749
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,120
I love it.

750
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,480
Anique, thank you very, very much.

751
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,680
This was wonderful.

752
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,840
And stay safe and stay healthy.

753
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,640
