1
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,000
All right.

2
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,280
Isaac, so good to have you

3
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,150
on 20 Minute Leaders.

4
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,320
Thank you so much for giving

5
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,080
your precious precious time.

6
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,320
It's a pleasure to be here.

7
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,120
Wonderful.

8
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,760
So, if I start going over all

9
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,320
the things that you've done,

10
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,880
I won't be able to let you speak

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,640
for these 20 minutes.

12
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll just give a very brief overview

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,440
and we'll fill in the rest of the

14
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,320
details over the next 20 minutes.

15
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,560
Founded a startup,

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,440
sold it to Bank of America,

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,320
Senior Vice President of Bank of America,

18
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,040
and then went on to be director

19
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,280
of various companies,

20
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,640
moved on to venture capital,

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,680
partner at Lightspeed Ventures,

22
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,080
one of the most popular ventures

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,240
here in the Bay Area.

24
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,560
Now founded MizMaa Ventures,

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,720
investing in early stage startups in Israel

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,360
and also the involvement

27
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,280
with J-Ventures.

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,360
And we've just mentioned

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:42,920
the love for Oded

30
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:44,640
and the capitalistic Kibbutz,

31
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,520
and bringing together both Israelis

32
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,040
and Jewish people from around the world

33
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,080
into this mission.

34
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,880
Did I get a good overview?

35
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,760
I have nothing to add.

36
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,840
It was great talking to you.

37
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,280
Thank you for your time.

38
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,960
I just saved you 14 minutes.

39
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,800
But I did forget one thing

40
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,920
that I promised we talk about,

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
which is the fact that you're one

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,760
of the largest Kosher wine collectors

43
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,840
in the world.

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,160
A real passion of mine,

45
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,000
something that I've been doing

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,680
for many many years.

47
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,600
We did our first winery in 1989

48
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,760
when we were living in Sacramento.

49
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,320
And maybe there were 10 Kosher wines

50
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,680
you can choose from.

51
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,280
And my partner at that time,

52
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,200
Art Huntley, came up with the saying,

53
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,480
"Would you boil your orange juice?"

54
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,160
So we went out to make really

55
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,960
great wines and eventually sold

56
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,640
it to Herzog the largest producer

57
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,520
of kosher one in the world.

58
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,320
And I've been doing wine projects

59
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,360
both here and in Israel

60
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,760
for the last 25 years,

61
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,680
focused around drinking and drinking

62
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,680
and focused around wine tastings

63
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,360
and position in the industry

64
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,560
to be in a position way better than it was

65
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,200
10 or 15 years ago here.

66
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,760
Isaac, you're one of the most world renowned

67
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,160
entrepreneurs, investors

68
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,040
and tech executives.

69
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,720
What's the deal with wine?

70
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,640
Why wine?

71
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,720
You know, one of the things

72
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,320
that really drives me is,

73
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,920
and we can talk about this a little later,

74
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,280
is being a connector.

75
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,080
How do you get people together?

76
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,720
And I think that wine,

77
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,000
because it holds the two components

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,440
of being Kedushah

79
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,160
It's both holy,

80
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,960
so the Friday night table,

81
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,440
which is where every Friday

82
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,360
night we have 20 people

83
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,560
for Shabbat dinner.

84
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,360
Young people, older people,

85
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,320
yeshiva students, Stanford students.

86
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,720
We have all the time.

87
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,160
And wine is that connector.

88
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,040
It's the middle man.

89
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,160
And you can take a non Jewish,

90
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,720
a president of Daimler to Israel

91
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,000
and do a wine dinner in his honor,

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,720
which we've done, of course.

93
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,560
And he walks away saying

94
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,280
"Israel is great,

95
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,240
but the wine in Israel

96
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,560
is even greater"

97
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,600
So, I find wine is really

98
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,720
a common, for the most part,

99
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,880
it's a real common bond

100
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,520
between people of the whole world.

101
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,640
Young, old, middle aged and globally.

102
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,160
And so, I have a good palate.

103
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,280
I mean, there aren't a lot of things

104
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,600
I have good, but a good palate I have.

105
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,960
And so, I started collecting and making

106
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,560
and producing and drinking.

107
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,000
And it all fits together.

108
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,480
Wow. Incredible. Incredible.

109
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,120
So, how many bottles of wine

110
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,280
would you say you've produced

111
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,080
over the years?

112
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,480
Well, the better question is how

113
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,640
many do I have in my cellar

114
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,520
cause what I produced is gone.

115
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,840
In my cellar here in Oakland,

116
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,240
I have about

117
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,200
three and a half thousand bottles.

118
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
And then in Jerusalem,

119
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,560
I have about a thousand or more

120
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,280
and they're from

121
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,080
every known place on the planet.

122
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,760
And we have Spanish wines, Italian.

123
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,600
All Kosher, Spanish, Italian.

124
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,320
Obviously Israeli, California, French.

125
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,200
So, it's quite, you have to come.

126
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,960
It's quite diverse.

127
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,400
I am immediately taking

128
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,480
you up on this offer.

129
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,560
The minute I heard

130
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,880
three and a half thousand

131
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,800
bottles of wine in Oakland

132
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,960
and a thousand back in Jerusalem.

133
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,400
Yeah.

134
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,560
Just unbelievable.

135
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,640
How many of them are unique?

136
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,440
How many of them are different?

137
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,080
It's a really interesting question.

138
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,840
We make one barrel

139
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,480
of something called Harlan.

140
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,120
Harlan is hundred point Parker,

141
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,360
it's the best non-Kosher wine

142
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,640
pretty much in Napa.

143
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,800
And I have a partner and I

144
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,440
make a barrel every year.

145
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,960
So, I get twelve and a half cases.

146
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,000
So from 2004 to now,

147
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,280
that's definitely the most rare,

148
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,280
but I have some very old wines.

149
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,680
I have a beautiful cellar,

150
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,600
so I have quite a few rare bottles

151
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,200
because I have some of the great Herzogs

152
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,840
from 1996 and '98, '99

153
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,080
that are still good.

154
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,480
So, and I have the old Yardens

155
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,440
from 1984 and 2000.

156
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,800
So, I have quite a few interesting bottles.

157
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,280
Okay. I have a feeling I'm gonna enjoy

158
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,560
quite a bit coming

159
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,280
for Shabbat one night.

160
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,000
Absolutely.

161
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,000
Wonderful

162
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,160
Isaac, talk to me a little bit about

163
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,560
your role as SVP

164
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,640
at Bank of America.

165
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,000
One of the largest,

166
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,800
largest organizations,

167
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,520
very, a critical infrastructure.

168
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,280
Very different from early stage startups

169
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,720
which you're involved with now.

170
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,520
So, especially with a broad perspective

171
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,840
that you can bring now,

172
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,560
having invested in so many companies

173
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,320
and seeing the whole world

174
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,280
of tech from young to old.

175
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,760
How do you see your role

176
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,640
as SVP of Bank of America Now?

177
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,920
So, that obviously I was an SVP

178
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,360
at Bank of America a while ago,

179
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,760
and I'd like to think that

180
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,520
everything that has shaped my career,

181
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,240
unlike your generation that gets to plan,

182
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
almost everything

183
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,240
that I've done has been accidental.

184
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,880
And I say that

185
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,040
'cause my dad was a rabbi.

186
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,160
He was a rabbi in the same

187
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,960
synagogue for 52 years.

188
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,240
His father was a rabbi

189
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,440
actually died in a synagogue

190
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,920
and he was 65 years in the same shul.

191
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,480
And I had no plan,

192
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,840
to tell you the truth. I meandered.

193
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,000
I studied technology in the early days,

194
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,720
but ended up co-founding

195
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,480
a company that was pre-Internet,

196
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,920
but still had a lot of the

197
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,760
the components of Internet.

198
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,360
And we did banking software

199
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,520
application migration for banks.

200
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,120
And Bank of America bought my company.

201
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,920
So, they were my exit.

202
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,440
And as part of that exit,

203
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,680
it was very early in the Internet cycle

204
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,360
and they hadn't been doing a lot

205
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,560
in investing in or kind of partnering

206
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,400
with Internet companies.

207
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,680
So, I spent two plus years with them

208
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,040
simply helping them find

209
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,840
early stage Internet companies

210
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,000
both in the US

211
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,560
and I convinced them to go to Israel.

212
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,520
So, in 1999, 2000, I started my monthly trip

213
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,120
to Israel since then.

214
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,840
Including during the intifada.

215
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,800
And I learned a lot about

216
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,480
what do corporations want and need

217
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,960
from these early stage startups.

218
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,240
And then when I got recruited to Lightspeed,

219
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,360
it was kind of like I went to the dark side,

220
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,640
which is where entrepreneurs go to retire.

221
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,880
But it ends up, you work six times harder

222
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,560
than you ever work in your life.

223
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,120
And I was able to apply my knowledge

224
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,960
from what I learned at the bank

225
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:33,880
into Lightspeed.

226
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,200
And then again into the future investing

227
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:36,760
I've been doing.

228
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,340
So, having gone through

229
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,240
so many investments

230
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,440
and spending so many years

231
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
in so many different

232
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:43,840
venture capital firms

233
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,640
Do you have sort of an investor persona

234
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,360
of how you approach this role then

235
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,680
and the types of things

236
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,920
that you'd like to see and

237
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,520
that you don't like to see?

238
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,840
The answer is the most common answer

239
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,440
you'll ever get.

240
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,360
It's about the people.

241
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,720
So, but I would say for me, first of all,

242
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,720
because most of what I do is in Israel.

243
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,600
It's about the nexus

244
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,760
of California and Israel.

245
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,400
Very very important at the businesses

246
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,480
that we look at.

247
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,080
Now, that is all true up until MizMaa,

248
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,560
which I started in 2016,

249
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,320
'cause that's much more

250
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,720
focused on the East.

251
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,080
But up until then,

252
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,720
the vast majority of my focus

253
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,160
was really on building companies

254
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,000
in California and Israel.

255
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,840
So, great entrepreneurs,

256
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,960
for me more than anything

257
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
work ethic, it's gonna sound strange,

258
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,320
but for me, work ethic is about

259
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,160
as important as anything else

260
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,240
that I look for.

261
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,880
How quickly do I get my emails returned?

262
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,000
How quickly ... phone calls.

263
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,560
If we talk about you'd like

264
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,000
to meet someone in Company X

265
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,680
and two weeks later

266
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,280
you send me that information,

267
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,040
I'm not interested in investing in you.

268
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,600
So, that's one of my first tells

269
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,840
or first signs

270
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,960
is work ethic energy -

271
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,920
I wanna focus on this

272
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,040
because this is fascinating

273
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,640
and I don't get to talk about this often.

274
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,000
Talk to me a little bit about this.

275
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,000
The efficiency and responsiveness

276
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,040
that you're looking for

277
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,800
because this, it also seems almost

278
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,440
this is kind of a new age idea

279
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,400
that we need to be very responsive.

280
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,280
We need to be very communicative

281
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,280
and sort of all the time with our phone.

282
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,080
So, talk to me about

283
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,000
this approach of yours.

284
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,120
So, even even back to the,

285
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,000
I started in the '80s, remember?

286
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,040
But even in the '80s and the '90s,

287
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,480
if I got a phone call,

288
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,880
I returned that phone call.

289
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,280
If I had a list of to dos

290
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,600
to do for the day,

291
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,400
I didn't go to bed

292
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,360
until I finished that list of to dos.

293
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,120
And so, for me, it's been kind of my DNA

294
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,640
from the beginning.

295
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,480
But I think the problem with today

296
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,240
is that there's always

297
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,440
someone better than you.

298
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,280
There's always someone working harder.

299
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,520
There's always someone more engaged.

300
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,480
And at the end of the day,

301
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,800
the person's gonna win that race.

302
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,120
Clearly, it's about intellect

303
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,160
and working efficiently.

304
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,400
Obviously, that's true.

305
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,760
But there's so many people

306
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,000
who are so connected and so energetic

307
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,080
that I think

308
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,000
you have to be one step more

309
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,680
in order to really beat

310
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,520
the guy next to you

311
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,000
'cause you only have to beat

312
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,760
the person next to you.

313
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,520
It's not about you know,

314
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,000
there are five competitors.

315
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,760
You wanna be the one

316
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,680
or the one of the two that wins.

317
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,120
It's like the joke

318
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,320
that I think my father always told me

319
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,400
that if you're in a forest

320
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,200
and you're with your friend

321
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
and a bear is chasing you,

322
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,560
you don't have to outrun the bear.

323
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,080
You have to outrun your friend.

324
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,360
Yeah. And you know what?

325
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,600
That's a great story.

326
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,120
That's how I would say

327
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,280
one of the key aspects of people,

328
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,040
when I look for people,

329
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,200
that's what I'm looking for.

330
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,720
Interesting.

331
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,120
So, besides the responsiveness

332
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,600
and the clarity,

333
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,560
how they communicate,

334
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,680
are there other aspects

335
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,600
about their work ethic

336
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,040
that you're able to judge

337
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,760
along your due diligence process

338
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,200
or simply the relationship

339
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,960
that you're building with them?

340
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,480
No, obviously I

341
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,680
especially in Israel,

342
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,840
because I've been there since 2000.

343
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,880
I rely on

344
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,840
a very heavy network of people.

345
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,280
Now, your generation is

346
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,080
different than mine.

347
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,880
So, if I were to ask about

348
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,080
what unit you were in

349
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,320
and what you did there.

350
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,040
You know, the truth is

351
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,320
you can most probably trick me

352
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,000
all day long

353
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,080
because I'm just not,

354
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,760
even ... every month.

355
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,120
And so, at MizMaa, my new fund,

356
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,720
which we've been doing

357
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,600
for almost four years,

358
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,480
we have an ex Air Force pilot,

359
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,400
F-16I pilot named Yoav,

360
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,480
who will look at you

361
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,200
and in 30 seconds, know.

362
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,280
Right.

363
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,480
And then we have,

364
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,880
my oldest son who did his degree

365
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,120
at Princeton in cyber-security,

366
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,160
and my middle Ariel who just popped in

367
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,680
He looked at a thousand

368
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,200
companies last year.

369
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,760
And then we have this guy, Rick Kaplan,

370
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,640
who was the former CEO of IBM

371
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,880
in Israel, etc.

372
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,080
So, what I'm able to do is use

373
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,320
their on the ground current knowledge.

374
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
And then I could call Yoram Tietz

375
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,760
the CEO of Ernst and Young.

376
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,000
And he says, "Yes.

377
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:43,960
Now let's talk"

378
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,440
You can sit back and relax

379
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,240
with the guys who smoke cigars

380
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,320
and drink whiskey.

381
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,960
So, it's kind of like

382
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,120
a two phase approach.

383
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,800
And I'll know everything

384
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,400
there is to know about you.

385
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,560
So, that's critical

386
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,080
along with the work, energy

387
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,960
and your creativity to really help.

388
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,080
And, of course, what you're doing

389
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,280
and who the competitors are.

390
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,000
But that's traditional for everybody.

391
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,840
I think it's incredible.

392
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,680
So, today, even though all the information

393
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,880
is sort of out there and accessible

394
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,520
And all our social media profiles.

395
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,680
You know people in my generation

396
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,600
just love to use them to not brag,

397
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,000
but to showcase our professionalism

398
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,920
and that's sort of where we wish

399
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,160
the due diligence would take place.

400
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,280
You're approaching this much more personal,

401
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,520
relationship oriented place of

402
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,000
we understand the cultures

403
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,840
and we know the right people

404
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,160
and we can actually get

405
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,240
to the bottom of who you are.

406
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,280
We don't have to rely

407
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
on these more superficial titles

408
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,240
that you might give yourself

409
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,200
on LinkedIn or elsewhere.

410
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,640
It's a great summation.

411
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,560
I'll add only one thing to that.

412
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,200
What I found throughout my career,

413
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,240
but more now than ever.

414
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,440
By using some of the metrics

415
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,920
and criteria that I have

416
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,000
when the chips are down,

417
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,840
and the chips are going to be down,

418
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,960
it's you I can depend on

419
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,360
that are gonna go that extra mile,

420
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,720
spend the extra day,

421
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,440
be the extra honest versus

422
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,240
someone who'll say,

423
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,280
"I'm gonna throw in the towel"

424
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,800
So, that it all builds up

425
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,640
to not to when the times are good

426
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,400
that's pretty easy.

427
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,240
It's when the times are bad

428
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,920
I plan for it.

429
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,240
Definitely. So, you've had the pleasure

430
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,440
of seeing a few bad moments

431
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,560
in our economy.

432
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,240
During your tenure

433
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,320
as a venture capital partner,

434
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,800
both the 2008 crisis that I'm looking at,

435
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,400
but also covid-19.

436
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,520
Do you actually start seeing

437
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,600
these aspects come out

438
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,520
in the entrepreneurs

439
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,440
that you've invested in

440
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,000
and how they deal differently

441
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,880
with these crises,

442
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,800
and whether their leadership emerges

443
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,080
or sort of succumbs?

444
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Oh, it's like after

445
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,880
the first hour meeting.

446
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,360
Not when we start with them,

447
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,160
but in these times the difference is

448
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,080
across some of the CEOs,

449
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,840
both in our portfolio.

450
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,760
Plus, I've been investing

451
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,440
for a long time,

452
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,400
so I have other investments

453
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,480
across different businesses.

454
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,360
It's stunning.

455
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,640
The difference is the people that,

456
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,000
after our first meeting,

457
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,120
have already come up with solutions.

458
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,280
We've created this concept.

459
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,560
It's really a cool concept called

460
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,640
a growth committee,

461
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,960
even though it may be a bit

462
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,280
of a misnomer, in which

463
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,800
we take two of our partners

464
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,720
and then another VC

465
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,920
who's in our deal and the CEO,

466
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,400
and we meet every week,

467
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,880
every 10 days to talk about

468
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,920
how can we help the company

469
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,000
in this time.

470
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,120
And some CEOs

471
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,720
have changed their businesses,

472
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,960
have changed their direction,

473
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,400
have leaned into it.

474
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:17,880
And then they say,

475
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,600
"Now help us."

476
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,560
Some of them,

477
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,160
and it's not just

478
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,360
our companies, of course, say

479
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,080
"Can you help us?

480
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,680
What should we do?

481
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,320
How can we do?

482
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,240
When do we do it?"

483
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,000
OK, we're gonna of course

484
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,520
gonna help,

485
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,200
but the difference

486
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,520
in that conversation is huge.

487
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,720
And so we're seeing a lot of difference

488
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,720
both in the CEOs and how they react

489
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,200
to this crisis.

490
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,200
Incredible. Incredible.

491
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,640
Okay I'm gonna be a little bit selfish now

492
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,120
and I'm gonna ask for some personal advice

493
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,560
because it's pretty rare that

494
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,560
I have the opportunity to chat

495
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,640
for 20 minutes

496
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,480
with somebody like you.

497
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,160
So, I'm starting my journey

498
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,240
like a lot of my friends,

499
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,120
both in 8200 and at Stanford.

500
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,080
We're starting our journeys.

501
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,040
We're trying to become experts

502
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,000
in these different fields,

503
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,320
whether they're in cybersecurity

504
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,760
or AI or diplomacy or whatever.

505
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,400
And now we're gonna go out

506
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,080
to the real world

507
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,320
and we're gonna have to figure out ways

508
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,840
to make a true impact.

509
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,720
And my life goal,

510
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,360
as I'm starting to narrow it down,

511
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,520
is to really move the needle.

512
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,480
To create stuff that has

513
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,080
a positive social impact.

514
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,880
Connect the Jewish world

515
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,520
and Israelis properly.

516
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,440
I know that's something that you're

517
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,000
also very passionate about.

518
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,040
And, you know,

519
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,560
over your years of experiences

520
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,120
and seeing thousands upon thousands

521
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,120
of companies successes and failures.

522
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,520
What are some pro tips that

523
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,800
I can take with me more personally

524
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,920
so that I can keep on this

525
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,920
grit and resilience?

526
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,880
Well, the first thing I would do is

527
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,720
I'd join J-Angels

528
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,320
because the very mission

529
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,200
of what they're doing is in line

530
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,040
with what you're saying.

531
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,360
So, that'd be number one.

532
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,640
Number two, this is tangential to what

533
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,160
you ask, but it'll come back.

534
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,040
And it's something that if I ever stop

535
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,760
doing Zoom calls and e-mails,

536
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,480
I'm going to do.

537
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,560
And I'm gonna write a book on mentorship.

538
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,600
To me, there is nothing more

539
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,000
important than mentorship.

540
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,480
You know it says in

541
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,760
[Hebrew]

542
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,040
Get yourself a rabbi.

543
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,520
It doesn't mean a rabbi.

544
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,040
It really means get yourself a mentor

545
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,840
and not one, but three if you can.

546
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,160
And from the walks of life

547
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,760
that you think

548
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,920
you want to participate in.

549
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,640
Now you can't just put up

550
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,960
a dollar bill and get a mentor.

551
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,800
It doesn't work that way, as you know.

552
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,280
And read my book in 10 years

553
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,120
now and you'll get the hints.

554
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,200
But it's a very very important component

555
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,320
of what I would suggest

556
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,120
to any person starting

557
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,480
because you have a lot to learn.

558
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,400
You know a lot,

559
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,240
but you have a lot to learn.

560
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,920
So, I'd say that's number one.

561
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,400
And number two, define your goals.

562
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,760
Not I'm gonna go into cyber,

563
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,080
I'm gonna go into AI.

564
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,760
That's good.

565
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,240
But I would call define your goals.

566
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,440
I'm going into technology,

567
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,120
into deep technology. Okay.

568
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,920
So, now I have a bucket and I know that

569
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,360
I want it to be in Israel and

570
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,440
I want to help humanity.

571
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,840
OK, well maybe it's something

572
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,200
in the digital health space

573
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,000
as an example.

574
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,680
Or there are so many

575
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,760
great companies springing up.

576
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,040
How do you solve the problem

577
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,120
loneliness in the elderly?

578
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,720
Define a problem that is fits

579
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,880
the criteria or your criteria

580
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,160
that fit the problem.

581
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,160
And then who are

582
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,240
the best people in that space?

583
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,520
Who are the best companies?

584
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,720
Who are  the best mentors?

585
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,270
Who are the best venture capitalists?

586
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,840
And I met a guy who was

587
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,440
a very very senior guy.

588
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,920
Chairman and CEO of a huge company.

589
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,000
And the year before,

590
00:17:13,010 -> 00:17:15,720
public company, top five, three.

591
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,440
And the year before, or 18 months before,

592
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,880
he knew he was retiring.

593
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,320
He spent that time figuring out

594
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,790
what public boards he wanted to go on,

595
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,830
but not which companies. Which sectors.

596
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,960
He figured that out.

597
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,480
And then he said,

598
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,000
"What are the three

599
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,560
best companies in each sector?"

600
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,270
So, he had 15 companies.

601
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,040
And then he went out

602
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,560
to figure out.

603
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,400
And when he left,

604
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,720
he got the boards he wanted.

605
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,800
So, that's a little bit

606
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,640
later in your career.

607
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,320
But be strategic about it

608
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,400
without overthinking it

609
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,790
'cause young people over think.

610
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,480
Be strategic and then go after

611
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,110
and you can do it.

612
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,200
You have LinkedIn, you have J-Angels

613
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,270
You have your 8200.

614
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,720
When I graduated from college,

615
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,830
my dad was a rabbi.

616
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,030
You know how many connections I had?

617
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,960
You're looking at it right here.

618
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,750
I talk to my kids or to you.

619
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,270
You have a hundred connections

620
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,160
that I never could have dreamed of.

621
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,480
How do they fit into your goals?

622
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,320
It's incredible because so many people

623
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,110
around my community,

624
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,880
and I'm having these conversations now

625
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,880
with former soldiers that I've commanded

626
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,480
and with fellow friends at Stanford

627
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,920
who are a little bit younger than me.

628
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,000
And and they're looking

629
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,590
for advice on where to go.

630
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,760
And there's this constant conflict between

631
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,160
you know this company that pays me

632
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,040
maybe a little bit more per month

633
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,880
or the company that I'm truly excited about

634
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
that is perhaps going to

635
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,160
even teach me more.

636
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,400
And it almost seems like

637
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,360
there's a growing social pressure

638
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,200
to make the most amount of money

639
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,320
and your internship,

640
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,480
or to be in the fund that has

641
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,790
the biggest name or something.

642
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,080
But I -

643
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,310
... very sad

644
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,000
That makes me very sad

645
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,830
Because, you know they say

646
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,720
a guy in my generation will have 10 jobs.

647
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,840
A guy in your generation,

648
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,880
a guy or gal, will have 10 careers.

649
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:49,880
Think about that.

650
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,440
So, that's absurd.

651
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,160
I mean, if you're poor

652
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,120
and you need to put food on the table,

653
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,750
it makes a difference.

654
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,110
Obviously, I'm not talking about that.

655
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,560
But if it's 100 grand versus 80

656
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,510
or 70 or 60 and one you're gonna love.

657
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,590
I wouldn't even have that conversation. It's so simple to me

658
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Right. I mean, definitely.

659
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,000
I think that one of the trends

660
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,120
that I've been seeing talking to

661
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,640
really incredible people through this show

662
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,760
is that the really number one common ground

663
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,680
that everybody has is the passion.

664
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,600
And I'm talking to people

665
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,550
who have a spark in their eyes.

666
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,720
I'm seeing the spark in your eye

667
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,800
and the way that you're talking about

668
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,110
the things that you do in life.

669
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,520
And that's the solution for me

670
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,760
to do things that I feel passionate about,

671
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,790
that I have this intrinsic motivation

672
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,760
and making sure, of course,

673
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,680
that there's food on the table.

674
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,830
But at the end

675
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,280
both myself and a lot of my friends

676
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,110
are lucky to have that.

677
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,760
And we have the privilege of

678
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,840
going and exploring the things

679
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,270
that we're truly passionate about.

680
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,040
Isaac, I wanna thank you

681
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,720
so much for the time.

682
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,960
I have one last question

683
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,350
that I have to ask you.

684
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,480
Three words that you would use

685
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,520
to describe yourself

686
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,080
or that your wife would use

687
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,720
to describe you.

688
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,000
No, the ones that my wife

689
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,070
would not work.

690
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,310
I don't do enough work around the house.

691
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,120
Let's not use that.

692
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,000
I would say I'm a connector.

693
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,560
I love the people

694
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,280
part of anything that I do.

695
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,680
Goal oriented is not fair,

696
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,270
but I'm very focused.

697
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,560
I get a ... in my head

698
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,040
and I wanna go find a winery

699
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,960
and make that a kosher run.

700
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,920
I'm gonna do that.

701
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:08,840
And I'll tell you,

702
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,070
not the most important thing,

703
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,480
but don't forget about it.

704
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,750
And that's have some fun.

705
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,600
You talk about people in your generation

706
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,310
who maybe take a better job.

707
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,000
I find people who just take themselves

708
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,550
too seriously sometimes.

709
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,920
It's important.

710
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,400
Get a cigar, box of cigars,

711
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,920
get some whiskey, get some wine,

712
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,800
get some friends and enjoy yourself

713
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,240
while you're at the game

714
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,960
'cause you know you're only here once.

715
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,880
I love it.

716
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,600
I think you're your LinkedIn picture

717
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,320
with the cigar is one of my favorite pictures

718
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,240
I've ever seen of anybody.

719
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,960
So it's wonderful.

720
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,480
I'm gonna take that advice to heart.

721
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,360
Isaac, thank you so much

722
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,110
for the inspiration, for the time.

723
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,480
And I look forward to seeing you

724
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,070
in one of the Shabbats.

725
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,310
Sooner than you think.

726
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,200
Wonderful.

727
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,640
Take care.

728
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,790
... great interview.

729
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,550
Thank you.

730
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,200
Bye bye.
