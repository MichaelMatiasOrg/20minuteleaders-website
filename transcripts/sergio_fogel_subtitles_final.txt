Wonderful. Okay. Sergio Fogel, thank you so much for being on my show. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good morning for me. Good morning. Yeah. So, how are you? I mean, you're in Uruguay now. How is everything with covid? Oh, this is like an island. We have very very few cases. Not a single person right now in hospital. Wow. Okay. ... amazing. Okay. So, what I love about this is that this is actually going to be showed in a few weeks. So, this is always a fun test to see how things are now, and then in a few weeks when this gets published to our page, we're gonna see what actually happens. But let's be optimistic and see that everything is fine. I'm going to bet that when this show is aired we have zero cases. Incredible. Funnily enough, or actually not funny retty sad, I had a show with an entrepreneur from Israel about a month and a half ago when there were zero cases. And he said, "Yeah, everything is fantastic. It's great." And then I said, "Well, let's wait and see what happens." And the show is gonna air this week. And the first sentence is that, and I say it on the show, "Well, let's be optimistic" But obviously we know what's happening in Israel now. So, we're gonna give it another try. Sergio, I want to spend as much time as we can talking about emerging markets. You're an expert in digital, in FinTech. And you're one of the most renowned innovators and entrepreneurs of Uruguay and Latin America. A limited partner at J-Ventures where we work together. So much is going on. You're dealing with one of the most incredible industries and one of the most fascinating industries because you're actually dealing with revolutionizing people's lives and the way they interact with businesses and consumers. I traveled to Mexico last year with one of my best friends from Stanford. I noticed how the credit card revolution and digital banking revolution is just starting out. It was incredible. Please tell me a little bit more about you and what is dLocal? Okay. So, where do I start? Let me first tell you a bit about myself. I was born here in Uruguay. I did aliyah I wanted to live in Israel when I was 20 years old. Studied at the Technion. Worked for IBM. Then, I went to do my MBA at INSEAD in France. Very international school. Yeah. And then for family reasons, we wanted our kids to grow near their grandparents. So, with my wife, we decided it was very very tough decision. We decided to move back to Uruguay. But we felt all the time very very attached to Israel where we lived for almost 10 years. And because of INSEAD, we were always very very international. We just love to travel and visit the world and meet different people and cultures and so. Yeah. So after a stint working for large companies, we set up our first venture together my wife and myself. I'm going to give you one big piece of advice: never do a company with your wife or loved one because you put too much at risk. It was a very very bad idea. I've heard that quite a few times. Don't mix the two things. Also with best friends. Don't start a company with your best friend. That's a good idea. So, first company was a failure. Then my second one, it was a telecom company, voice over IP Company which we started back in the year 2000. It's still running very very small because who uses voice over IP. We did long distance international phone calls. So, I guess no one does international phone calls anymore. And then 12 years ago we started AstroPay, which from that company we spun off dLocal. But before, so before you tell me what these are, I want you to tell me a little bit about the market. Latin America, hundreds of millions of people. Coming from Israel and from North America, it's a different market. It's a different lifestyle, different mentality. What is happening in terms of FinTech and the way consumers are interacting with small businesses up until AstroPay and dlocal come into the market? Okay. So first of all, you need to take into account that there is not a country called Latin America. It's very very different. You go to Brazil that you have one culture. You go to Colombia, it's a completely different culture. You go to Argentina it's completely culture and regulations. Right. And when we talk about FinTech, regulators play a very very big part. Of course. So, you go to Brazil and you'll find that almost everybody has a credit card or a debit card, but you go to some other countries and you see that credit card penetration is quite low. Right. Now, something that is quite common to all these markets, not only these markets, we also work in countries like India or Indonesia or Africa. Something that happened is that you see many many countries where credit card penetration is very low, and they are completely leapfrogging the credit card and going straight to wallets. Straight to digital wallets. Yes. Yes. So,the biggest case, greatest example, is actually China. You go to China. I was there late last year and nobody is carrying a wallet anymore. So people, it's the mobile phone. And you go to a restaurant, you pay scanning a QR code. You go to a store, again, it's WeChat Pay everywhere. Yeah. Maybe AliPay but it's all e-wallets. Incredible. Yeah. Now, the pain that we come to solve is that all these people with this, actually all of those countries they have some preferred payment method 'cause everybody is paying. And in many cases, people are going out of, I will go away from cash. Yeah. In some places, people pay scanning a QR code. In some places they give a debit card, a credit card. In many many cases it's a credit card, but it's not Visa or MasterCard branded. So you go to Argentina, you have many people with a card called Tarjeta Naranja. You go to Mexico and people pay with cash. They like to go ... and pay cash. You go to India, you have all these e-wallets. It's all good for the consumers because the local businesses accept those payment methods, but when an international merchant goes, we call merchant actually anyone who accepts payments. Right. A company that wants to sell it to these markets and we are talking about very very big markets. You go and you sell it to those markets and you find that people either do not want to pay with a credit card if they have it, or they cannot pay. So, let's give you know the classic example. You have a Ridesharing service who wants to penetrate into a market, let's say, into a country in Latin America that there is a very low penetration of credit cards or something of that sort. And all of a sudden they're stuck because they are used to getting payments through your credit card. And if the country doesn't have credit card, then it doesn't matter that you have the drivers and the cars because you can't accept the payments. And then here you are coming in and you're saying, "Okay, let's think of a creative way to bridge this gap between the local and the international." Exactly. You nailed it right in the middle. So, that was a great example. When Uber came, it was the first Ridesharing company to come to the region. They came and they saw that most people couldn't pay. So, many people went to the bank and they got their first credit card. Many of them got debit cards. But then what you find is that debit cards in most of these places are not enabled for e-commerce. So, then we came in and what we did was we enabled Uber both to accept payments from the riders - And also pay the drivers, right? Also pay the drivers. Yes. And also accept payments from the drivers. Because what happened was that at one point they said, "Okay, let's allow the drivers to accept cash payments." Okay. So, I think the very first place where they tried it was, I may be wrong, but I think it was Peru. In Peru, you could pay the driver in cash. But then at the end of the week, the payments was reversed. Instead of paying the driver, you needed to collect the commission from the driver. Incredible how similar services have to make these adaptations for the local culture norms that they have. Because here in, imagining in California going into an Uber and trying to pay them in cash, it's unheard of. What happened was that the moment they started accepting cash, the sales or actually the ... went through the roof. Of course. And sometimes, in many many cases, it's a very big differentiator. You want to accept more payment methods so it's a competitive advantage against your competitors. But how does dLocal actually make that adjustment? How do you mitigate between the two sides? So, let's say you go to Peru or Uruguay or some other country, and Uber wants to come in. Low credit card penetration, how do you deal with that? Okay, first of all, we are integrated today with over 300 different payment methods. Wow. I didn't know there are so many. Sorry? I didn't know there are so many payment methods. There are more. There are even more. So each one of our customers, customer call the merchants which is the companies. They decide which type of payment methods they want to accept. Of course, there are different fees for different payment methods. So, you have different networks and local credit and debit cards and bank transfers and wallets. There are literally thousands. So when they go into a market, we work together. We have a team of what we call technical account managers that are engineers that work together with the customer and we decide what is the best integration to use. What is the best payment method for each particular customer. For instance, if you are at Netflix, it's a subscription model. So, you want a payment method that you can pull money from the accounts. You don't want the person to have to go and pay with cash. Or maybe you do want, but if you want the customer to pay in cash, maybe you want to charge them every three months instead of every month. Right. You need to fine tune that and it's very important that we actually know each one of those markets. We have people on the ground in each one of the countries that we serve. You're saying you have people on the ground in each of these countries. So, how many people are involved with dLocal right now? We are around 280 people now. Wow. We're growing very fast. We'll be over 500 by next year. By next year? Yes. That's incredible. Okay. So, now the given question is what is it like to run such a fast growing company at emerging markets? I mean, during covid most people are firing. You're doubling your size within a year. Yeah. Since covid started we've hired, I don't remember the exact number, probably around 30 people. It's very challenging to bring people in when you cannot be face to face with them - Of course. The culture, it is hard. For me it's very easy because I'm no longer CEO of the company. We have a CEO who is much younger. He lives in Israel, by the way. But it is very very challenging. We have lots of very young people. Our CEO is I believe 29 years old I'm not sure if he's 30 yet. But isn't it challenging that the leadership team has to, when you're thinking of a new market to enter or the new adaptations you have to make to different emerging markets. You have to really understand their culture. You have to be sort of, you need to be local, right? dLocal, you need to be local to that market. So, how do you mitigate this the fact that the leadership team perhaps is from Israel or is like from different places in the world, and all of a sudden they have to make strategic decisions based on an emerging market that they don't necessarily empathize with? We travel a lot. We have local people. Probably the most challenging market for us was China actually. And what we did in China is we recruited a team over there. Of course, we started with one key person. But we recruited a team of around 15 people. And we sent a few people that were working with us for a long time which are living in China. So, we try to mix the company culture with the local culture so they both work together. It's not easy. This is quite challenging, but again, we need to have, we do have local people in each one of the markets because that's the only way that we can really understand the markets. Amazing. Okay. And we ... a lot. We get together once a year with all the team and we work very hard on the culture and interaction between the people. Okay. Sergio, talked to me a little bit about entrepreneurship and innovation in Latin America. What is the scene like? Where is it headed? And what are some of the most exciting opportunities that I could be excited about as a young entrepreneur? Let's say, if I want to enter this market and to make an impact, a good impact on the market as a whole. First of all I'm a very firm believer that entrepreneurship is it's everywhere. Actually the more challenging the environment, the more entrepreneurship you have. You go to, I don't know, you go to a place like India, for example, and everybody needs to be entrepreneur because otherwise even, I don't know, doing some basic tasks that in the US are so simple, requires you to be creative and find your ways around. Definitely. So, I think that entrepreneurship and innovation happens everywhere. It's no longer something that comes out of the Silicon Valley. And I think that post covid, after companies got used to hiring remote, the moment that you're hiring remote, the border doesn't mean anything anymore. Nothing. If you're going to hire remote, the person can be sitting in Sunnyvale, or in New York, or in Argentina. It doesn't make any - So you expect this to accelerate the productivity of the markets that until now they didn't have access to a lot of these companies because of geography. Now, the engineers over there and the people who are able to work in tech, they can work and they often work at cheaper prices, right? I mean, doesn't have to be cheaper prices, but as a company it opens the whole world and there is talent everywhere. Everywhere, right. And for every, I don't know, for every Uruguayan that is working in the valley, there are 10 other Uruguayans that are as talented, and that they don't want to leave. They want to live - No no, of course. When I mentioned the cheaper prices, I meant only in the sense of, here the my friends are paying $2500 a month rent plus $20 a meal three times a day to just to eat. You go around the world to any place, it's not the same prices. So in order to have a similar lifestyle, you don't need to get an entrance salary of 130, 140K as an engineer. Of course. Yeah. Right. So, back to your question. There are many many exciting things happening in Latin America. FinTech is one of them. Banks here are very very old fashioned. Very inefficient. So in all the different areas of Fintech, there are many things going on in payments, in lending, in insurance, you name it. There are things happening. Again, as I said before, in Fintech in particular, regulators are very key player in that ecosystem. So, and they are starting to see that at the end of the day, they need to provide consumers with more options. Being careful, of course, because you want to make sure that there is no money laundering or anything bad going on. So, that's one area. Everything cross-border is super exciting. I am an investor in a cross-border e-commerce company. And again, with covid, sales are going through their roof. It's amazing what's going on in that market. There are many companies that are doing software development and testing for ... Sorry about that. No problem. What else, Proptech there's a lot going on. Essentially you have many many companies that are clones of US or European company - I seen that as a trend that a lot of US, a lot of these emerging markets, they're looking at the successful innovations of the US and they're making a local adaptation of them into their country. But Sergio, before we leave, I wanna thank you again for your time. 20 minutes always go by so quickly and I always learn so much from these incredible conversations. But I have to ask the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. I would say I'm very curious. International. And entrepreneur. I love it. Curious, international, entrepreneur. Sergio, thank you very much for the inspiration. Thank you for everything that you've taught me. And good luck with covid and I hope that it will continue to be zero cases also when this is published. I really hope so. Really really hope so. Take care. Thank you very much. Bye. Bye.
