Doron Reuveni, thank you so much for joining me on the show. My pleasure. Really great to have you. You're the CEO of Applause now. A fantastic company that I actually, I've been following quite closely ever since my time in the IDF and building software myself. But I'd love to get started by getting to know you a little bit better. How you've come to Applause to be the CEO, you actually were also the board member of RunKeeper, right? Yeah, I was. until it was actually sold to ASICS at the time. So, I do like to take a few independent board seats and help young entrepreneurs and CEOs, and grow their company. And I did it a few times. I was RunKeeper, I think three years ago. And one was GrabCAD, that was another company that I was a board on. Well, I love RunKeeper. I actually use it most on a daily basis to run. So, as soon as I saw it, I got so excited. Doron, tell me, what is it like to be a board member of a sort of B2C company where there's so much engagement with the users and the growth is tremendous. What is your role as a board member for a company like RunKeeper? Yeah. So RunKeeper is actually a very good example because first of all, for me it was very interesting because they had a great founder. I always loved working with the great founder. I just give you an example. You know, he was the first one that came with the mobile app, that tracks your running and create the running community. And at the beginning, he had no funding. So, he was actually running the Boston Marathon with this, like, iPhone outfit. So, he was so passionate about it. He was running with an iPhone app. And you can probably look it up. It's actually pretty interesting. I'm gonna put it right over here with my tremendous editing. So, right over here, there's gonna be a picture of him running with the iPhone outfit. Yeah, I can probably send it to him. We're still good friends. And for me, it was a very interesting endeavor because my background is in B2B and enterprise software. And RunKeeper is obviously a B2C company. And actually one of the first one that focused on mobile application in iPhone. And it was for me a very good endeavor into the metrics and analytics of a big company. And one of the reasons that I joined this, obviously gain some more experience from the B2C space, but also kind of help RunKeeper, because what happened to them is they was the first one that actually came out, but they were not, they were getting their lunch eaten a little bit by companies like Strava that came from the cycling world. And there was a few other examples, few companies that were acquired by Under Armour Express, etc. So, I mean, the investment had to figure out a way together with the CEO, to put the company on a trajectory to continue to grow and success. And eventually we did that. And that was actually sold to ASICS, which is a running shoe company. I guess that was a great success for them to bring there in the team. And now they're basically part of the digital, I would say digital agency of ASICS. So, everything digital for ASICS is actually going through the RunKeeper. Wow. My job as an independent board member and I think this is very important for CEOs and young entrepreneurs to understand, is that your investors and you as a CEO don't always have an alignment in regards to your goal. And investors need to take care of their investment. The CEO needs to take care of the companies, the employees, the management teams. And sometimes that creates a challenge. Right. Many times are aligned in order to grow the company because the company is doing well. Everybody is successful. But many times there is a certain amount of friction. And I think the role of an independent board member is to actually play that role where his incentive is not the investor. His incentives is not the [--]. His incentive is not necessarily the CEO. There's one thing that he sees that he really cares about, and that's the company. And being a good independent board member is like super critical to the success of the company. Because you actually bring together employees, CEOs, management team, and actually the investors and actually bring them together on the same path. Sometimes it's not an easy job. But you've gotta make sure that you always think about what's best for the company. And that's what the good independent board members does. Do you feel like part of the company? Do you feel like you have a stake in the company emotionally? Or do you feel more of an adviser that is overlooking this operation? And obviously you have the best interests in mind for both the CEO and the company. But how connected are you to the mission and the values that the company exudes? So I'm very connected. And that basically means that I would never take an independent voting without investing in the company myself. Oh, Okay. But that's me personally. Not every independent board member does that. So, why is that? Why do you do that? I do that in order to prove that it's important to me to think about the company first. Okay. So, that's me. By the way, I learned things from an independent board member that I had when I was in Applause. His name was [--]. He actually sold a company to IBM for about three billion dollars. But he was my independent board member. And he invested in my company. And I learned from him that if you wanna truly become a equity independent board member and help the CEOs and the VC and grow a company, you've gotta have an incentive to make the company successful. And if you put your money where your mouth is, that is always very helpful Because you never forget. And I always invest in those companies. And I would say I was, I probably were part of five companies where I was an independent board member. And I think I've four very good successes and one failure, which is not bad. It's pretty fantastic. I'd say it's pretty fantastic statistics. Wonderful. Doron, talk to me about Applause. Writing software is difficult. Software is eating the world's, a quote by Marc Andreessen himself. What is applause? And why is it so relevant as the years go by? Because it's been here for some time. Yes. So, Applause has been around for about 11 years. I would say when the company just started and I'm also the co-founder of the company, the idea was really simple at the time. The idea was we invest a lot of money in testing software. People, process, methodology, tools. But when software gets through the hands of real people, there's still multiple issues that gets out. And we always need to remember that the reason why we develop software is in order to serve humans. Right. Right. That's really why we developed software, why everybody developed software. And the idea was really simple. Why aren't we successful? The point was we're actually missing a step. And the step was actually testing in the wild. Actually simulating and mimicking your real users, your real customers. And that's the way to find issues that they never found in a lab environment, bound by automation. And the idea was saying, why don't we build a global community of test engineers and test in the wild on real devices, real configuration. Its scale, its speed, in real time, 24/7, 365. And that's actually what we came about. Indeed we actually build a technology platform. Platform 1 and 5 integrate with the product development life cycle. Bob Tracking System and CI/CD and on the other inside manages a global view of software tech engine. Which is today more than half a million community members from 200 countries and regions worldwide. And you can think it's a simple idea. I mean,  I take a software for dog, and an iPhone app, an IOT app, whatever it is, and throw it over the world to bunch of people. But it's not really like that because let's talk about the complexity. If you take Uber as an example, they actually match a driver and a passenger for a single point in time for a single ride, single transaction. We actually match a dedicated team with a software product on an ongoing basis. And the team needs to fix the experience of the software product. And there's communication and collaboration, and it's done in real time 24/7. So, the technology and obviously, incentives for the testers in order to align incentives, which is what the company is looking for. So, the complexity is actually really high. From a technology platform perspective. And I would also say most of our customers are big enterprise companies. So, when you look at your iPhone or Android device, I was happy to say that probably 50 or 60% of the apps that you have out there are probably tested by Applause. And that includes companies like Google and Microsoft and Amazon. But also the retailers and media companies, and many tons of enterprise companies that really focus on making their customers and users success. Right. Doron, this concept of testing in the wild, I think that's so interesting. Because almost every software team in the world today has this notion of quality testing. Both software testing. Test driven methodology or QA team that runs and does a 100 manual test cases. I know it in the in the Army, in 8200 where I served, we spent days testing every software to make sure we don't have any errors. What is the difference between testing in the wild and the notion of doing tests in-house within your company? Why is that different? Yes. So, I think two things that basically happen if you test in-house, you actually are testing in a single location and you have a limited amount of devices that to test it on. It's also very tiring to test. Right. It's very repetitive cycle costs. And you're not actually doing, journeys and use cases, or exploratory like a real user would do. And that's exactly what we do. I think the most simple example, take HBO Go. Can you test HBO Go from China? From Vietnam? No, they don't even have distribution rates or the concept of it. And these are average regular people sitting at home who can sign up and have incentives to go and just download the app and play with it. And they can perhaps go through a list of tasks or they can just do a free for all. And for every bug that they find, they get some incentive for it, right? That's correct. But it's not only like that. It's actually a dedicated team. And we actually do automatic matching. So if I'm any type of company, let's say Wal-Mart testing my one month application. You want to make sure that you test it in areas where there is a Walmart. You wanna make sure that you do customer journey. Do order from your mobile phone and pick it up at the store. You want to make sure that the whole experience actually works well. And that's what's really being tested. And you wanna make sure that you tested on devices that are in North America. In central locations where they rolled out pick up in store. You actually wanna really simulate and mimic the users. But you also want to have good testers, that have experience and expertise. And have them dedicated to the work on an ongoing basis and have incentives to actually look for the things that you care about. Because many times when you hire a team in India, they just run through test cases. Right. This is a little bit more than that because incentives to actually find fault that the customer is looking for so he can fix it and basically launched better products into the market. But this isn't instead of the QA on the team or internal testing, right? This is as a supplement to really go the extra mile and say, "Yes, we have caught 80 or 85% of the bugs on our end in our testing cycles." But there will inevitably be 10 to 15% out in the wild because of weird devices, and screen resolutions, and Wi-Fi and country VPNs, right? Well, the honest truth is that they actually started like that. It started that augmentation to quarantine. But as we evolve and mature with the company, today we manage a complete cycles for a lot of our customers on an ongoing basis. All right. So, I would say that both models are available. If you wanna have your own team and kind of augmented it, that's fine. If you wanna have a take ownership of everything including automation, So, today, over time, we'll build technology that allows you to do automation, that allows you to do accessibility to have people to supercritical for every mobile and web application today. If you wanna make sure that you do voice testing. You wanna make sure that you do data collection for AI and e-mail engine, a very high quality, and then test the engine. So, we actually today do all that. And I think one very important thing to note is that many teams look at automation and manual testing as separate. We actually look at the very holistic way, look at it in a very holistic way. So, automation and manual testing and in the wild and test case execution and exploratory testing need to work in harmony. So, our platform today is a true digital quality platform that allows you to actually bring all of these together into a single metric and helps you make better decisions. When are you really ready to talk. Okay. Wonderful. Doron, tell me what is it like being the CEO of a company that's 11 years old, a SAS company. I mean, how do you dedicate a vision to a company and that's 11 years old. Where is it at now? And how has your role as the CEO transitioned over the years now that it's profitable and you're just enjoying it? Yeah. So, when the companies started, I remember we started from an idea. Like we went and raised money from a PowerPoint that's basically from a concept. Company today is completely different. Right. Way over $100 million in revenue. It's a profitable company. We have 500 employees. Offices in multiple locations worldwide. So, first of all, it's great to see. But I think it's very important to know that vision is something that evolves over time. Right. You always need to have a North Star that's you basically go and aspire to be. So I think if the beginning it was, in the wild testing we wanna be this augmentation staff and then we wanna make sure that we wanna be a team. And we wanna make sure that that all the testing is done. And now the vision is that true digital quality platform. The vision is evolving over time. Right. As the company matures. And I think one of the most important positions and jobs that the CEO and founder needs to do is make sure that everybody is aligned on a vision. And that basically means the management eventually is invested. They're all aligned on a vision. And from my personal perspective, as long as  it's exciting and I keep learning and the company still scaling and growing, and then I'm enjoying myself. Right? And I would say that today Applause is not the same than it was a year ago. And it's definitely not the same 10 years ago. And as long as that keeps on growing as a company and doing that and train being the real leader in the market, then I enjoy what I do. I love it. Is there still room for risk taking or or it's the more of an approach of don't fix what ain't broken? Oh, you gotta take risks. You gotta take risks. First of all, I think at a certain point in time, some companies actually do the mistake of still being innovative. Right? Right. And I think once you do that, they said, the potential of a spiral roll down is very very high. Yeah. Because once you're successful, once you're successful you'll have competitors and some of them are smart people that you pave the path to them and if you mess it up, they're gonna take your spot. Right? So, you've gotta continue to innovate. And we put every year, we have what's called the Applause labs. And that's part of our engineering team. And all they do is think about new ideas and new concepts. And we're rolling out new functionality, new features and new capabilities, and new product. Today you can bring your own team as part of the Applause platform. So, let's say you have a team of business users that you wanna test. And you have the data in one location into that. There's many new functionality like no code automation that will launch into the market which is a brand new concept around automation of software. So, the company is investing quite a lot in what would be innovative. It's very important to also make sure that the innovation is around your vision. Right? You need to continue to strive for your vision. Otherwise the forces are not aligned. And it sounds like a huge responsibility that you're taking being a global leader and what it means to have quality testing and quality assurance over products. And it's almost an innate responsibility that you're taking on as you're continuously thinking what is the next step for quality. How is the world transitioning to testing, especially as software is developing. New languages are coming up. New technologies are arising constantly. You know, over the past five years, IOT has completely exploded. Now there is gonna be AI models on device all around us. And this is gonna bring new challenges, I'm sure to testing new edge cases that nobody have thought of. And you own this responsibility of making the leap forward. Right? And by the way, those challenges today exist already, right? I mean, let me give you another, and better we do all that type of testing. Let me give you another analogy. So, you look at Voice, for example. And you look at the evolution of Voice. The voice is actually growing much more than what mobile grew because of two reasons: One, it's a natural way for a human to interact with software. And two, it's completely device independent. It doesn't matter if you interact with your phone, or with Android or with IOS. And so with your video or with your fridge, it's a natural way to interact. And that's actually growing exponentially faster than what mobile apps use to grow. And that basically means that companies are investing in voice applications. Right. And we do a bunch of testing around voice applications. And we work with some of the infrastructure players like Amazon and Google around testing their infrastructure for voice. Because Alexa is becoming more sophisticated. Right? And there's many other companies that are investing in voice infrastructure, and AI and email infrastructure. So actually, it's very exciting to be part of that and help those companies create a better digital experience and a better world for all. Very very cool. Doron, right before we leave, 20 minutes they always end so quick. But I somehow I feel like I'm learning so much. So, thank you for your time. I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. And again, thank you for doing this. You have 500 people that you're managing across so many different places. And it's just inspiring to see how you helped grow this company from a PowerPoint idea. Seven years later to this global leader on quality and testing. And as an engineer myself, obviously, I know how critical this is and how difficult it is to really feel confident in software that you wrote. So really really incredible to hear what you guys are doing. Yes. So, I'll give you a few words. So, Persistent. Right. So, be persistent. Believe. Okay. As an entrepreneur, you go to very hard times and you've gotta believe in your vision and basically what you're doing. And lastly, it's Love doing. Right. You're doing it not because of money not  because of anything. You're doing it because you love doing. So, I think these are the three, I would say, concept that I really love. I love it. And on the side, you're still investing right, in early stage companies, also through J-Ventures, but also through, Are you still sitting on board seats right now? I'm actually sitting on a board seat of a company which I actually can't announce because they haven't launched yet. But it's one of my passion. So, I actually enjoyed biking and it's the company that is involved in the biking industry. So, it's gonna announce later this summer. And I wanted to announce but I'll wait out. But that's that's the only company I'm on the board of. Other than Applause, of course. Of course. Doron, toda raba. Thank you very, very much. And best of luck with everything. Thank you for your time. Thank you. My pleasure. Take care. Take care.
