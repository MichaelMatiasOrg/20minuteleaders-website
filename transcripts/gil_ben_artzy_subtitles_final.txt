1 All right. Gil Ben Artzy, thank you for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Absolutely. Thank you so much for having me. You already told me you're gonna cheat on the last question. So, I'm so excited for this interview because it's gonna be I think different from all the rest. Gil, we know each other for many many years now. Ever since I think I came to visit you in Palo Alto like six years ago for Anymeal, the diet startup. Gil, give me two, three sentences about Upwest and what you guys do. I had an episode with Shuly but it's so amazing that we have to talk about it again. There you go. So, you can compare notes and see if we're doing a good job. I want to see if you're consistant There you go. So, Upwest is an early stage seed fund. We actually invest in both pre-seed and seed stage. And we are tailor-made for Israeli founders that are looking to break into the US market. So, we are focused on investing in Israeli founders and helping them in the early stages of ramping up the team, getting momentum, fund raising and so forth, here in the US. We've done it for close to nine years now. We've backed over 80 companies that raised over, well over, one billion dollars in follow and financing. First investor in ... which is a Unitcon startup and many other prominent companies that we think at least a few will reach that stage. So, we've been super excited to do this for a while now. And yeah, I'm looking for the future ahead. Amazing. So, I always joked with new funds that when you start out, the lifetime of a company is like, what, seven to nine years That's the game you're going in to. So, usually the first few years it can kind of go along without showing too many returns because it takes seven to nine years. But you're there. So, now you have to show returns and obviously you've showing some pretty amazing returns or you've shown amazing companies and where they're at now. What is this idea of Israelis in Silicon Valley and this integration and adaptation? So, first of all, eight, nine years in VC is very very young. I'm still learning every day. It's the equivalent of maybe eight, nine months in the startups. So, we've been around for a while but it takes time, decades. You know, I think Israel always had a very special relationship with the US. But on the tech funds, specifically with the valley, you've seen over the years fantastic companies emerge here. And in the last couple of decades in particular, many fantastic companies, such as House and others have emerged here by really incredible Israeli founders. And our goal is to level the playing fields for Israeli companies that wanna come here and get the same opportunities that other founders that are already based here. Amazing. Gil, how many companies, how many decks do you read a year? We see well over a thousand. We invest in far less than one percent. And what, the way we think about it is not about screening them and stuff. I mean, we spend a lot of time in Israel and here and whether its Zoom or in person, our goal is really also to give feedback. Like we wanna contribute to their journey. Give them some insights about the market. Maybe a few competitors that maybe had not heard about or know, you know or we can add more information about. So, we really wanna help them and advise them because they deserve it. Incredible. I don’t know many people who can talk about their job and say that after nine years of being in the same quote unquote job they're still learning every day and it feels like they were only there for eight or nine months. So, already I'm inspired by this passion. Gil, where do you come from? You have a pretty interesting leeway. Yeah. So, Israeli you're talking right. My first nine years I, I was actually born in Be'er Sheva. When my parents were in their very early 20s and going to university. So, I was born in Be'er Sheva but I grow up my first nine years in Kfar Saba. We then moved to London. I spend seven years growing up in London. I can feel it in the accent. The accent and definitely my passion for specific music and sports emerged there. What is that passion? What is that music? Well, growing up in London in the 80s, right. You get attached to certain types of music and take it with you. But yeah. I'm definitely, like discovering new music on a numbering basis. I think that's where it began. Came back to Israel sixteen. Back to Kfar Saba. Did my military service. Wasn’t smart enough to be in 8200 and so forth. I'm the oldest of three siblings, so I'm the alpha version. The alpha version is ... So, my brother and sister did much better than me at school. But I spend three years in the armed corps, did my undergrad, and at the age of 25, I decided that I want to break into the US market on my own. Right? No real tech background but I did wanna know that I wanted to spend some time here. And moved here to do my MBA at Wharton. Worked for BCG in New York and then Yahoo and here we are. Amazing. And what did you do at Yahoo? I started off in the Corporate Development team which was amazing exposure. Got to work with fantastic people and even the founders of Yahoo. Being Israeli, I send myself to Israel once or twice a year. To see startups. Help them. But also ended up acquiring Yahoo's first company in Israel. Helping to open the first R&D center in Haifa. And it's actually where the seeding of sort of Upwest began when I met Shuly in 2006 and we start ... start differences between some of the founders here and some of the founders in Israel that were at least on the same level in terms of their DNA but maybe didn’t have the same opportunities of those that were already based in the US. Incredible. I mean I was just such a small kid. You're saying Yahoo. That was about 2005, 2006? Started in '05 spent 4 years in CopDev and 2 years in operations. Yes. At that time I had my Yahoo mailbox and all my friends had a Yahoo mailbox. It was obviously a different time back then in terms of the market share of the companies. But that's incredible. And Gil, you have the unique experience of being a partner in quite a few portfolio companies. How many portfolio companies do you see through now? Over the past nine years? How many have we invested or seen? Right yeah invested in. That you're a part of their journey. Invested in, 82. 82. Okay. So, you have the unique privilege and the challenging role to come in to this incredibly difficult time over the past three months and you have to help 82 companies or a little less go through this journey of dealing with Covid-19 and you actually have to do it also with a newborn. Congratulations. Thank you. Beautiful Maya. What is that like? What is your role as the VC partner and helping these portfolio companies push through this? So, first of all it's not individual support, right. I mean it's myself, my partners, but also the other well investors that back the companies. And I think for us it's giving a sanity check to the founders and also helping spread information what others are doing. So, for example in the very beginning, it's really encouraging them to take a close look at their runway and not be shy in making decisions, some of them tough, about their workforce because the longer you procrastinate and say, "You know, we'll have to wait." the more painful it become afterwards. So, it’s having those eyes wide open conversation. Did you have a situation where you pushed a founder to make that difficult decision and you feel like if you weren't in the picture they might not have been able to make it? Yeah, I wouldn’t say pushed them. I think maybe pushed them to think about other alternatives. And sometimes it’s not just about us. It's about connecting them maybe to other founders. We also brought people that were, back in 2008 so the previous recession, and had to overcome that. So, it's not just about what I know, what I think. It's about sort of being sort of their advisor and shepherding them through the process. And do you approach this optimistically, pessimistically, or realistically? What's your position at the dinner table with your founding team? You know there's no pessimist in the world there's only optimist and realist. Right? I think as a venture capitalist, as a founder you have to have some heavy dose of optimism. Right? It makes no sense to start a company and try to battle these incredible giants or overcome of the obstacle. So, you need to have this level of optimism. So, we do go into it. But at the same time you need to plan for the worst and the worst is you need to have 18, 24 months of runway for example. And not just say, "You know, this will be a V-shaped recovery and in three months everything will be fine." You know what? Let's all hope so that’s the case but let's plan for it not being whatsoever that. Amazing. Gil, what excites you? After nine years, thousands of potential deals, 82 investments. What gets you up in the morning? What are you really really excited about? Lots of things. I don't think I'm one of those investors that says, "This domain or that domain." I think for me it really comes to the people that we meet at a coffee shop, on the corner of Rothschild Avenue and something in Tel Aviv. When they only have the gleam in their eyes and they just started and it's about trying to see if sort of we can help guide them through come to the US and growing their business to become what we think it can become. So, I think it's that optimism, that belief, those early days, the process, the ups, the downs. I think the journey itself is what excites me. Certainly new technologies impact on the world I am completely on board. But it's I think being part of the journey of one person against the world, quote unquote that I like being part of. And how would you describe your engagement with them? Some VCs are very hands-off, take my money and leave. Sort of dumb money. Some of them are, come sit in our offices giving a small ... but how do you approach this relationship of yours with your portfolio companies at such an early stage? Yeah. Look, I think each investor wants to contribute. I think each investor plays a different role. So, at the very beginning we are almost always the first and only money in the company. So, it's about typically guiding them in the right direction. Avoiding making big mistakes. Helping them make some decision that early on. Helping them to find additional investor that can invest. And overtime that evolves because now they have different advisors that bring something else to the table. So, for us we have to ask ourselves "Okay, how do we change our position and advice to compliment some of the other people that are supporting the CEO and the founders?" So, even our role changes over time. No totally, but at the end also, I got to be in the Upwest offices quite a few times at this point. It's practically my second home outside of the Stanford dorms. You walk in and you see five, six different companies sitting in their tables talking to each other. All friends. Everybody's so nice. It's kind of like a hub. It reminds me of the Google campus that was back in Electra Building you know a few years ago where you walk in and there's this electricity and fire. And it doesn’t look like it’s a VC office. It looks like it’s a workspace where you're not just giving money to the portfolio companies. You're actually giving mentorship and friendship. And a community for them to work together in the heart of Silicon Valley which is not, away from Tel Aviv where they get to be with other Israelis right in the same room. Yeah. Two things about it. You're completely right. First of all the community. Critical word for us. It's about founders going, share their experiences that actually are pretty unique to them when you think about it. You move to the US. You come with you're significant other with kids. Many of them. That's not easy whatsoever. So, you share the experiences, both companies at the same stage but also those that came one, two, five years ahead of you. So, we make sure to bring all that to the table. But the second thing is, we absolutely make sure that folks are not sort of sitting within themselves. It's about pushing them out immersing in the ecosystem. Just because the culture of the business here can be at first challenging and not that straightforward to understand. I'm still figuring it out. Right? So, almost a couple of decades onwards. So, it's about definitely being out there. It's very easy to get in to your shell and be with your own folks but you absolutely have to be out there to succeed. Definitely. Are things changing in the VC world? What's happening? Are things have been the same over the past few decades? Where do you see things going forward not just with Upwest but general venture capital relationship with entrepreneurs let's say in the next decade? Yeah. I don’t know if I'm smart enough to sort of see the next decade, but there's definitely in the last 10 years plus have been some definite big changes. I think the definition of venture capital has changed what VCs bring to the table. Many firms have taken that to add lots of experiences and value adds in various ways so it's not just the partners in the fund. Funds of all sizes. Right? In the past seed funds, What is a seed fund? Anything below 50 100 didn’t make any sense. Now you have super ... seed funds. That happened a decade ago. So, began at least really fantastic funds there. Obviously the soft bank phenomena and funds not raising 300 but 3 billion and even 100 billion as we saw. So, things have changed a lot. But the covid hasn’t evolved which is trying to get conviction about a team hoping that they get conviction about you because you are about to spend seven to 10 years working together. Hopefully. So, you want this mutual respect - exactly hopefully - mutual respect, mutual ability to work together. So, finding those partnerships founders is not easy. It actually shouldn’t be easy. It's a big decision for both sides. That hasn’t changed. Right. Gil, now I'm talking as the young entrepreneur. I get to surround myself with incredible other young entrepreneurs much smarter than me both from 8200 and Stanford. I'm just amazed by the things that some of them are doing. And it's very confusing. There's a lot of options. A lot of places to go. How does a young entrepreneur balance their journey? On one hand there's this pride and I'm gonna go raise money and I'm gonna finish my culminator and raise the biggest seed round I can raise. The other hand you have the more conservative approach of, I'm not sure that I need money. I can maybe bootstrap this or maybe I'm looking for specific strategic investors. So, how does a young entrepreneur like myself navigate through all these options and what's the most important thing to keep in mind as I'm building my team, as I'm building my strategy to eventually make a big impact? Good question. So, first of all there's no one way. Right? There’s no one way that treats everything. For young founders, I think it's about surrounding yourself with the right set of advisors, of friends, and experiences that you gather along the way and see what works for you. Sometimes it's about getting you're knowledgeable about business that you're super passionate about and you can make it into a bootstrap and you can work with it before fundraising if at all. Sometimes you have maybe some technical skills, a unique team that you put together that you really have to raise a meaningful seed to show something meaningful at the early stage. So, there's no one answer. But I think I would encourage everyone to, especially in Stanford, make those internships count during the years, during the summer. Make them as diverse as human impossible. Reach out to people. Have coffee chat, coffee chats. I actually, I think as my journey took me here, I spoke to many dozens of venture capitalists before even knowing what that is and deciding to jump into the deep end. And this is 10 years post MBA. So, I took full advantage of my person network, my business profession networks, to just talk to people and see what they say and what they've learned and their experiences. And then figure out the right path for me. And the right path for me was not to join a big VC, but we had the opportunity to start our own, Shuly and me, and bootstrap it if you can believe it at the very beginning. So, that was the answer for us. Does that mean that's the answer for everyone in our profession? No. Sure. Yeah no It seems like there is a growing trend where relationships are not so much about the long term but its more about what can you offer me today so that and I can offer you something tomorrow which is kind of disheartening and you see it with a competitive nature, I think. Sometimes at a place like Stanford there’s a lot others who are very interested in forming these personal relationships. I value them a lot and that's why I love doing what we're doing here and getting to know you over these years and hopefully one day I can be in front of you and I'll be one of the thousands decks that you receive in your mailbox. So, hopefully sooner than later. Gil, last thoughts about where are you headed with this? Do you see yourself continuing with Upwest, growing it into a massive VC? Do you see yourself navigating potentially to other areas? What's up with you? So, as much as I can help it and control things this is the last job I wanna be doing, right. ... anything else. It's our startup. Right? This is our startup. This is a startup? Upwest is a startup. We bootstrap it. We raise money from people. We're trying to grow to a certain extent. But that's sort of what we do. Right? I even asked you in the email. I asked you I thought that we might talk about being a VC versus starting a startup but you're actually starting a startup while doing a VC. Yeah. So, and I absolutely treat it that way. I'm going forward. We're doing a scale a little bit. But ultimately what will guide us is we wanna invest in very early stage startups founded by Israelis, whoever they are, and help them break into the US market. If we raise too much money, it doesn’t make sense to write a pre-seed or seed check. We now have to be a serious A fund which a.) is less fun for me b.) there's so many better investors. So many better investors than us to do it. So, we wanna specialize in being that first check. And so, we have to right size the fund so we can’t raise too much. Right? Gil, three words that best describe you and now I'm ready for the cheating. So, the cheating is I'm a big fan of hyphens. I will be hyphenating a little bit here. So, on sort of the business side, I aspired to be a trusted advisor. So, that's a hyphenated word. That's what I would like to continue to be and aspire to be and hopefully I can continue perfecting that. On a personal level, as you see me sitting in e pink room here, I will take on the description of a simple, of like a father. I'm still figuring it out and will likely figure it out for a long time. So, that would be my second word and I didn’t cheat here. That's not hyphenated. I love it. So, it looks kind of white but now I'll make it clear this is a pink room. Gil, is sitting in your daughter's room, right? Yeah, light pink room. Exactly. And then the third, I didn’t know what to say. So, I'll just go with, and this is absolutely hyphenated ... I'm a proud dual citizen of Israel and the US. But where I grew up, my roots is from ... and what that means to me is community, family, and that is where I'm from and where I started. And frankly, all my family, cousins, aunts, about 40 close members of my family all live five minutes from one another. Walking distance. And I'm the only one who isn’t. So, I'm like the black sheep of the family. But yeah, that's what hyphenated values to describe myself. Gil, toda raba. Best of luck. It sounds amazing. And look for my email with the deck in one or two years. Thank you so much. Thank you for having me. Take care.
