1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,119
I feel like I'm just using and abusing

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,239
technology just to make a business.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,719
So, like with software,

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,640
think about like software,

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,719
you can make copies of it

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,900
and it doesn't cost you anything.

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,359
Stephen Blum, thank you

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,599
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,639
It's been almost seven years

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,119
since we worked together last through

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,759
the Hacking Generation Y company

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,479
that I ran.

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,080
How are you?

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,199
So good.

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,839
Amazing.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,839
That was the same response

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,959
you gave me seven years ago.

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,520
So, I'm glad that

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,760
I feel so much has changed

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,440
and then you're being consistent.

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,280
So, I just love that.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:03,979
Stephen, you're the

23
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:05,599
chief technology officer of PubNub.

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,000
I am incredibly excited to learn more

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,120
about what you guys are doing

26
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,840
and diving into some of the things

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,040
that really make you excited about

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,240
the technology your developing.

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,640
But before that, I always love starting

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,000
with the journey of the entrepreneur

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,360
and the journey of the leader.

32
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,840
Because you have a phenomenal journey.

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,960
You've worked at quite a few companies

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,960
as lead as senior developer

35
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,519
and architecture.

36
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,719
So, tell me a little bit about

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,759
what you're passionate about

38
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,559
and take me all the way back

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,439
to your college days.

40
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,439
How do you get excited about technology

41
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,480
to the point where you are now?

42
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,840
Oh wow.

43
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,160
Yeah. It's a lot, yeah.

44
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,280
Really, it's all about

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,560
that means to an end.

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,948
So, technology,

47
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,520
sure, it's great.

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,240
And it can get you

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,440
to where you want to go.

50
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:51,439
From what gets me excited,

51
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,799
what really excites me

52
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,400
is that business model.

53
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:54,600
Right.

54
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:56,999
I'm really attracted that business model.

55
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,679
Yeah, attract that repeatable opinion.

56
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,199
You don't hear that so much

57
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,359
from chief technology officers, right?

58
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:03,599
Yeah.

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,079
That's actually a good point.

60
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,079
And I feel like I'm,

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,039
I'm just using and abusing technology

62
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,559
just to make a business.

63
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,039
So, like with software,

64
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,919
think about like software,

65
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:18,039
you can make copies of it

66
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,760
and it doesn't cost you anything.

67
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,399
I like that idea.

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,639
That means production costs

69
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,999
are pretty dang low.

70
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,679
So, how can we make that a business

71
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,399
and then how can we make

72
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,640
that easily consumable?

73
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,760
If you just press a button

74
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,280
and you magically gets a PubNub,

75
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,199
for example,

76
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,400
that's like the best possible business.

77
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,840
Because it's like money in,

78
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,440
easy, no problem.

79
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,920
And it takes a little bit more than that

80
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,400
with a company, like PubNub,

81
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:45,479
there's of course, that freemium model,

82
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:45,840
right?

83
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,240
So, it's like gives you the taste,

84
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,920
make sure that

85
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,320
it's what you're looking for

86
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,320
and gives you that aha moment.

87
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,440
Oh wait a second,

88
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,560
I didn't know that's something

89
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,000
that could be done?

90
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,840
Like that's what one

91
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,720
of my challenges is

92
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,680
trying to educate the market, saying,

93
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,840
this is something that you can do.

94
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,440
And especially now

95
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,560
with a lot of the work from home,

96
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,360
we've seen a massive increase

97
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,720
in our graph of traffic gaps.

98
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,920
Since you started on PubNub,

99
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,040
what is PubNub?

100
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,320
What service are you providing

101
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:14,599
and what is that aha moment

102
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,080
that you're referring to

103
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,040
that people already in the

104
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,040
freemium model are getting?

105
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,520
Yeah.

106
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,640
So, we're a communications platform

107
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,560
that allows multiplayer gaming,

108
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,120
or delivery

109
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:29,959
or peloton bike experiences

110
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,080
where you shared in a classroom.

111
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,280
And there's just so many,

112
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,360
like we have delivery services that uses,

113
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,320
it tracks the car on the map

114
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,040
as it's going by, like,

115
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,960
How close is my Chipotle order?

116
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,680
I'm hungry.

117
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,680
I want it, I need it now.

118
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,840
So, that's the kinds of things

119
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,080
that we take care of.

120
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,560
And we do it really, we're better

121
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,240
than everyone else doing it.

122
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,160
And we've got,

123
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,760
we're actually the world record holders

124
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,160
in the largest online events.

125
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,840
Yes.

126
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,440
What does that mean?

127
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,240
Tell me about these

128
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,120
world record holder holdings.

129
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,440
For the largest number of concurrent

130
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,320
audience members in history,

131
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,520
in human history,

132
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,360
we hold four sporting events

133
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,160
in a subsidiary of Disney.

134
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,880
We powered their televised event

135
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,760
and millions,

136
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,480
tens of millions of viewers

137
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,720
were all connected

138
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,120
with the shared experience

139
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,640
powered through our network.

140
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,720
It's sort of like

141
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,160
a nice little badge of honor

142
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,280
that we have,

143
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,080
that we've achieved.

144
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,600
Stephen, You're sitting either

145
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,880
at home if it's covid,

146
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,640
or in your office

147
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,000
if it's the regular life.

148
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,720
And in real time,

149
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,760
you have tens of millions of people

150
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,680
that are getting their data,

151
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,560
getting their experience

152
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,880
through PubNub.

153
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,880
And it's a technology

154
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,160
that you're responsible for.

155
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,880
You are the leader of it.

156
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,760
You're holding the technology stack.

157
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:46,960
Right?

158
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,400
Is that scary?

159
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,240
Is that fun?

160
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,640
Oh, it's exciting.

161
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,480
There's just so much.

162
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,720
But it's also a little,

163
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,120
like you're saying, scary.

164
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,280
Yeah, because we actually

165
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:03,759
we power airports

166
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,360
in the fueling of planes

167
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,880
and we make phones ring

168
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,560
and really important messages

169
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,440
that go through the system

170
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,240
and we can't lose them.

171
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,720
Like if we lose them,

172
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,440
some catastrophe is awaiting.

173
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,400
And we have to keep innovating.

174
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,000
We have to keep software moving.

175
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:25,759
So, we have to build a system

176
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,560
that is able to be updated

177
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,920
while not dropping a single message.

178
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,720
That's hard.

179
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,360
That's scary.

180
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,400
That's challenging.

181
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,800
And that's what we're doing

182
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,080
and that's what we're really good at.

183
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,200
You mentioned the term,

184
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,960
"educating the market" before.

185
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,040
Actually, a lot of the things

186
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,640
that you've been referring to

187
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,720
in this talk so far,

188
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,200
I feel like I think that I've been

189
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,600
learning through all these different

190
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,560
entrepreneurial courses at Stanford

191
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:52,799
or venture capital courses

192
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,960
or entrepreneurial courses

193
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,600
and Andreessen Horowitz articles,

194
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:56,439
and you've condensed that

195
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,799
into your PubNub journey,

196
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,960
which I think is just inspiring.

197
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,840
What is educating the market to you

198
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:03,279
and how did you need to educate

199
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,679
the markets to get PubNub

200
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,879
to where it is today?

201
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,600
So, it's the same challenge

202
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:10,839
with every company.

203
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,919
It doesn't really matter if you have

204
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,120
a very specific product or sort of

205
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,720
a horizontal communications network

206
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,240
like we have,

207
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,760
the challenge is finding a way

208
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,440
to communicate with a specific industry

209
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,800
in this case.

210
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,280
So, how I was describing

211
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,720
the car in the map

212
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,400
that's going through,

213
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,240
you can see how close

214
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,520
your Chipotle order is.

215
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,800
You need to have those stories.

216
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,000
You need to relay them

217
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,240
in a digital fashion

218
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,360
in a way that's consumable

219
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,520
for your audience,

220
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,840
your target audience.

221
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,160
Right.

222
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,960
That's like the hardest part.

223
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,760
And it also feels

224
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,520
scary to do that

225
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,920
because now you're,

226
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,080
you're like siloing your market.

227
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,680
And it's like,

228
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,800
but we're only going to capture

229
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,520
this level of revenue.

230
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,320
And then it's like,

231
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,400
what about all this other

232
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,680
sea of revenue over here?

233
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,080
You're leaving it on the table?

234
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:58,079
Actually, no, you're not,

235
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,040
because you're going to laser focus

236
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,760
and you're going to nail that target.

237
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,920
You're going to get those customers

238
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,840
to that aha moment.

239
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,360
You're going to be able to bring in

240
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,840
more qualified leads and then

241
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,920
you can take that pattern.

242
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:10,559
And this is a cool part,

243
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,360
this is the part I love, I love this,

244
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,480
you can repeat it,

245
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,400
you can repeat that pattern and go after

246
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:16,799
all the rest of those industries

247
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,280
and all those markets and win

248
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,600
at a much better rate.

249
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,800
And that's critical.

250
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,880
You have to do that verticalization.

251
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,320
So, from what I understand,

252
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,600
a lot of the majority of people fail

253
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
at that laser focus part, right?

254
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,320
So, they may have a good product,

255
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,160
they have a good idea,

256
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,120
they have a good sense of the market,

257
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,440
but they fail to have that laser focus.

258
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,960
And I'm thinking back to

259
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,360
first run article about superhuman,

260
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,440
where they talk about how they,

261
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,640
how they nailed down

262
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,280
on their target market

263
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,440
and really were laser focused.

264
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,800
What was that experience like for you?

265
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,440
How do you become laser focused

266
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:55,480
on a specific submarket of the

267
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,479
submarket?

268
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,479
It's trial and error,

269
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,039
but also, if there's a bigger hurdle,

270
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,399
it's ourselves.

271
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,359
It's ourselves.

272
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,319
Because convincing ourselves to do it,

273
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,719
is the biggest challenge.

274
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,399
And we're a big team, right?

275
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,879
And a lot of folks are responsible

276
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,239
for getting those key metrics successful.

277
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,040
Right?

278
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,039
We have targets and goals

279
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,280
and we have to hit those.

280
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
And then if you just focus

281
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
on one particular area,

282
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
it's worrisome.

283
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,040
So, trying to get us all

284
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,720
on the same page to do that,

285
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,800
that's been the number one challenge.

286
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,040
It's the hardest part.

287
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,880
I love it.

288
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,560
Stephen, take me back 10 years.

289
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,600
You're starting out PubNub,

290
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,640
what was it like?

291
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,880
Tell me the founding story of PubNub.

292
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,440
So, I've always been entrepreneurial.

293
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,000
My family, my grandfather,

294
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,120
they owned a local business

295
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,400
in the city and they sold

296
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,880
pipe fittings and in other types

297
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,320
of utility systems.

298
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,880
I don't know if that inspired me

299
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,240
or ingrained me into just being,

300
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,120
oh, this is the way it needs to be.

301
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,720
We just have a business

302
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:07,719
and you go for it.

303
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,920
And finding like, an approach,

304
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,960
I always had that a desire.

305
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,920
So PubNub, just like,

306
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,840
oh, this is a new way,

307
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,520
here's a problem.

308
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,120
This phone over here,

309
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,280
like I want this phone

310
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,840
to talk to that thing over there.

311
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,080
And I want it to be as easy as possible.

312
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,240
How can I make that possible?

313
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,160
How can I do that?

314
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,000
Well, I didn't know much

315
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,960
about networking.

316
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,160
I didn't know much about,

317
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,520
it was like,

318
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:33,959
how can I make that easy?

319
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,400
Okay, I need to learn about this.

320
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,760
I need to learn about Linux Kernel APIs.

321
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,040
I need to learn about networking,

322
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,800
what is an Ethernet frame,

323
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,040
what's a TCP tuple,

324
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,240
can we do UDP,

325
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,680
what is that,

326
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,880
what is even that, right?

327
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,640
So, I had to figure all that stuff out.

328
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,200
I didn't know

329
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,640
but I wanted it to be the best.

330
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,680
I wanted it to have, like

331
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,160
all these technologies out there

332
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,960
that allowed you to do

333
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,640
communication had limitations.

334
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,120
Right.

335
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,360
Like the AT&T network,

336
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,640
they have so much hardware

337
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,079
because the software has limited

338
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,920
and like, I don't want that limit.

339
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,400
When I make phone ring

340
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,160
across the world,

341
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
I don't want it to wait three seconds

342
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,520
because it has to go

343
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,160
through all these switching boards.

344
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,400
I want it to do as soon as you press

345
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:24,959
your finger on the phone,

346
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,520
the call button,

347
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,400
I want it to ring on the other side.

348
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,040
Like that's what my goal was.

349
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,480
So, like having that objective

350
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,080
for high quality and efficient,

351
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,640
and then being able to sell it as well

352
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,240
without having any overhead,

353
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,480
that was the goal.

354
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,600
Like creating a business

355
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,760
that could do that

356
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,520
and get people really excited.

357
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
And then I could take it

358
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,200
and then show people

359
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,680
how cool it was

360
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,200
on every single possible use case.

361
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,280
That was the vision.

362
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,120
That was the driver.

363
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,880
So, I'm going back to the beginning.

364
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,920
You're saying the technology for you

365
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,320
as the chief technology officer

366
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,319
is a means to an end.

367
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,440
You're really excited about the impact

368
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,720
that you're able to make,

369
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,880
whether it's connecting tens of millions

370
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,560
of people and a single point in time

371
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,120
or over the span of ten years,

372
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,240
really educating the market

373
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,080
and becoming a market leader

374
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:11,399
in this multiplayer communication.

375
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,720
So, back then, when you're talking about,

376
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,160
figuring out TCP, UDP, Ethernet frames,

377
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,520
I mean, that's complicated stuff.

378
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,960
That's not the stuff

379
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,440
that the average person would just,

380
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,120
you know, on their Friday night

381
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,600
sift through Wikipedia

382
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,120
and research papers and learn about.

383
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,040
So, there has to be a deep

384
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,280
technological curiosity beyond

385
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,600
just the means to an end, right?

386
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,280
You would think?

387
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,440
Maybe.

388
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,160
So, like, would I do this for fun

389
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,640
just for the hack of it, right?

390
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,280
Like, that would be

391
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,280
kind of like the question.

392
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,959
Maybe.

393
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,920
I mean, I did some game development

394
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,800
back in the day and I thought

395
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,320
that was pretty cool, right,

396
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,360
getting into video games.

397
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,680
You're breaking the whole conception

398
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,440
of what I think

399
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,960
of a chief technology officer.

400
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,520
Stephen, this is very difficult for me.

401
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,240
Yeah.

402
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,760
I mean, I think,

403
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,360
no matter what your like approaches

404
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,160
and your stance on technology

405
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,280
and in your field as well,

406
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,120
I think it comes down to

407
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,600
what's driving you,

408
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,360
what's pushing you forward,

409
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,320
what's going to make sure

410
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,280
that you're succeeding

411
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,480
and you're always at the forefront.

412
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,000
It happens that technology

413
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,200
has to be there

414
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,680
in order for you to accomplish it.

415
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,160
If it was wizardry and magic,

416
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,240
I would probably,

417
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,680
I'd probably be doing that.

418
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,440
But this is as close as we get

419
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,120
to get technology.

420
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,960
So, Andreessen wrote the famous piece,

421
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,200
Software is eating the World.

422
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,000
You're evidently a key figure

423
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,280
in proving that

424
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,880
software is eating the world.

425
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,320
I love the analogy that you made to AT&Ts

426
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,880
hardware solution versus

427
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,240
a software solution.

428
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,200
Obviously Andreessen,

429
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,720
that's what he touches on,

430
00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:56,359
the type that you can scale

431
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,360
at practically no cost

432
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,920
and get exponential increase in usage

433
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,520
for a relatively linear increase in cost.

434
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,440
I mean, that's the name of the game.

435
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,960
But it must not be that smooth

436
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,200
of a journey over 10 years.

437
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:12,199
It can't all be butterflies and muscles.

438
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,399
Right?

439
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,359
So, talk to me some of the hurdles

440
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,279
that you pass through

441
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,159
and how you overcame them?

442
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,279
Well, we have our software,

443
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,919
and we are human we make mistakes,

444
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,880
but we're really good at

445
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:27,119
realizing those mistakes.

446
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,879
And that's probably like

447
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,240
the best part of humanity is like,

448
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,880
I would say,

449
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:33,159
that's our strongest asset.

450
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,879
Right?

451
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,879
It's being able to recognize mistakes

452
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,520
and fixing them.

453
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,839
And we're not infallible.

454
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,079
We've made mistakes.

455
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,559
Some of our client SDKs

456
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,760
are connectors to our network

457
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,840
were running on AT&T phones.

458
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,440
And there was an upgrade that they made

459
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,800
which caused some sort of

460
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,560
incompatibility thing, and the device

461
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,680
connect and disconnect

462
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,720
over and over and over.

463
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,680
And we had to create new

464
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,000
cipher keys every single connection,

465
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,400
because we want to make sure

466
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,320
the connection is secure.

467
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,800
And then it cost,

468
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,400
and it was a slow rollout

469
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,560
and they didn't upgrade,

470
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,600
and eventually all the phones,

471
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,880
all the AT&T phones in America

472
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,440
were doing this.

473
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,760
They were doing connect, disconnect

474
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,240
over and over.

475
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,160
And we're like, "What's going on?"

476
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,440
We didn't have any logging

477
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,120
at layer five and we didn't know,

478
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,360
we just saw that

479
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,120
the CPU's are going through the roof.

480
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,080
"What's going on? What's going on?"

481
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,040
It turned out that we had

482
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,800
a faulty reconnect logic

483
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:38,159
inside of our SDK,

484
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,280
for the particular SDK

485
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,720
that AT&T was using on their phones.

486
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,320
And in order to solve that,

487
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,680
we to get all AT&T's IP block space

488
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,720
that they owned for the cell network

489
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,760
and then route them

490
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,840
to a specific destination.

491
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,600
So, that way we can get

492
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,920
the rest of the traffic healthy.

493
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,240
So, that happened this year,

494
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,280
that was this year.

495
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,400
Yeah.

496
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,960
And it was very tragic

497
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,920
and it was very heartbreaking.

498
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,000
And we did harm

499
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,520
some of our customer relationships

500
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,840
but we were able to figure out

501
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,320
what the problem was and we solved it.

502
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,840
And in the future,

503
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,560
if we run into this again,

504
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,240
we have the tools ready.

505
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,000
Right.

506
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,959
I love going back to what you said,

507
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,440
that as humanity, we're really good

508
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,600
as identifying the mistakes

509
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,120
we're making and hopefully solving them.

510
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,560
I don't think that, you know,

511
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,360
all of humanity is good at doing that.

512
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,880
I can think of a few examples

513
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,600
who we're not necessarily good

514
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,360
at doing that.

515
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,320
But I love the fact

516
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,120
that you are taking the lessons

517
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,600
and being very direct about it,

518
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,040
being very intentional about the lessons

519
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,320
that you've learned there.

520
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,640
Owning that mistake

521
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,800
and improving upon it.

522
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,920
And I think that's the responsibility

523
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,840
of being a leader and a market leader

524
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,880
and something as crucial

525
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,800
as multiplayer communication.

526
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,520
What were some of the most

527
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,080
enjoyable moments of this 10 year journey

528
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,840
as an entrepreneur?

529
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,160
That's working with the customers,

530
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,360
that's still is today.

531
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,120
Being able to see them like,

532
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,720
wow, is it really that easy? Yeah.

533
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,680
If I could make it easier,

534
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,040
I would.

535
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,440
And I am working on that right now,

536
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,560
making it easier, faster,

537
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,960
better, stronger.

538
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,200
We're not done yet.

539
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,480
Like some of our biggest customers

540
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,440
are multiplayer games for mobile phones.

541
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,120
They're huge and they have

542
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,640
the largest player base

543
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,720
and the most loyal player bases around.

544
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,760
And so,

545
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,560
we need to make sure they're happy

546
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,080
because we want to keep their revenues

547
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,320
growing as well.

548
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,960
They are our customers revenue

549
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,440
and just being able to provide that,

550
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,360
and say this is us,

551
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,280
we can do that for you

552
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,400
is very satisfying.

553
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,040
It's very satisfying.

554
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Right.

555
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Are there some lessons that you learned

556
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,039
as a technology leader in the company?

557
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,960
Because you're were both,

558
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,760
obviously, you're leading people,

559
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,040
but you're also leading technology,

560
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,400
and sometimes it feels that there's this

561
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,760
like, weird intermixing between

562
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,840
the different roles of being the CEO,

563
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,080
the CTO, especially in

564
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,120
record technology companies,

565
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,960
how do you look at your role

566
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,760
as a CTO in terms of leadership?

567
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,680
By example, I would say probably.

568
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,560
I mean, I kind of like

569
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,280
think of it from that.

570
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,360
I mean, if you're kind of going down,

571
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,720
because there's different flavors of CTOs

572
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,360
if you ask.

573
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,880
And this is actually

574
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,120
a common questions like,

575
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,640
"What do you do as CTO?"

576
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,840
Those kinds of things.

577
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,720
Like, what are you asking really?

578
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,280
Like, what are you trying to get at?

579
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,920
Usually these are

580
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,280
other technology folks

581
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,600
who are asking me this question

582
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,240
that are either in that role

583
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,840
or about to go in that role.

584
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,600
And it's very different.

585
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,120
Some are our VPs of engineering

586
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,440
and they operate the team

587
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,040
and sort of manage managers

588
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,120
and sort of help structure that out

589
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,720
and create like

590
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,280
trajectories and career paths.

591
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,960
Right?

592
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:51,319
There's that kind.

593
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,960
There's also innovators, right?

594
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,400
So, at a larger companies,

595
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,320
you've got these principal engineers

596
00:17:57,321 --> 00:18:02,319
or CTOs and they look for the frontier.

597
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,039
They're like,

598
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,799
what's new,

599
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,160
what's amazing,

600
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:07,519
what can we do to our company

601
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,799
to make it more secure,

602
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,759
make it billion dollars richer

603
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,240
with modern technologies,

604
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:16,239
how can we inject those techs into it.

605
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,639
And so, for me, though,

606
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,999
I'm an entrepreneur,

607
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,439
like I said, a little different.

608
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,439
So, I focus on what can we do,

609
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,159
what metrics can we monitor

610
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,239
over the years

611
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,719
and for our teams to be able

612
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,999
to be more successful.

613
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,560
Right?

614
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,720
And to know that they're successful

615
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,280
even before they get like a review.

616
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,560
The annual review type situation.

617
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,200
How do we do that?

618
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,000
How do we make the business scale?

619
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,400
How do we solve training?

620
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:43,960
Right.

621
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,840
Because for us, though, it's really hard

622
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,360
because the language is different.

623
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,760
Yeah.

624
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,120
Every single customer

625
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,520
they come to us so, like,

626
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,680
we need real time geography map updates.

627
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,320
And now you've got

628
00:18:56,321 --> 00:18:57,519
a wholly different than

629
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,519
multiplayer connectivity.

630
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,760
And I need to make sure that

631
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,080
we have these technologies

632
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,040
and we can filter these

633
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,080
and we have this number,

634
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,760
it's just a different

635
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,800
conversation each time.

636
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,920
So, it's hard.

637
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,160
So, that's the kind of things

638
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,640
that we solve.

639
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,040
I love that.

640
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,200
Stephen, I wish we could talk on

641
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,480
for another hour about this.

642
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,320
It's just so fascinating.

643
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,520
But unfortunately,

644
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:15,399
for some weird reason,

645
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,080
I called the show

646
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,440
20 minute leaders instead of

647
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,400
hour minute leaders.

648
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,960
So, thank you for being so generous

649
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
with your time.

650
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,520
I love to end with my favorite question,

651
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,760
which is three words that you would use

652
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,600
to describe yourself.

653
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,480
Wait, that's like,

654
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,440
that's a really hard one to do.

655
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,600
You should have prepared me

656
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,120
for that one.

657
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,760
Maybe you did

658
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,880
and I didn't read the email.

659
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,640
I apologize for that.

660
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,040
But it is my favorite question

661
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,280
I'm not holding you accountable

662
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,480
for those three words.

663
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,280
Off the top of your mind,

664
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,560
what words come to you when you think of

665
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,640
what is the type of leader you are?

666
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,640
How would your co-founder

667
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,920
think of Stephen Blum?

668
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,680
Realization and overly excited.

669
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm holding back.

670
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:05,479
I'm holding back right now.

671
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,839
I love that.

672
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,519
Stephen, thank you so much.

673
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,719
This is wonderful, really inspiring.

674
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,479
And I love following your journey.

675
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,799
Thank you for being a great supporter

676
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,719
seven years ago of my projects.

677
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,760
I'm very, very thankful for that.

678
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,240
And stay safe and stay healthy

679
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,160
throughout this pandemic.

680
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,160
Yeah, it's been great, thank you.

681
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,000
Thank you for the time.

682
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,040
And same to you.

683
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,760
Thank you very much.
