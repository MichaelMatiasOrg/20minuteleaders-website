1 Eli Bildner, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. It is such a pleasure to have you here. It is a pleasure to be here. Thanks so much for having me. Where are you calling from? Oakland California. Not too far. Oakland California. Wonderful. I'm in Southern California. So definitely not too far. But I'm originally in Maui situated in Palo Alto. So, Eli, 20 minutes is not gonna do nearly enough justice for everything that I wanna cover from Yale, to Stanford MBA to early employee at Coursera Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and Bloomberg Philanthropies, working on education and housing. Oh my God. Where do we even start? Eli, where do we start? I don't know man. You tell me. All right. Let's start from growth of a tech. Move to philanthropy. And then let's talk about this non-linear nature of your career. Because just before we started this, we started talking about this idea that you know, today people don't have to choose a linear path. So, you know. Talk to me about being an early employee at Coursera. Andrew Ng is one of the role model of mine. Talk to me a little bit about what you were doing there and the grow that you help lead. Yeah. Totally. Andrew is a great guy. Everyone's got this sort of early embarrassing early career memories. I wasn’t so young when I was at Coursera. I traveled with Andrew at China a couple times as we were trying to build a business there. Oh yeah, Fulbright in China. I forgot to mention that. Yeah, this background in China, and yeah I can tell you all about that in a second. But I was having a little bit of a tough time emotionally Just not share about what I was doing And I was having dinner with Andrew and I just kinda like broke down and cry. I was sitting there with Andrew and I feel challenged in China and he was comforting me and try to like, He's a really caring and sweet guy. And a great leader, and obviously an incredible thinker. But I had a very fond sort of personal memory with him. I really respect him. Well then, I would share that one of my life's goals is to have a crying session with Andrew Ng. Yeah, but it can happen. There's hope for you yet. Yeah. So, I mean maybe they connect the career piece that I've experienced at Coursera piece. I ended up taking a job at Coursera early on and really not without much kind of strategy behind it. I was really interested in what would mean for the way people access education to change. I've been involve in starting in a very early stages in Online Coding Bootcamp and, And one thing I didn’t appreciate coming to Coursera is that, at an early company where there is so much growth, like really, you end up dictating your role as much as the company does. And I came in with this experience having worked in China. Really, couple of months after I join, Coursera is starting to think about other opportunities for us in China. And it turns out that I was really the only one in the company who had business development and partnership experience in China. And so I was tap into this. And you speak Mandarin. I speak Mandarin maybe more fluently at the time. And I was tap to getting help project managers effort and that and became a big part of my role. So, it definitely something I try to share with people who are thinking about kind of early stage career is that whenever you come in to a role, you have to think about what is in your portfolio. Even if it’s not something that was in the job description you signed up for when you're younger probably. Particularly at that stage of a company. There are a lot of opportunities to to bring out that stuff to there. So, I came to Coursera and then, I was there from 2013 thru late 2015. And then went to Stanford to do an MBA. And saw Coursera grow from 40 people 34, 40 people to probably 200 And really interesting time in the company. And in the world. And then, after Coursera, I've done some work in Philanthropy before. But sort of have since I graduate business school, I have work more in a non-profit and philanthropy. And I'm happy to talk about frozen times of those two very different worlds. But I've seen both sides of that. How do you go from seeing a great company growing so fast. A lot of it under also your initiatives. And then you're going to business school which inherently business school, it's business and a lot of the business school classes I really hope one day I'll be able to do that as well. Yeah. I heard about the touchy-feely class of the GSB. And all of these different experiences. It doesn’t seem like they are guiding necessarily for philanthropy and for non-profits. Where did that even come from? Yeah, I mean there are probably, I don’t know, fewer than five people in my class of 400 who went into non-profits. or is operating non-profits. So, not a huge focus. Although there's a lot at Stanford around social innovation, and yeah there's a lot of good exposure there. But it's not part of the culture and part of it either. But one thing that I learn at Coursera that is stuck with me, is that company loved to talk about their social mission and their impact. and are mission-driven company. And like you know, I think truth be told, but a lot of the time that Can I get to say this on the show? [--], it's like more marketing than anything. Definitely. Yeah, I worked at a community non-profit now. But I also like, I mean there's nothing wrong with running a successful business. And serving customers. And serving employees well. And how you run it really matters. And you don’t need address that I put this whole like you know Or mission driven Fintech company working on payment solutions. Well yeah, I'm sure it's good for the world Just own it like you're a great company. You know, there's nothing wrong with that. So, and yeah, what I came to believe through my work at kind of mission-driven community, I really respect Coursera, is that, if you're a poor profit and particularly venture back company You know, you're always gonna be my grading towards your highest growth and highest margin of opportunities. And at Coursera, that meant like Coursera was never been, it gonna be a company that was focused on serving the most vulnerable people in the world. That just not what it was built to do. It was built to scale really quickly. Through venture capital. And through technology. And grow, and migrate towards the best business opportunity to the company which have turned out to be in a corporate learning and development and traditional degree programs. I believe that's great. I really believe in what Coursera is doing in the world. I'm really proud of having that I'm part of the company. I love the people there but It's not enough that, you know. Our economy does not solve necessarily for the problems of the those traditionally underserved and most vulnerable in the population that's it with that. So, I knew, coming out of my experience at Coursera, that I wanted to think more, and work more on inker on a population as oppose to inkering on a business model and non-profits are really good at that. I love it. Yeah. I think it's incredible. And I think this take on impact, and what really needs to be solved. That’s really inspiring. But then, you go. And you actually join some of the most notable organization in the world for this type of work. You tell me a little bit about this Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. And what you would doing there? And then the Bloomberg Philanthropy. Yeah, I've always been a big fan of China. You know, create your own career opportunities. And so much just have to do with timing. And during my MBA's summer, I was just thinking about what to do. I got connected from a friend and a mentor to someone who is basically that kind of chief of staff for intern idea of Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan. The Philanthropy which hadn't launch then. And she was helping them stand it up. And so I became their first, Oh, it was just starting back then. It just starting. Yeah. I became their first intern. And I think I just always been drawn to a kind of this early stage experiences But I think philanthropy, you know, each sector I've been involved in whether it's businesses, whether its philanthropy, whether its operating non-profits, they all have an important role. And one thing that’s very powerful about philanthropy is its convening power. Its agenda setting power. Sort of like the medium that way. And that it's remarkable how little money it takes to change a conversation. Or to create a conversation. And so, I'm really What does that mean? So, like as an example particularly with public actors, or state governments, local governments, and even the federal government there's so little, and even companies You know, very very few companies organizations, policy actors have discretionary money just lying around. And so, if you're one of these actors, you wanna try something really new. You really have very few places to turn philanthropy is one of them. And so, you know even if you're, So just to give you an specific example. I was working with Bloomberg Philanthropies, evaluating a bunch of different programs they might invest in. To spur investment in career and technical education. And so helping students enter mostly non-degree pathways, or help equip them the skills. The State of Delaware was looking to do something really different with how they structured career and technical education. And they were looking for funding to do it And so I went down there to understand what they were thinking. They'd ask for a few million dollars. Now, the state of Delaware, their entire budget for K12 I don't if its off the top of my head, but it's certainly hundreds and millions of dollars. But for to grant the request of $3,000,000 they brought out the governor, a senator the CEO of a major company. Like that is what the promise the few million dollars to discretionary capital could unlock. And so, if you're a funder, you have this unbelievable, you know, everyone’s gonna answer your call. And it's a tremendous power and privilege that comes with a lot of responsibility. In my mind. But, for example like you don’t have millions of dollars to give away It makes working on the philanthropy interesting. 'Cause if you can help funders channel their energy in productive ways like you really do have a good shot of changing conversations and setting agendas. Wow. You know that's insane. So then you moved on to Bloomberg and Do you do something similar over there as what you did in Chan Zuckerberg Initiative? Largely. With Chan Zuckerberg Initiative I was focused on helping them think about how they might improve housing affordability in California. And particularly in the Bay Area. And then at Bloomberg, my work was more around higher education and career education pathways. But similar kind of philanthropic advising. Which is just, it's of these things Yeah, were going back to the thread. we started before the interview. Around career, that you know sometimes you just learn that you have a skillset or that, you know, you kind of end up in a network and and then building a portfolio projects around that can be really rewarding. So for me, part of that, is just been getting to dice different philanthropies on how they spend their money and what priority projects they pursue. So what is Concourse Education? I believe you're wearing, I believe the the logo is on your sweatshirt, right? So Concourse is a non-profit that I co-founded about three years ago. That was my first take at starting and operating non-profit college program that helps particularly low-income working adults in California. And accelerated low-cost Bachelor’s Degree Wow. So, you're helping them actually achieve their dream. And how do you actually go about doing that? So, we have a, Our headline goal is to dramatically simplify the college experience for working adults who are competing for their attention with kids, with work with all the complications of life. And particularly for people who might be working more than one job, or low-wage jobs. And so, you know they don't have time to be on the phone for two hours with the financial aid officer trying to figure out what forms to file. Or you know, if they need academic help to figure out the tiny different places they might go to get it like college needs that we designed for them And so that's what we've done. We basically redesign the college experience to really serve the student population and we have done that by partnering with two accredited universities. So we're standing along 501(c)(3) non-profit. We've kind of lately abolish partnership with these universities where we essentially ride of their accreditation and their access to financial aid. to again create a better college experience for working students. Incredible. So, Eli, over all these years working with non-profits. Trying to solve really meaningful issues. I mean, these are not simple issues. So, you know it's one thing to say I hope I'm gonna do startup that you know, makes you a better runner. With a device or whatever. It's another thing to say, "Okay, I'm gonna tackle this from of low-income people trying to attain a college education while going through the different adversities that life has to offer." I'd love to sort of peek to your brain over the last few minutes that we have. What are some of your [--] over this non-profit sector about what does it take to go and really challenge these big big problems? Yeah. It's a great question. I think one is the just right size expectations. You know, non-profits, they're not gonna change the world in two years. They’re really slow build organizations. And for couple reasons. One is the problems, as you reference they're really intractable. These are hard problems to solve. Two, you're almost definitionally they sort of our non-market problems and there's market failures so your kind of your running against headwinds. And then three, in terms of what is the what is the lifeblood that keeps non-profits going? Obviously it's called Profit Capital. Even for unearned revenue non-profit like that. So, we actually earn money from our services. We still need our profit capital to grow. And philanthropies is so different from VC. So, just to give you a sense of what that looks like in practice. With VC, if you're a associate of VC you're looking for deals where it's a 10x, or 20x, or 100x. That's gonna be a great portfolio of work. If you're asking money from a philanthropy, they were a very different orientation. First of all, it's not so clear what 10x, or a100x is. Sure. But it's more in the impact for, The whole conversation is centered more around impact rather than return. It's centered more on impact and more on than more on a return. But a program officer is not necessarily incentivized to go for the riskiest proposition. Because even if it does pay off, paying off could take place over 10 to 20 years. And things that go really badly, go really badly in six to 12 months. So, just from a incentive perspective, philanthropies not incentivized to really do super risky things. At the same time, philanthropies are very reasonably. Because non-profits are not you know, most non-profits are not on a track to become self-sustaining on revenue. You know, if you're a philanthropy, you don’t wanna set up a non-profit with a $5 million annual budget in year one. And in year two, they have that cliff. Where it's like, if we don't raise $5 million, we're dead. So, non-profits, the way they work is they're constantly, we're constantly raising our next month of runway all the time. And what this means, my resourcing perspective is it's really hard to inbox them like a five or 10, or even a two-year time pricing like in a for profit company. So, I think the headline in all this is that non-profit philanthropy field is really valuable places to work. They're trade-offs. And one of the trade-offs is that And if you're really sluggy And its more of a slow burn most the time and for profits. So, do you see yourself, We talked about this idea of non-linear career pathways. Do you see yourself going back to the sort of a business sector and the for-profit sector? Or is it something that you're really passionate about that you see yourself going forever? Yeah. I'm not an ideal about any particular organization of an entity like you know, some companies are great, that's for profits and non-profits, that are great. I believe in the importance on the rule of government. And so, my hope maybe at the end of the conversation where we started I think, I learned about myself that I love having a portfolio of things I worked on. And so, I would be surprised, although not shocked if I, if I never spend 10 or 15 or 20 years on one thing in my career. It's just not exactly who I am. Or not who I've been. Although we all gonna change. One thing I like to share with people who are thinking about their own careers and create trajectories is that that's okay. Like I think for me I felt that was really not okay for awhile And I was talking to a mentor of mine And he basically asked, "Have you ever considered that this is okay? Like this is not a problem to solve?" But maybe a [--] Totally. Exactly. Well played. So, then when I was listening to this you singing about their own career, in courier design like you know, maybe look at the patterns that you've created in your early career and think critically about you de-problematize them. Is this actually a problem? And if it feels like a problem, how might I make it not a problem? And sometimes that can be I think liberating. Definitely. You know, I love it. You know, we have just about a minute and a half left. And I have so many more questions. But, I have the most important one. And I'm gonna put you on the spot. So, I apologize in advance. I'd love for you to tell me three words that would best describe yourself. That you would best describe yourself? Or that one of your co-founders would describe you or Andrew Ng would describe you as. Oh man. Okay. Probably, Curious. Earnest. Very earnest. And Neurotic. Like a good Jewish guy. Very neurotic. I love it. Does it help with business? Sometimes, it creates a lot [--] but sometimes helps I suppose. Yeah. I love it. Eli, thank you so much for the time. Thank you so much for the inspiration, I mean, this slow non-linear path that you're talking about. I think it's something that's really, it's really magnificent. And we have this really interesting talk. with Alyssa Rapp, who is a GSB Venture and I talked with her awhile back and I believe we already by the time this airs her interview would be published. And one of the most interesting things that she was talking about was her non-linear path that she got that she helped her mother to go through And today, really we have this privilege. And especially that we get to go to, these really great institutions and we get to harness all these different skillsets It's almost a waste not to go and try to put our feet it. To dive into different waters. And to test different fields. And see where we can make an impact. On various sectors. Not just one. Well put. Yeah. Toda raba. It's been a pleasure. Thanks so much and great to be here. Thank you and we'll need to catch up over a beer when I'm back in Palo Alto and this whole covid thing is over. Beautiful word of spirit. Cool. Take care. Bye bye Eli. Thank you.
