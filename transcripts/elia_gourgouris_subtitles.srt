00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,700
Dr. Elia Gourgouris,

2
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,700
thank you so much for joining me 
on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,700
Thank you for having me.

4
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,700
I appreciate it. 
It’s good to be here.

5
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,700
It’s going to be so much fun. 
I’m going to spend the next

6
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,700
20 minutes learning how to be 
happier and how to navigate

7
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,700
through crisis better 
because these are the two books

8
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,000
that you’ve written.
The first one, a best-selling

9
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,300
book; the second one, 
I’m guessing, is already

10
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,700
on its way to becoming 
a best-selling book.

11
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,700
- It's out in the market. 
- I hope so. It just came out.

12
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,700
So, I hope so.

13
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,700
- It's just looking good.
- You have it next to you.

14
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,300
So, let me see the cover.

15
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,300
Let me see how it looks.

16
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,700
The new book is 
“7 Keys to Navigating a Crisis,”

17
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,300
a practical guide to mostly 
dealing with pandemics

18
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,700
and other disasters. 
We’re going through a multitude

19
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,300
of crises at the same time 
right now.

20
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,700
- WIth four, right?
- So, this is really morbid.

21
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
Yes. Yes.

22
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,700
Okay. We’re going to 
get there in a second.

23
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,700
But first, I need to know 
how to be happier

24
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,700
and I’m very excited for this. 
So, maybe just give me a couple

25
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,700
of the key earned insights. 
Over your decades of research,

26
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,700
what is happiness and why 
do we yearn for it so much,

27
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,700
this concept?

28
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,700
First of all, 
happiness is a choice.

29
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,700
Let’s make it -- 
And it takes work, however.

30
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,700
It comes easier 
for some than others.

31
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,000
But I will tell you this. 
I get to speak internationally.

32
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,700
I travel around the world 
speaking on happiness

33
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,700
and wellness.

34
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
In every country, 
the first question

35
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,700
I ask the audience is this -- 
if you were to ask any parent,

36
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,700
regardless of nationality, 
ethnicity, religious affiliation,

37
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,700
socio-economic status, gender, 
whatever, "What would you like

38
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,700
for your children?"

39
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,000
And the answer is always, 
“I just want them to be --"

40
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,300
and then I take the microphone 
and I point towards the audience,

41
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:29,900
“Happy!” you know,

42
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,400
everybody's --

43
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,300
because that’s 
a universal need, right?

44
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,900
We are here on this earth 
to be happy.

45
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,300
So, the easiest way, 
of course, is --

46
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,700
you cannot be grateful
and be sad at the same time.

47
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,700
So, to have an attitude 
of gratitude

48
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,700
-- and that’s pretty well-known.

49
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,700
What I want to 
raise the bar a little bit --

50
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,700
because it’s easy to be grateful 
when everything is going well.

51
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,700
That’s the easiest thing 
in the world.

52
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,300
I say that we’re all graduates 
from the same university,

53
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,700
the university of adversity.

54
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,700
And the older we get, and 
the more experience we have,

55
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,700
the higher the degree.

56
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,700
So, by the time 
you get to be my age,

57
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,700
you have gray hair, 
you have multiple PhDs

58
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,700
and adversity in life.

59
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,700
Meaning, that we’re all going to 
lose people we love --

60
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,900
our grandparents first, 
and then our parents,

61
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,500
at some point, 
maybe a spouse or a sibling,

62
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,700
God forbid, a child.

63
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
We’re going to have 
financial crisis.

64
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,700
We’re going to 
have health crisis,

65
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,700
be it cancer, heart disease, 
diabetes, and so on.

66
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,700
We’re going to have 
relationships, divorces.

67
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,700
Things aren’t going to work out.

68
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,700
So, all of these things are part 
of the human existence, right?

69
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,700
So, the key, of course, now, is 
can you be grateful

70
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,700
in the midst of crisis?

71
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,700
Can you be grateful when 
you’re facing adversity in life?

72
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,000
Because when things 
are going well, like I said,

73
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,700
it’s easy to be happy 
and to be grateful.

74
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,700
But can we be grateful 
in the midst of

75
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,700
the darkness of life?

76
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,000
I’m going to ask you that. 
What do you think?

77
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,700
Is that possible even?

78
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,000
It has to be, otherwise, 
this is going to be a very

79
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
sad conversation.

80
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,700
So, I’m going to say 
that it has to be.

81
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
It has to be, yes.

82
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,300
And the key, of course, 
to that is, to me, nothing bad

83
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,000
has ever happened in my own 
personal life

84
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and the thousands of patients --

85
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I used to be a 
clinical psychologist,

86
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
my first ever practice 
in my life before I switched

87
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,700
over to the corporate side.

88
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,700
Everybody faces these things.

89
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,700
Some of them, multiple times, 
and sometimes,

90
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,700
at the same time, 
which is very difficult.

91
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,700
But to me, either you’re learning 
something or you’re winning.

92
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
There’s no losing in life --

93
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,700
Right.

94
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,700
-- if you learned the lesson.

95
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,700
So, out of the toughest, 
the most -- the darkest of times,

96
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,700
I’ve actually learned more 
than my successes.

97
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,700
Right.

98
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,700
And then, you use those 
to move forward, right? In life.

99
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,700
- So... 
- Sure.

100
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,700
...don’t be afraid 
of adversity because

101
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,700
adversity is coming. 
And we’re getting it now

102
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,700
in spades, actually, in humanity 
as we speak right now.

103
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,700
And I do want to go to that. 
We got multiple crises.

104
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,700
We got the COVID-19.

105
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,700
We have the financial crisis 
and economic crisis

106
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,700
as the result of the shutdown. 
We have a mental health crisis.

107
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,700
Just in the United States alone, 
after the first two months --

108
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,700
we don’t have the statistics yet,
from the month of May yet.

109
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,700
Depression, anxiety, 
stress-related disorders,

110
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,700
up an astonishing 700%.

111
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,700
Seven hundred percent.

112
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,700
Seven hundred percent. 
These are new people.

113
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,300
Not people that have 
pre-existing conditions,

114
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,300
mind you.

115
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,700
These are specifically 
as a result of the pandemic.

116
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,000
And then, of course, you have 
the racial strife and everything

117
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,700
that’s happening in the streets 
right now as we speak.

118
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,700
So, to have four crises 
simultaneously is very unusual.

119
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,700
Now, I’m an optimist by nature 
and I will tell you this,

120
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,000
that humanity may be down 
on one knee and maybe

121
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
struggling a little bit. 
And we’re getting

122
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,700
a beating right now.

123
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,700
But we will overcome this. 
Let there be no doubt.

124
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,700
And I also want to share with you 
that there are four types --

125
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,700
four personality types 
when dealing with crisis.

126
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:02,700
And there’s a big differentiation 
between danger and fear.

127
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,300
If somebody comes up to you 
and cuss in your face right now,

128
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,700
you’re in danger. 
That’s real.

129
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,700
Fear, however, is not your friend.

130
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,000
So, we don’t want 
to make decisions,

131
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,700
whether as individuals 
or as companies,

132
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,700
whether in the corporate world 
or any organization based on fear

133
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
because those are 
not good decisions.

134
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,200
- Right.
- So now,

135
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,700
let’s talk about 
the four personality types.

136
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,700
Number one is the victim.

137
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,700
The victim is all, 
“Why is this happening to me?

138
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,700
"This always happens to me." 
"Poor me,” right? "Poor me."

139
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,700
The second personality type 
is what we call the critic.

140
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,700
Now the critic, 
regardless of

141
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,700
what the federal state 
or local government,

142
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,700
or the health care 
officials that --

143
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,700
they criticize everything.

144
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,700
For example, “You should wear 
a mask when you go outside.”

145
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,700
“Well, that’s stupid.”

146
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,000
Okay. “Okay, don’t wear 
a mask when you go outside.”

147
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,700
“Well, that’s stupid, too.” 
Like, no matter what comes up,

148
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,700
they criticize everything, right?

149
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,700
It's like no matter --

150
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,700
It doesn’t matter what it is.

151
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,700
The third group, 
we’d like to call the bystander.

152
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,700
They make the most noise, right?

153
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,300
They do and they’re very loud.

154
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,300
They’re very loud.

155
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,700
But they offer no solutions. 
This is important.

156
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,700
The third group, 
we'd call the bystander.

157
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,700
Now, the bystander 
is a good person.

158
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,700
But basically, the bystander 
is overwhelmed by --

159
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,700
and really doesn’t 
know what to do.

160
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,700
Like, “This is a huge 
wave of unknown.

161
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,700
I feel out of control. 
My life is out of control.

162
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
I don’t know what to do.”
So, they look to their left.

163
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
They look to their right. 
They look at their neighbor.

164
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,300
But they sit in their -- 
they have that deer with

165
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,700
the headlights look, 
and they do nothing.

166
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,700
And all three of these
personality types have

167
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,700
one thing in common. 
They offer no solution.

168
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,700
Right.

169
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,700
The victim doesn’t,
the critics surely doesn’t,

170
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,700
and neither does the bystander. 
Now we get to the fourth type.

171
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,700
And the fourth type, 
we’d like to call the navigator.

172
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,700
And the navigator --

173
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,700
and this is the premise 
of this book, right?

174
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,300
That we all should 
become navigators.

175
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,300
The navigator begins 
with a positive attitude,

176
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,700
and says, “Look. 
No matter what happens,

177
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,700
we will overcome this,”

178
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,700
practices self-care, 
which is the first key

179
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,300
to navigating a crisis.

180
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,000
Meaning,

181
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,700
They take care of themselves 
in order to be successful.

182
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,700
And then, they are flexible 
and adaptable.

183
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,300
With this new normal,

184
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,700
if you think you can go on

185
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,700
and do business as usual 
and expect to have

186
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,700
successful results, 
you’re sadly mistaken.

187
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,700
Right. Right.

188
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,700
Everything’s completely 
different right now

189
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
in the last 90 days 
to four months.

190
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,700
And why is flexibility important?

191
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,700
We’d like to use the example 
of the oak tree and the palm tree.

192
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,000
The oak tree symbolically 
speaking -- think about this.

193
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,700
The oak tree is this massive, 
strong tree that’s been

194
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,700
around for 100 years.

195
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,700
- Huge, strong, right?
- Very stable. Yup.

196
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,700
But if there’s enough moisture,

197
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,700
enough rain and enough wind 
at the top of the storm,

198
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,300
the hurricane, 
guess what happens to oak trees.

199
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,700
They come crashing down,

200
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
- on cars, people, homes, and so on.
- Yeah.

201
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,700
The palm tree, 
on the other hand, is thin,

202
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,300
tall but very flexible.

203
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,300
At the top of the hurricane 
150 miles, yes, it goes of wide --
204
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
it’ll go parallel to the ground.

205
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,300
But when the storm passes --

206
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,300
and think about 
the storm of life,

207
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,300
- right? Not actual storm --
- Yeah.

208
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,300
-- it raises up again
and survives.

209
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,300
Up and down, yeah.

210
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,700
Up and down.

211
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,700
So, we’re asking people 
now to be flexible

212
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,700
like a palm tree.

213
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,000
Don't be an oak tree and say, 
“Well, that’s how I’ve done

214
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,700
things for the last 30 years. 
I’m not changing,”

215
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,700
you’re going to break 
if you stay like that.

216
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,700
You need to be flexible.

217
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,700
But Dr. Gourgouris, 
I have to ask.

218
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,700
Because you also have 
a lot of experience

219
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,700
working with corporates.

220
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,700
And you transitioned 
from clinical work

221
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,300
to the private sector.

222
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,700
And now, 
you’re helping leaders --

223
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,700
and I’m going to take 
myself for example.

224
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,700
One day, I’m going to 
have a company of my own.

225
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,700
And I hope to have 
a thousand employees,

226
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,700
which I can lead that ship
wherever we go.

227
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,700
Now, the question is, 
is it really reasonable

228
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,000
to try and aim for all 
of the employees

229
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,700
in the organization 
to be navigators?

230
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,700
Or do you want 
to have some critics,

231
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,700
some bystanders?

232
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,300
Or do you really want 
everybody to be

233
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,700
navigators here?

234
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,700
This is a fantastic question 
and here’s why.

235
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:56,000
The critic, the victim, 
the bystander. and the navigator

236
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,700
all exist within 
every human being.

237
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,700
We all have those 
personalities within us, right?

238
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,200
Yeah.

239
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,700
And I'll tell you, 
when this first hit,

240
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,700
I was the bystander. 
All my speaking engagements

241
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,700
that I had set up 
throughout the world,

242
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,700
guess what happened? Cancelled.

243
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,700
- Yeah.
- All gone.

244
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,700
I’m like, 
“Now what do I do,” right?

245
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,700
And I kind of feel like 
a victim a little bit.

246
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,700
I’m like, “Oh, no! 
Why is this happening to me?”

247
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,700
And believe me, 
there are things

248
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,700
that the government 
has done that I criticized

249
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,700
very openly. 
I’m like, “That is stupid.”

250
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,000
Look, I see people driving 
in their cars, sometimes,

251
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
by themselves wearing a mask. 
Hello! There’s nobody else

252
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,700
in the car.

253
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,700
And here is the important thing,

254
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,700
I didn’t stay a victim.

255
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,300
I didn't stay in critical mode.

256
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,700
And I didn’t stay as a bystander.

257
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,700
I decided to do 
something about it.

258
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
And the result of actually 
that of the navigating

259
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,300
is writing a brand-new book.

260
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,700
I had no plans in 2020 
to write a book.

261
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,700
Beautiful.

262
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,300
I had this impression 
that I needed to do it

263
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,700
and I called my partner. 
I’m like -- he’s Greek also.

264
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,000
I’m like, 
“Costa, do you want

265
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,700
to write a book?
I'm going to write this book.

266
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,000
Are you in 
or are you out, brother?”

267
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
- He goes, “I’m in.”
-  I love it.

268
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,300
And in 45 days, 
we got the book out.

269
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:01,800
Wow!

270
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,900
To put that in perspective,

271
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,700
my first book 
took three years to write.

272
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
Okay. That’s incredible.

273
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,700
That’s what navigation 
looks like.

274
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,000
So, do we want 
all our employees

275
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,700
to be navigators? 
You’re darn right, we do.

276
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,000
No, I think that’s incredible. 
Specifically -- just yesterday,

277
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I spoke with a professor, 
Dan Ariely, who’s a good friend

278
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,700
and a mentor, 
behavioral economics.

279
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,700
He wrote 
“Predictably Irrational."

280
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,000
And he said that 
one of the things --

281
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,300
His advice to us was that 
when he has a plane

282
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,000
that is delayed, 
he sits down

283
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,700
and uses that opportunity 
to write a children’s book.

284
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
And he only writes 
the children’s book

285
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,700
when his flight is delayed. 
So, he’s turning that situation

286
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,700
form a victim point, 
“Why is this happening to me,” to

287
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,000
“Oh! I have an opportunity 
to now work on a project

288
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,700
that I never had a chance.” 
So, I’m seeing all these patterns

289
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,700
of the very successful people 
and I’m starting to

290
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,700
adopt this mindset.

291
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,700
So, we want everybody 
to be navigators,

292
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,700
but also -- more importantly 
because of the other book, too,

293
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,700
we want them 
to be happy navigators.

294
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,700
We don’t want you 
to just navigate and --

295
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,700
- be grumpy about it.
- What does that mean?

296
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,700
What does that mean, 
being a happy navigator?

297
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,000
To me, it means that 
you enjoy the process.

298
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You truly enjoy the journey.

299
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,700
When we talk 
in the corporate world --

300
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,700
I started talking about happiness 
in the corporate world before

301
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
all the studies 
backed it up, right?

302
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,000
Because they used to be like, 
“Happy employees? I pay them.

303
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,300
What do they need to be happy for?”

304
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,000
[laughs]

305
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I’ll tell you why 
they need to be happy.

306
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,700
Because happy employees, 
number one,

307
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
they're physically healthier.

308
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,000
That means they 
have less time off

309
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,300
because they’re healthier.

310
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,900
Okay.

311
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,700
They’re more collaborative. 
They’re better team players

312
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,700
because they’re happier. 
There’s greater retention, right?

313
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,700
People don’t leave. 
They’re loyal.

314
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,700
They love where they work.

315
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,000
And as a result to that, 
they’re more productive.

316
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,700
Right.

317
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Guess what happens 
when you have a

318
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,700
productive workforce. 
Your company is more profitable.

319
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,700
Well, what’s happening now 
in Silicon Valley?

320
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,300
Every other day, 
we see of another allegation

321
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,700
or accusation of 
companies’ cultures.

322
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,000
They’re just going down. 
And it seems that company

323
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,700
culture in 2020 is 
one of the most important aspects

324
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
that a founder has to work on.

325
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,700
So, where do you come 
into this arena?

326
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,700
What's happening? 
And why are companies suffering

327
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,700
from their lack of 
happiness or culture?

328
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,700
Because their focus 
should be where?

329
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,000
When you treat 
your employees poorly,

330
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,700
guess how your employers 
treat your customers.

331
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,700
Poorly.

332
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,700
When you treat 
your employees well,

333
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,300
guess how they treat 
your customers.

334
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,700
They treat your customers well.

335
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
There’s a direct link 
between the way

336
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
that you treat people.

337
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,700
So, in the rush -- 
especially, nowadays,

338
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,000
with the economy 
being shut down

339
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,700
for 60 to 90 days,

340
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,700
HR directors right now 
are having a very difficult time

341
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,700
- Yup.
- because the CEO --

342
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,700
now, they’re ramping up 
again, economy --

343
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,700
businesses are coming 
back on again, right?

344
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,700
Now they’re like, “Listen. 
Our revenue,

345
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,700
we’re behind schedule 
by 60 to 90 days,

346
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,700
what are goals 
were for this year.”

347
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,700
The employees need to work 
two times or three times

348
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,700
as hard as they did before.

349
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,700
That’s where 
their CEO is coming from.

350
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,700
Now, the employees, 
on the other hand,

351
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,700
who are coming back --

352
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,000
and not all of them because some 
of them are going to stay at home.

353
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,700
They’re going to refuse 
to come to work.

354
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,700
They’ve been traumatized 
by all this.

355
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,300
So many things 
have happened

356
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,700
out of their control.

357
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,700
So, the seniors --

358
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,000
I call it the C-suite, basically.

359
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Senior leaders need to 
treat employees completely

360
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,700
different than before.

361
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,700
And they need to say, 
“Look, I know we have to hit

362
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,700
those numbers by the end 
of this month.

363
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
But here’s the why behind it.”

364
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,000
Like, they need to step up 
their own game and communicate

365
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
to the employees as to, "Why 
I’m asking you

366
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,700
to hit those numbers? 
Because if we don’t,

367
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,700
I may have to lay off 25% 
of the workforce.

368
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,000
And I don’t want to do that."

369
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,700
The enlightened leader 
will use those words, and say,

370
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,000
“You’re part of my family.

371
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,700
I don’t want to have 
to let go of any one of you.

372
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,700
I need you to work harder 
so we can hit those numbers,

373
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,700
so everybody is still 
employed next month."

374
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,700
And not to do it 
in a fear-based mode,

375
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,700
where you do it, 
“Or else --”

376
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,700
but truly do it in an empathetic, 
caring and compassionate mode,

377
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
so say, “Listen, 
we’re all in this together.

378
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
We’re all struggling.

379
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,700
None of us expected to have 
almost zero revenue for 90 days.

380
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,700
So, we’re way behind 
the 8th ball.

381
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,000
I do need your help. 
I do need you to work 14 hours,

382
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,700
but I’m doing this 
because I also want you to be

383
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
here at the end of the year 
so we can all be

384
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,700
standing together and united.”

385
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,700
If they don’t do that 
and they just focus

386
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,700
on the bottom line --

387
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,700
these people are already scared.

388
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,700
They’re already down. 
They’re already depressed

389
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,700
and traumatized.

390
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,000
You had that kind of pressure 
on top of that,

391
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,700
you’re not going 
to hit your goals.

392
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,300
So, it’s sounds like 
if I thought that until now

393
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,700
as the real test of leadership, 
it sounds like, actually,

394
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,700
the re-opening 
is going to be just as great

395
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,000
a test on how do you now treat -- 
how do you understand

396
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,700
and empathize 
with the new situation

397
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,700
and your "new employees" that -- 
it’s not just like

398
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,700
you froze for 90 days 
and you came back to reality.

399
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,700
But reality continued. 
It diverted.

400
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
And now, you have 
a new reality to work with.

401
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,000
And you used two key words. 
Empathy, meaning --

402
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,700
in other words, senior leaders 
need to show increased

403
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,000
emotional intelligence, 
like they need a lot more than

404
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,200
they ever have before.

405
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,700
That’s number one. 
And then number two,

406
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,700
in some ways, 
you’re re-onboarding

407
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,700
all your employees, 
like as if they’re new

408
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,000
because this is a new -- 
truly, it’s a new normal.

409
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And people say, 
“Oh, I hate to use that term.”

410
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,700
But guess what? 
The new normal

411
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,700
will become the new normal 
because these

412
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,700
are changing so rapidly, 
we really don’t know even

413
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,000
what the fall will bring.

414
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,700
Yeah.

415
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,700
Nobody can really predict. 
Will there be a second wave?

416
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,700
How bad will it be? 
Will it happen in September

417
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,000
and November 
when the flu season kicks in?

418
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,700
People don’t really know.

419
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,700
So, this is the reason why 
it’s important to take care

420
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,700
of your employees now, 
more than ever.

421
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,700
Dr. Gourgouris, 
why are you so passionate

422
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,700
about this?

423
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,700
Why go get a PhD 
on Psychology

424
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,700
and focus on happiness, 
write two books?

425
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,700
You’re the president 
of an organization that helps

426
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,000
thousands of people be happier.

427
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,700
Why? Why?

428
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,000
Because I feel like 
my purpose in life --

429
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and I’ve known this since 
I was young man, actually,

430
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,700
is to make a difference 
in this world.

431
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,700
And I feel this world 
right now is really struggling.

432
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,700
I need to up my own game.

433
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,700
Like writing this book
 in 45 days.

434
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
I had to up my own game 
and my own expectations.

435
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,700
Because normally, I’m like --
I’m not going to greet like,

436
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,700
“Oh, whatever. 
We’ll get there

437
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,700
when we get there.” 
No, there’s an urgency

438
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
to do things right 
and to do them now,

439
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,700
because people are hurting 
and they’re struggling now,

440
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,700
not next November, 
not in 2021 or 2025.

441
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,700
We need to help them now.

442
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,700
And organizations 
need that help now.

443
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,700
This comes from an optimist. 
by the way.

444
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,300
I’m not like the-sky-is-falling 
pessimistic guy,

445
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,700
but I see what’s out there.

446
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,700
And I feel. I feel deeply.

447
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,700
So, for me, yes, happiness is 
the most important thing in life.

448
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:38,700
Senior leaders need to have 
a different mindset

449
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,700
going into this.

450
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,700
It’s not business as usual.

451
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,700
Your workforce is not the same 
that it was 90 days ago.

452
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
I promise you. 
So many things have changed.

453
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,700
So, be sensitive to that. 
The words that you also used----

454
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,700
compassion, kindness, 
understanding.

455
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,300
Over-communicate to the point 
where your employees go,

456
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,700
“Boss, enough! 
That’s the tenth time you told me

457
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,700
that you care about me. I got it. 
I got to go to work now.”

458
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,700
Like, I know it’s kind of silly 
what I’m saying,

459
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,700
but you know what I mean though.

460
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,700
- Like you have to overdo it. 
- Over-communicate, yeah.

461
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,200
Yes, over-communicate and show 
them that you truly care --

462
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,300
That’s the downfall 
of a lot of leaders, right?

463
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,300
That they under-communicate 
instead of over-communicate.

464
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,300
In other words, we can't afford 
to take shortcuts

465
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,300
as a leadership right now.

466
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,300
Not this time. Not this time.

467
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,700
I’m really excited

468
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,000
for where you’re going 
with your life.

469
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'll tell you. 
I did my research on you.

470
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You’re a wonderful young man. 
And I see nothing

471
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,700
but success in front of you.

472
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,700
Thank you. 
I really appreciate it.

473
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,700
One of the reasons why 
I enjoy this so much,

474
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,700
like we spoke before, 
it’s because I get to learn

475
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,700
of all these different industries.

476
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,700
And when else 
would I get to speak

477
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,700
to a happiness expert and gain -- 
even if I take

478
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,700
three takeaways from this

479
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,000
on over-communication 
and having empathy

480
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,300
for my colleagues 
and employees, and employers,

481
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,700
and being a navigator 
instead of a critic

482
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
or instead of a bystander.

483
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,700
I mean just those three things 
are priceless lessons

484
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,700
that I learned, 
and hopefully, my friends

485
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,700
who are watching 
this will also enjoy.

486
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,700
Doctor, before we leave --

487
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,000
and I can't believe 20 minutes are 
almost up, it's so disheartening.

488
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Going by fast.

489
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,700
- Yeah, it goes fast.
- So fast.

490
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,900
I want to know three words 
that best describe you.

491
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,000
Well, happiness is number one.

492
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,300
I mean, my nickname is, 
"You’re the 'Happiness Doctor,'”

493
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,000
basically.

494
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,700
So, happiness is one.

495
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,700
I think there’s nothing more 
important to me than family

496
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,700
and the family unit, 
the people that I love the most.

497
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,700
And then, my faith. 
Whether your faith is in God

498
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,500
or your faith is in the divine, 
or your faith is whatever

499
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,700
you want to describe that --

500
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,700
We will overcome this. 
Let there be no doubt.

501
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,000
The vaccine will come.

502
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,700
The drugs, 
we’re getting very close

503
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,300
to having the drugs already.
And I love the fact that

504
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,700
humanity is
working together.

505
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,300
All the scientists 
from all over the world are

506
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,300
working together.
We have a common enemy,

507
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,700
an invisible enemy.

508
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,300
And listen, humanity has been 
up against the wall before.

509
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,700
This is not going to be 
the end of us.

510
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,700
We will be better 
as a result of it.

511
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,700
I hope so.

512
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,700
And even in the corporate world, 
I think that’ll be better.

513
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,700
The working from home, 
or some of the differences

514
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,700
that we're seeing right now,

515
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,300
in new ways, there’ll be 
more innovation than we’ve seen

516
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,300
in quite a while 
because that’s what crisis

517
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,700
brings about, 
is the need for innovation.

518
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,000
So, that’s another plus.
So, don’t give up.

519
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,700
I love it.

520
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,700
Keep the faith. Be happy.

521
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,300
I love it. 
Okay, last question

522
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,700
just because it’s really 
fascinating me now.

523
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,700
Where are we headed with
the research on happiness?

524
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,700
What is left to uncover?

525
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,700
So, we know we want to be happy.

526
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,700
We have an idea of things that --

527
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,700
of how to deal with adversity.

528
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,700
But what is left to uncover 
on this big question of happiness?

529
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,700
I think the one thing that

530
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,700
all of the happiness, it has to do 
with kindness,

531
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,700
because,

532
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,300
yes, self-care is important.

533
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,300
But it's --

534
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,700
in the end, why?

535
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,300
Why are we doing all this? 
It’s to help one another.

536
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,700
I want talk to your audience.

537
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,000
If you’re feeling 
sorry for yourself,

538
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,700
if you feel like, 
“Man, I have to sort out --

539
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,700
Things are really hard 
right now,”

540
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,700
I promise you 
there’s somebody else

541
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,700
out there whose life 
is a lot worse than yours.

542
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,700
A hundred percent.

543
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,700
Find that person and, 
in act of service.

544
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,700
It could be a text. 
It could be a phone call.

545
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,700
If you get that prompting, 
“I need to call Michael,”

546
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,700
I’m not going to put it off. 
I’m going to call Michael,

547
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
say, “How are you doing?”

548
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,700
In America, here, 
the answer is always,

549
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,000
“I’m doing fine.” 
And I’m going to say,

550
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
“No, no, no. 
How are you really doing?

551
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,700
It’s between you and I now.”

552
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,300
This is what managers 
need to do with their employees.

553
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:28,800
Yes.

554
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,300
They need to ask 
the second question,

555
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,300
not just a token, 
“How are you doing,”

556
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,700
because most people 
are going to say, “Fine.”

557
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,300
I’m like, 
“No, let me close the door. "

558
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,300
"I see your countenance. 
I see your face."

559
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,300
"I see your eyes. 
I think you’re struggling."

560
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,300
"Tell me what I can do 
to help you.”

561
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,300
I think this is the Greek 
part of you that’s

562
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,300
coming out from the --

563
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,300
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

564
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,300
Yes. It is because we love --

565
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,300
There’s a work in Greek 
called “philoxenia,"

566
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:52,900
which means --

567
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,900
Philoxenia means 
"the love of strangers,"

568
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,900
in essence.

569
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:01,300
So, we have to go the extra mile 
and help those around us.

570
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,700
And there’s need all around.

571
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,700
By the way, happy people 
are kind by nature.

572
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,700
On the other hand,

573
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,000
when you perform 
an act of kindness,

574
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,700
that makes you happy 
on the inside.

575
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,700
So, with kindness and happiness,

576
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,700
you can’t have one 
without the other, in essence.

577
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,700
Maybe there need to be 
more study about

578
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,700
connection between those two,
kindness and happiness.

579
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,700
I love it.

580
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,700
Dr. Gourgouris, thank you 
so much for your time,

581
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,700
for the inspiration. 
I can’t wait to order your book

582
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,700
and read it, “Navigating Crisis." 
I can’t believe

583
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,700
you wrote it in 45 days. 
That must be [inaudible]  --

584
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,700
I had help. I had help.

585
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,700
Of course. 
With all the help in the world,

586
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,700
bringing an idea to production 
in 45 days, it’s mind-blowing.

587
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,700
So, I can’t wait to read it.

588
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,700
And thank you 
for taking the time to do this.

589
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,700
Thanks for having me 
on your program.

590
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,700
Thank you.

591
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,300
Take care.

592
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,700
You, too.
