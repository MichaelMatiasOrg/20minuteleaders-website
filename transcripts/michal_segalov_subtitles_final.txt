Michal Segalov, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Thanks for having me. So great to have you. Software Engineering Director at Google. Co-founder of the amazing program Mind The Gap. But I don't wanna talk about Google. I don't wanna talk about what's happening today. I wanna go back. I wanna hear your story because it's such an incredible inspiration for me when I first heard it a few months ago when we had coffee back when you were allowed to have coffee with another person in the same room and not over Zoom. Michal, take me away to your childhood. How do you enter the engineering world? So I think the story of how I got into engineering and computer science is kind of a story of lucky or unlucky coincidences depending on how you look at it. And it's all been kind of happening by chance. So, growing up, I was always exposed to computers in the sense that I had two older brothers and they were very much into computer science. But my exposure was, I would say, almost negative. I was very adamant and very convinced on one thing: that there is absolutely no way that I would go into computer science. I looked at it as this geeky, and programming in general right, I looked at it as this geeky thing that my older brothers are doing and there was no way that someone as cool as me at the time would ever be interested in. And I think that it was something that I was very, it was very much a part of how I thought about it. In fact, there is even stories that run in my family about that time where everyone tried to teach me how to program. And there was really a family effort where my brothers and my parents all kind of gave it their own shot and at different times reached pretty much the same conclusion that computer science and programming is just not for me. And is that just because you're not enjoying it? You're not willing to try it out? Why did you reach that conclusion? Or why did everybody else reach that conclusion? So, I actually interviewed them not too long ago and asked them about it. And I think that they, of course, retroactively, they all gave slightly different things than I think what they thought at the time. But it was a mix of what they perceived as lack of interest and, at best, and maybe lack of skill if you look at some of how they perceived our interactions around computer science and programming at the time. So, I think that from my perspective, and I think I kind of suppressed that whole experience because I didn't remember it as well as they all did. But I think kind of reflecting back, I just didn't think of it as something that would make sense for me to do and I didn't really understand what programming is and what programming essentially enables in my life and in general. So, I kind of took it for what it was, which was okay you type things in the computer and then it spits out numbers at you or does something at you. And I didn't quite make that connection. And I think the other component is that I didn't even perceive myself as the type of person that could potentially do this, right. The only people who I knew that were programming at the time were basically my two older brothers or my two geeky older brothers. Right? Right. It wasn't something that I felt very connected to. And what ultimately did clearly change things for me, because obviously things have changed, was actually the military. So, I was born and raised in Israel and of course, when you're 18 there's a mandatory military service. And one thing that the militarism does very well is utilize all of its possible resources. And basically, they ran me through a series of tests at the end of which they decided that computer programming is something that I can potentially be quite good at. So, different from your brothers and your parents, they don't ask you and come up with a conclusion. ... they tell you, "Michal, for the next three years, you're gonna be a computer programmer." Exactly. I even remember that they asked me. There was an in-person interview. They asked me, "Would you be interested in that?" And I said, "No." For me, the military takes your input into consideration but ultimately that's what's best for the military. Right. And that's kind of how I, I guess, discovered this. So, you become a software engineer. Fast forward a few years and you're already you're a very, very successful software engineer within Google. A director within Google. But looking back in retrospective, So obviously you love what you're doing. I mean, you're a geek. We can say now, proudly. I am. I'm proud of it. But Michal, going back to your childhood, that was something that you weren't really willing to accept. And I think that I actually can relate very very well to what you're saying. The first lines of code that I really wrote were in the military. And even though I come from a very techie, and geeky household I was never really into computer programming. Now, I love programming both at Stanford and at Hippo where I work and also in the IDF. Why do you think that you weren't interested in computer science? Or why weren't you open to exploring it back when you were a kid? So I think the thing that my story, when I reflect back, when I think of it, is that success and being successful at something is very situational. Right. And it's something that as a leader is important for me to remember. It's not that someone is not good at something. Right? Oftentimes, if that someone hasn't been exposed to something in the right way, that just makes things click. Or sometimes it's that someone, that people don't perceive themselves as being able to excel at something. And I think that in my case, it was probably a combination where I both didn't perceived myself as someone who could do this line of work. But also I think it just it might not have been the right time or the right way to introduce me into computer science. And I was actually quite shocked because when I talked to my brother, who probably was the one who was able to persevere along with his attempts to try and teach me very basic computer science concepts, the things that he said that I didn't grasp at the time are things that are quite trivial, right. So I think it was more of a matter of me being open to it and also, how it was taught. And somehow when I was 18 and in the military, something just clicked. And from there on it just kind of flowed. I mean it resonates a lot with a very interesting conversation I had with another leader the other day where they were talking about how, when you're managing somebody and they're not living up to their potential by keeping them on the team and by not giving them concrete feedback or sometimes firing them when you need to, you're actually doing a disservice to them because you're not allowing them to live up to the potential. And maybe it's situational that in the current place where they're at, they're not able to do that. Maybe they do have the skills, but they're just not able to explore them and to bring them to fruition. But Michal, you're taking your own experience and then you did something really amazing with it. And you helped create an organization called Mind the Gap. So, tell me a little bit about what that is and how that helped inspire other girls to go into tech? So, Mind The Gap is a program that I started with Daniela Reichman, who's also an engineering manager at Google and is a close friend of mine. We started it, I think it was in 2009 so quote some time ago, with a goal of exposing young girls to computer science and ... And I think we took a pretty, I would say, self centered point of view on things. And we both had quite similar stories of how we got into programming and of being resistant to it at that critical age. And we basically wanted to create something that would cater to our younger selves and try to expose our younger selves to computer science programming and show us what we see in it today. Right. What is the younger self? So, what age are we talking about which is really the critical age that you've understood is where you should inject yourself in? So, it's around junior high school. The reason we chose that age is because if you look at the funnel of when girls and minorities drop out of I would say the path towards computer science, that's around the time that it happens. In Israel it seems particularly pronounced because all the AP classes, the selection of what you do your APs in basically happens at that time. Right. Because so in Israel, differently than in a lot of other places, especially the US, you actually choose a profession back already in high school or you choose what is your specialization. And Israel is very well known with that. Right? That very early on, you have to sort of choose what is your path. And oftentimes after the army and after you usually go to India or South America, you rediscover your roots and what you wanna do. Okay. So interesting. So, you go in and what do you actually do with these young women and what impact does this have? So, we basically try to think of what are the main causes that create this drop. And I think much like the story that I told about myself, it's a mix of things. So, one is many of them just don't understand what computer science is. It seems as, there's like code thing where you do something at the computer all by yourself and something happens and it doesn't really relate to our day to day lives. It's perceived as a profession that is very solitary where you don't actually work with ... people and you don't have to leverage any people skills that you might have. And finally, there aren't enough, unfortunately, role models. So, even if you know what computer science is, you don't not necessarily think of yourself as someone who could go in that path just because you don't see yourself in the people who are successful. So, it's almost like a chicken and the egg problem because, yeah. Self-explanatory. Yeah. So, we basically started office visits at the Google office where initially, they were on a monthly basis, later on a weekly basis, where we would bring in a group of girls. And we would give them a lecture, a technical talk about computer science. And the way that we tailored it is very much explaining how computer science touches our day to day lives. Right? Computer science is everywhere. It's in our phones. It's in our cars. It's all around us. So, creating that connection and making them see the impact that they could have on people's lives via computer science is one very important thing. Then we also had a panel where we brought in different types of disciplines under computer science. The computer science or engineering umbrella. There's product management, software engineering. There is UX, user experience, research, and many many other things just to show the diversity of skills that one might need or might be able to leverage when going down that path. Now Michal, I have to say that I relate so much to what you're saying because just like this, I was under the same impression going through high school and I took AP Computer Science. I knew Java I knew whatever, but I still thought that, yes, it's just about writing code. There is no relationship to the real life. And honestly, it's also because the curriculum in school it's in a cube. You don't really understand the connection to computers outside. You learn the algorithms and you learn the math, but you don't learn how it impacts you. Now, you mean in 2020, literally, almost everything in the room here has an operating system. Everything has a brain. And I consider myself a product guy. I consider myself as someone who loves people. I love user experience. But because I have this knowledge of computer science, I'm able to actually think about what products I could potentially build. And I'm so thankful that I got, that the Army pushed me to learning this. And that's why I can relate so well to what you're saying because as a high schooler and in middle school, it's so hard to understand this. It's, so basically the way I think of programming, it's a tool that gives you this magical ability to build the things that could change people's lives. And this is what Mind the Gap is about. Showing that to younger girls. And the program has been going on for 10 years, just over 10 years now. There's about five thousand girls a year that go through it. Five thousand girls a year? Oh, my. Yeah. Wow. That's incredible. Yeah. So, it's basically, I hope, the next generations of women computer scientists will go through it. And it keeps evolving it keeps changing based on feedback that we get and things that we see are working and are not working. And I should say that Daniela and I are no longer actively running the program. There's basically a new generation of amazing leaders that are doing this wonderful, wonderful work. And I think that's a part of what I quite like about it. The fact that it's not built around Daniela or around me. It's built around the actual content. And I think that's a huge vote of confidence that you have this inspiration for others to continue with it. And five thousand girls a year, that's just incredible. Okay. And, you know, before we started this we were talking a little bit about a personal board of directors. I think that's a fascinating term. I can't wait to hear what it means. So, when I reflect on my career and things that have helped me most. The thing that I think is most pronounced in my career is what I call this "personal board of directors" Right So, it's a set of people who are my mentors. And much like a board of directors we meet regularly. I take their advice, or I listen to their advice right ultimately, it's up to me. We're all vested together in this thing called each other's success, right It's very much a mutual relationship. And I think that it helps me a lot because oftentimes just hearing someone else's perspective on things is quite valuable. And these people, a lot of them have been with me for a decade now now or even more, right. So, they know me, sometimes, even maybe better than I know myself. Right. So, having them say certain things is something that more often than you'd expect, actually, makes me change my mind or see things differently. Amazing. And I think it started actually when the group of women that were doing Mind the Gap, initially where we would meet for Mind The Gap reasons or whatnot and overtime basically we built this community ... I'm a mother of two very cute kids. Yeah, we can cut that out if we need to. You know, it's very cute. So maybe I'll start with the board of directors question again? So, most people when they think of board of directors, they think of people who come in and they have power over your organization or over your work. They have, your voting a lot. You have to please them. What it sounds to me is that you formed these group of mentors that you deeply respect and they respect you and they're not voting on anything and you're not trying to please them, but they are people who are following your journey. And when you say that they're invested in this, it means that they've invested in the relationship. Right? They believe you. And they love working with you or they love helping you achieve your potential. Yeah. It's basically that. And oftentimes the people who I've worked with in the past - No problem. So, yeah, it is very much that it's people who oftentimes have either worked with or have met professionally otherwise. And there's always something that I deeply respect and want to learn from them. Right. And we tried to, I would hope that it's also mutual and there's something that some of them would want to learn from me. But it's definitely focused about the thing that I admire about this person, the thing I wanna get their opinion on. I love it. Michael, I wanna go up 30,000 feet in the air and I wanna look as an overview of what's happening today in the space. We can go on things like Mind the Gap or we can talk about different experiences you have. But what are some of the biggest challenges you think that we're facing now in the industry with computer science, whether that's on the education perspective or the personal fulfillment perspective. Because now you're a leader, you're managing quite a few people within a large organization like Google. You've gone through this whole experience yourself with mentors. And I'd love to pick your brain over the next few minutes. What are the biggest challenges and what can I take with me as a young engineer, as a young entrepreneur, and keeping in mind for the future? So, first I think that focus is one of the things that pretty much reshape and got a lot of leaders, myself included, to rethink things that ... The ability to talk to your peers face to face or to meet people and how to create this. It's effectively a new leadership style where you find yourselves talking to a computer, to a camera and you might not even see all the people that you're talking to. So, it's very different than what we're used to and how to adjust running an organization where people have lives people have kids. And where do you create that boundary? Where we work and live in the same place right now. So, when is work? When is life? How do you mix the two? So I think that is definitely something that I don't have a good answer on just yet, but it's definitely something that I'm thinking of. And how should I adapt my leadership style. I mean it sounds like something almost every manager in the world now has to adapt to because nobody really experienced this before. This magnitude of lack of work life balance, when the sofa is both work and your sofa And different people, of course, are impacted differently. If you think of parents, they're probably a population that has a much more difficult time and their challenges are quite different than maybe someone who lives on their own and maybe even social distancing is more difficult than that person. So, I think each person has very different needs. And it's important for leaders and organizations to think of that, take that into consideration and not necessarily expect, it's not a mold that you can apply, or that every person can apply. Michal, what are you most excited about in computer science? In the industry? The field that I work on, which is natural language understanding and I view as something that I am personally very excited about. I think that it's an area that's been evolving very rapidly. If you think like ... and basically you see these abilities that maybe years ago seemed like science fiction or something that, think of the Turing test as an example, right? I think you are supposed to recognize whether or not a person is speaking to you or a computer Right. And I think that the advancements that were made are quite impressive state-of-the-art advancements, and I think that now we're starting to see those basically being built at scale by a lot of the larger companies, like Google being one of them. So that's an area that I think will keep evolving. And I think that we will see more applications on products of the technology that we know is there. And I think that the challenge there is two-fold. So, one is finding the right set of products and how to leverage that in a way that's engaging on the one hand and doesn't have the creepy element let's say on the other hand. Right? And on the other hand, I think a very big technical challenge of how to apply these algorithms at scale. When you think of the scale that a product like Google and some of the others ones need it. So for me, I think that applies for a very wide set of challenges. I think it's fascinating that you get to build products and work on technologies that at the end they impact immediately. Hundreds of millions of customers. It's something that I think any engineer can only dream of getting to really having a production code run and impact the lives of so many people. And I think that's probably the most incredible motivation you can have for building great products because I know that a lot of people are passionate for algorithms for the sake of algorithms. You know, I know about myself. I'm passionate about impact and how to use technologies and deep technologies to impact the lives of people. I think what you're doing there is just incredible. Michal, before we leave, I have to put you on the spot one last time. And I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. Three words. Wow. Engineer. The hardest question. but already know the answer. Okay, engineer. Persistent. Mother. Engineer, persistent, mother. It sounds like - Not necessarily in that order I love it. Michal, thank you very much. Toda raba and best of luck through these difficult times. Thank you. It was great. Thanks for having me. Take care. Bye bye. Bye.
