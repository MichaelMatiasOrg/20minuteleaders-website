 1
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,966
Liran Yaacobi, thank you so much for being with me on 20 Minute Leaders.

2
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:15,066
I'm so happy to have you here.

3
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:18,666
Thank you so much. I'm really excited. I'm really honored.

4
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,332
When did we do Mamma Mia together?

5
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,832
That was seven years ago. Nine years ago.

6
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:27,999
How much? Nine years ago.

7
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,666
That was nine years ago. Okay.

8
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:32,232
So Mamma Mia. Then we did Legally Blonde.

9
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:33,432
We did You Can't Take It With you.

10
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:36,032
You've done dozen other productions.

11
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:38,666
But those are the ones that we did together.

12
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:42,999
I had the time of my life under your command as the Director.

13
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,466
And I'm so happy to have you here.

14
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:47,766
Because I'd love to spend the next 19 minutes or so

15
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:50,666
talking about theater. Talking about education.

16
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:54,032
And how does this all fit in?

17
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,866
And what's it’s like being a drama teacher?

18
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:00,699
Educating you know, all ages eight to 12.

19
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,099
So, talk to me a little bit about what do you do?

20
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,932
Okay. I'll start from the beginning.

21
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:14,566
I'm going to start. Next year will be my 10th year at the America International School in Israel.

22
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:18,666
I'm celebrating a decade which feels like it flew by, you know.

23
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:25,199
And it started with me teaching at the middle school and high school.

24
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,932
Teaching them drama and directing a play for school a year.

25
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:32,632
So, one play in the middle school and one in the high school.

26
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:34,999
Mamma Mia, Legally Blonde. Yup.

27
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,966
That was my first play. That was my first musical and

28
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:43,666
it's just uh-- I look back and it's just fantastic.

29
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:47,899
You ran. We were rock stars. We were a hit.

30
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,199
You were a hit. And it was amazing.

31
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,866
And I think that it's set a tone for what theater is expected

32
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:59,332
and it should be like our school ever since.

33
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:03,632
And I do my best to bring it out there every single year

34
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:08,432
and usually we do but it was such an amazing experience, you know.

35
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,899
So, right next to your head over here I'm gonna put now

36
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,399
a small thing from Mamma Mia,

37
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:19,732
and of course I'm gonna put Pepper and Tanya dancing.

38
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:26,399
And then as the years pass, I started teaching in the kindergarten.

39
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,199
And then I added pre-school.

40
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,066
And then I started working with the elementary school as well.

41
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:36,199
And it ends up that I'm teaching from pre-school three-year olds

42
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,066
up to 18-year olds.

43
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:41,366
What is teaching drama? How do you teach drama?

44
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:42,932
What does that mean?

45
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:49,866
Okay. I'll start from I studied acting. Okay.

46
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:56,332
I went to acting school and I learned to be a professional actor.

47
00:10:56,333 --> 00:11:00,866
And, but drama is not acting.

48
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:04,899
So, what you do when you become a drama teacher

49
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,599
is try to teach drama as a language.

50
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,232
Okay. It's a means of communication.

51
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:11,899
And that's my motto.

52
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,799
And that's the first thing any class would hear from me

53
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,966
the very very start of a course.

54
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:21,632
And say to them, "You know, we're not gonna become the next Meryl Streep in our class.

55
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:24,466
We're going to be learning a language

56
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:28,232
in which we can express ourselves in a different way.

57
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:30,432
We're to communicate with one another

58
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:34,299
a platform in which we can express our feelings, emotions,

59
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,732
in a way that is artistic and creative

60
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:41,032
And I think that the,

61
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,799
you know the main focus is that I think about when I'm teaching drama

62
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,299
that it's a means of communication and it's creative.

63
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,366
It's a creative outlet in an era of technology.

64
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:54,666
In an era of screens and,

65
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:57,166
Talk to me about this. Because you know, when I went to AIS

66
00:11:57,167 --> 00:12:00,599
I had half of my classes, I have my laptop open.

67
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,166
In some classes, I was a rebel if I had my laptop open

68
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:08,599
because some teachers don't wanted us to have notebook.

69
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,332
I don't think teachers anymore are have that dilemma.

70
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,932
I think that it's pretty much a lost battle by now.

71
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:20,532
But I think that I was very fortunate to be in a transition age

72
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,632
where I experienced both the physical learning,

73
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:26,566
in-group experiences. Communication in the class.

74
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:28,732
And not just one-on-one with computers.

75
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:31,299
Now I believe every first grade or almost

76
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,766
has a computer that their working with.

77
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:35,299
And then they come to Liran's drama class,

78
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,099
and their computers are aside.

79
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,932
Why is this importance to have this outlet

80
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:43,166
of human to human communication for you?

81
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:47,932
So first of all, they're not allowed to bring a computer to my class.

82
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,399
It's the first thing that I tell them like,

83
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,632
"You are not, I don't want you to use a computer."

84
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:54,032
For what they will use it for?

85
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:57,799
First of all, you know, there are drama teachers

86
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,399
that will ask of it, ask you to journal.

87
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,432
To write a journal about the work, or write a blog.

88
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:08,799
like creative development and stuff like that. Right.

89
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,799
It's really important for the thought process to write things down

90
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,099
because you will forget if you don't.

91
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:20,099
But then, if I do ask them to do that, I will ask them to write in a notebook.

92
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,066
But I do ask them to use a computer if they’re looking for music

93
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:26,866
or searching for a certain scene that we're getting some inspiration.

94
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:30,066
But as a preset, we don't come in with a computer to class.

95
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:34,266
Again, in this decade that I've been working, you're right.

96
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:38,766
I think that you were a transition age in which you guys had the privilege

97
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:45,466
of doing old school learning with a pen and a paper.

98
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:52,666
But I think today, 90% of classes will be with the use of a laptop.

99
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:54,466
Sure.

100
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:58,566
Which creates a kind of disconnect.

101
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:01,466
You know, there's a little bit of an alien in like

102
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:05,666
Again, if you are a people person, then it doesn’t matter to you.

103
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:08,832
You have a hundred screens around you, you are able to communicate. Right?

104
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:12,932
Do you see a difference in generations as years go by?

105
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:14,532
Yes. Yes, a lot.

106
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:16,532
Really. Yeah.

107
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:18,466
I feel like--

108
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:20,299
First of all, it makes me feel older because,

109
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,132
it makes me feel so old because I feel like you know,

110
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:25,966
I see these generations passing by and kids changing.

111
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:30,032
And you're not comprehending like how kids are evolving.

112
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:34,532
At the end of the day I'm a 90's high schooler.

113
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:36,299
You know, like I was in high school in the 90's

114
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,799
We didn't have computers.

115
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,899
We didn't have all these things

116
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,299
So, looking back it looks so completely different.

117
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:49,366
So, this creative outlet, I think kids are very creative.

118
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:52,699
I don’t think you can take creativity out of a child.

119
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,299
That’s in their DNA.

120
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:00,132
But, they take it out with themselves on their screen.

121
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:03,966
And to shut down a screen and to force a kid to look into each other’s eyes,

122
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:06,866
is one of the most awkward things.

123
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:08,966
Yeah. Yeah.

124
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:10,299
So awkward.

125
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,699
And I mean, I don’t know if you remember

126
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,766
Still awkward for me today. So, obviously as a kid,

127
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:18,966
But it is. Obviously. It's already awkward because you're a teenager.

128
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:23,799
I don't know if you remember, when Paulina sang The Winner Takes It All,

129
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,266
and she actually sing looking into Maor's eyes,

130
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:32,566
and, Amit not Maor.

131
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:34,266
Amit. Maor is the brother. Yeah.

132
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:38,299
And it was the hardest rehearsal, ever.

133
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,132
It's a four-minute song, and there's no one on stage,

134
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:45,499
And there's a spotlight on you and all you're doing is looking at that person.

135
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,866
So, it was awkward but it's important to learn the skill.

136
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:53,399
I learned so much about humans, and interactions, and relationships

137
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,366
between people through our plays.

138
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:57,532
And I have to transition that.

139
00:15:57,533 --> 00:16:02,299
Because that is the most fascinating thing that I can ask you about.

140
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,599
The community and the family that you're building,

141
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,032
through these productions.

142
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,832
So, you're doing a high school production,

143
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,232
a middle school production,

144
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:13,032
and taking a group of you know, 10 to 20 students

145
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:14,432
who have a lot of other stuff going on.

146
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:17,766
They're not professional actors or actresses, or dancers or singers.

147
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:21,566
They are happy-go-lucky kids.

148
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:23,732
Some of them more nerdy. Some of them more athletic.

149
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,132
And you're putting them, and you're saying,

150
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:28,566
"Within a few months, we're gonna be putting up this amazing production."

151
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,532
Walk me through this process.

152
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:34,332
What happens from the audition to the end result?

153
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:38,932
Well I think that one of the magic of theater,

154
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:44,366
If we take out the classes, and we learn the communication and speak drama,

155
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:48,366
the productions is you know, I always tell the kids,

156
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:54,666
"Try to visualize the fact that you're taking black little letters on a white piece of paper.

157
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:57,132
And you're giving it life.

158
00:16:57,133 --> 00:17:01,566
Okay. After two months there won't be a piece of paper with writing on it.

159
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:04,499
You have built life."

160
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,066
And for me, that's theater.

161
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:09,532
You know the expression of life.

162
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:13,532
You bring, you express relationships.

163
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,632
Like you said, you express what emotions are.

164
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:19,632
You express what people are thinking.

165
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:23,932
You embody a human being.

166
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:27,666
And, I think that's the process that they're going through.

167
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:32,166
I am not a director that I don't really care so much

168
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:35,566
about the position in which someone is standing on stage.

169
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:38,066
What angle they're standing at.

170
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:41,566
But what do you mean to say. What do you want from your partner?

171
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:43,599
You know, when you're saying to someone, "I love you."

172
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,032
What are you actually saying to them.

173
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:47,299
What's your subtext.

174
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,066
Are you saying, "I need you Don Amigo. I am vulnerable without you."

175
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:56,632
Are you saying, " I hate you but I need you to be here to hear me."

176
00:17:56,633 --> 00:18:01,566
Or what is it that you want from your partner. Okay?

177
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:06,199
So, I'm thinking about how acting is reacting to one another.

178
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,499
So, if I say, "How are you Michael?"

179
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,266
I don't randomly throw it out there.

180
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:12,499
There's an expectation to hear an answer.

181
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,032
So if I poke you in the eye, I expect you to shut your eye. Right?

182
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:19,466
'Cause that acting is reacting and that what's acting is.

183
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:23,566
And you layer it out, you know step by step process.

184
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:27,899
And I think that once the kids understand that that's what you are doing,

185
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,999
that's when the magic comes.

186
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,532
‘Cause you can dress your character up.

187
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:33,766
And you can say, "Okay, my character is a unicorn.

188
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:35,866
And I'm gonna put a little horn over here."

189
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:42,166
But it doesn't mean anything if it doesn't have

190
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:46,699
the inside is not filled up with wants, and needs, and conflicts,

191
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,732
and obstacles, and dreams you know.

192
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:52,532
And you're trying to imagine the life of that person.

193
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,532
The keyword that I'm hearing here is awareness.

194
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,132
Because I remember for me,

195
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:58,132
spending those rehearsals and being on stage,

196
00:18:58,133 --> 00:19:02,066
you have to be so aware of yourself, your surrounding

197
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:03,432
the different things that are happening.

198
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,766
The different changes that could take place

199
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:08,032
during the show and having to adapt to them

200
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:09,566
So, one of the things that I thought about

201
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:13,199
is going into you know, acting or being on the stage is,

202
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,966
Yeah, okay so you memorize, you rehearse a hundred different times.

203
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:19,499
Liran, you caught me and might scream at you a 99 of those times

204
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,899
until you get it right that 100th time.

205
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,799
Not what to do but how to express yourself.

206
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,966
And then you just do it, and it's automatic.

207
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:30,332
But, what we don’t notice in the five runs of Mamma Mia,

208
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,766
or Legally Blonde, or Can't Take It With You,

209
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:33,599
Every time is different.

210
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,932
The audience is different.

211
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:38,532
The people are bringing in their own life unto the stage

212
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:40,966
And I think one of the beautiful things

213
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:44,599
of having experienced a non-professional production

214
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,699
was that it was very hard at least for me

215
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,466
and from some of my friends to distinguish our personal life

216
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:53,532
from the character in the show that we're doing.

217
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:55,466
And I remember especially during Legally Blonde,

218
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:58,066
there was a lot of drama. Like high school drama going around.

219
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:02,532
And you saw how every show had a different feeling.

220
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:05,899
Had a different communications style on and off the stage.

221
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,266
And it made me much more aware of people and emotions.

222
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:12,166
And I think it also tell me more empathy.

223
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:15,432
So, I think that I got so much more than just

224
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:19,232
you know, taking black words and putting them on the stage.

225
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:21,532
It meant a lot to me.

226
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:25,232
So first of all, it makes me very emotional and excited

227
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:29,599
to hear that you've been nines, eights, seven years after

228
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,966
you've done this production, you still carry this experience with you.

229
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:36,199
And yes, absolutely agree with you.

230
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:43,666
That giving life to a character is a complete exercise on empathy.

231
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:47,066
And yes, theater is live. It's alive.

232
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:50,666
And this is what people say, you know they say,

233
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,599
After seeing a Broadway show,

234
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,999
"How can these people be doing this 700 times?"

235
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,132
It changes even if its miniscule.

236
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:02,499
In US, an audience member will not see the difference.

237
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,932
It's the way you come you know.

238
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:06,066
You might have won the lottery that morning,

239
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:08,199
or your pet might have died

240
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,932
And you're still bringing in this character but there's a different.

241
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:15,966
You may sing a happy song but there's a different depths to it you know.

242
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:18,699
And it's live and it's on you.

243
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,366
And you're reacting to an audience.

244
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:25,366
You know there are performances in which the audience,

245
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,466
and especially in a school, when you have, it's an international school

246
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:33,132
you might have the parents come and that 90% of them don't speak English

247
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:37,032
as a first language, and they're not laughing at the jokes.

248
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:40,066
That you thought are, "Oh my God, they're so obvious out there."

249
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:45,999
So, you deal with that as an actor.

250
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,566
You're having not only a relationship with your co-actor,

251
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:52,066
but also a relationship with the audience member.

252
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:58,732
Or how like a burst of laughter will immediately ignite this energy

253
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:02,532
boost of energy for the rest of the performance.

254
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:07,499
And, I think also that that's the magic of performance.

255
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,832
You know, and for me being able to teach kids,

256
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,232
and having them experienced that

257
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:18,532
is worth everything everything everything you know.

258
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:19,499
And that was my next question.

259
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,332
Because you know with your experience,

260
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,832
there's so many opportunities, of places where you can be

261
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:28,799
and things that you could do in the drama and theater world.

262
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,532
You choose to be an educator and spend much of your time

263
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:34,666
working with kids who've never sang and dance

264
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:39,766
spoken on stage, helping overcome public speaking fears,

265
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:44,232
helping overcome social anxiety and teaching them empathy

266
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:48,266
in circumstances that they might not have otherwise.

267
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:51,066
It sounds great but it's very hard work.

268
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:52,999
Why do you choose to do that hard work

269
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,432
instead of going and having fun and have [--] or any other theater?

270
00:22:57,433 --> 00:23:05,632
Well, first of all to be fair, the professional acting world isn’t easy.

271
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:08,666
Like anything that is professional you know,

272
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:14,766
like I assume startups looks like fun but it's also a lot of work.

273
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:16,232
99% fail. Yeah.

274
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:20,499
Yeah. And you'll hear many Nos next to this wonderful Yesses.

275
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,532
that you might hear in the news. Sure.

276
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:25,966
But, I think that for me, the transition from

277
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:30,399
the professional life of an actor, director, to teaching,

278
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,332
you know I was thinking when we talked about

279
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,566
you know having this interview or this conversation,

280
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:39,099
I was thinking, "My gosh."

281
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,832
Like it helped me retrospect on myself a little bit.

282
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:45,166
And I remember acting school.

283
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:49,499
And acting school for me was a greenhouse of creativity.

284
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,332
Was I could fail miserably.

285
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:55,699
You don't even understand how many times I threw myself out there

286
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,832
and did the most ridiculous things because I could.

287
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,966
You know, because I had the ability to try and fail

288
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:06,766
and I could wake up the next morning and try again.

289
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:09,332
Okay? And that was magical for me.

290
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:13,666
And when I went out from acting school into the professional acting world,

291
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:16,232
I didn't have that anymore. I didn’t have that.

292
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:19,132
Because you go to a casting director,

293
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:20,832
and they're looking at you and

294
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:25,832
you know, what do you sell? What character are you?

295
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:29,666
They don’t want to deal with your creative outlets.

296
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:35,599
They don’t have time. It’s a business, you know.

297
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,266
I love that. They don’t want to deal with your creative outlets.

298
00:24:40,267 --> 00:24:43,699
It's kinda true. Again, unless you are Meryl Streep.

299
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,266
And she's one in the generation you know.

300
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:48,566
She can do anything. She can.

301
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,432
Or Judy Dench.

302
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:53,532
Or you know, there are a number of privilege,

303
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:57,666
you know, God-gifted human being that can be doing that.

304
00:24:57,667 --> 00:25:00,466
But most of us, No.

305
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:02,866
I'm not gonna name famous actors.

306
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:04,366
But you know, you can imagine in your mind.

307
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:09,499
That you see one movie, that you see 10 movies with the same actor.

308
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,832
At the end of the day, they are the same people you know.

309
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:17,732
And then I started teaching, doing activities,

310
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:21,366
And I found that creative outlet again.

311
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:24,266
For that's such a keyword you know.

312
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:31,766
I found the joy of letting my students let them fail.

313
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:37,499
And say to them, "It’s okay to try and fail fabulously."

314
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,466
You know, go all the way.

315
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:41,466
There's no other place we can do that.

316
00:25:41,467 --> 00:25:45,432
I mean, even in sports practices, you're practicing with the team,

317
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:49,132
and even if your coach says, "Yeah, try something and fail miserably."

318
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:51,399
It's not the same. It's so competitive.

319
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,899
And you're always judged.

320
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,132
On stage, you’re not being judged.

321
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:59,799
Well, again, it's really I think depends on the experience that you have.

322
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:06,299
But I think one of my job as a teacher, as an educator,

323
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,966
is to create a safe zone.

324
00:26:10,967 --> 00:26:15,066
When you come into the theater, and yes, no one will judge you.

325
00:26:15,067 --> 00:26:19,899
Because like you, your friend Danny and Johny, will fail.

326
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,566
Maybe not today, but tomorrow.

327
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:23,066
And it's okay.

328
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:27,899
You will all excel at some point and you will all fail at some point.

329
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,566
And it's wonderful because you try things out

330
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:32,532
that you didn’t you had in you.

331
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:35,499
Maybe an accent, maybe a certain walk,

332
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,432
maybe a mimic in the face,

333
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:46,966
and at the end of it, you found how much gratifying it was

334
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:50,299
for them to be able to find that little something in them.

335
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,599
that they didn’t know that they had there.

336
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,632
So, what better job in life is to work with children,

337
00:26:56,633 --> 00:27:00,166
And being able to see them find themselves you know.

338
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:04,232
Liran, incredible. I had a horrible fear of dancing my whole life.

339
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:05,932
And I'll never forget the day you come and say,

340
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:06,866
"Well Michael, you know the rule."

341
00:27:06,867 --> 00:27:09,366
Pepper comes of in minute solo dancing on stage.

342
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:12,366
And am like, "What do you mean? What's dancing?"

343
00:27:12,367 --> 00:27:14,132
And it took time. And it took tries.

344
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,766
And I made a fool of myself quite a few times,

345
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:19,232
And probably up until, and also in the show itself.

346
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:23,266
But looking back, every now and then I find that clip on you tube,

347
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,099
and I was just like, "Wow."

348
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,432
Like I remember how scared I was to dancing.

349
00:27:27,433 --> 00:27:30,432
And here I am on stage, still horribly dancing.

350
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:33,799
Almost falling off the stage. But I'm having so much fun.

351
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,399
With so much confidence.

352
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,599
And it’s all thanks to you.

353
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,432
You gave me that confidence.

354
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:40,966
First of all, thank you so much.

355
00:27:40,967 --> 00:27:46,599
But I do have to say to you that I remember you

356
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:52,199
you know, I can’t be in the head of a teenager because it's been a while.

357
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,832
But in your head, you might have felt this like,

358
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,932
"Oh my God, what does she want from me."

359
00:27:57,933 --> 00:28:01,166
But you never showed that you know.

360
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:04,766
And again, that's another lesson in theater, an improv.

361
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:08,266
But classic improvisation is take, yes and.

362
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:10,666
Yes and. Yes and. Yes and.

363
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:14,166
And you did. And I was able to give you,

364
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:16,299
I could have cancelled the solo.

365
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,199
We had live music. You could have cancelled the solo.

366
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,299
But you said, "Yes and I'll jump from the bar. Yes."

367
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,066
And so you gave me,

368
00:28:25,067 --> 00:28:26,066
That was so dangerous Liran.

369
00:28:26,067 --> 00:28:30,199
I could have broken an ankle looking back that jump.

370
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:36,066
I know. I was young and foolish back then.

371
00:28:36,067 --> 00:28:37,932
But I believe in you guys.

372
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:43,032
And I think that you felt comfortable saying yes.

373
00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:46,032
Because you felt that I believed in you.

374
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:49,432
And I think that it has to go both ways.

375
00:28:49,433 --> 00:28:51,532
You know you've got to trust your director.

376
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:54,099
It's true, I get exasperated and I may scream.

377
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:59,099
And I may yell and blow my brain.

378
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,166
I'm not gonna lie. I'm a very emotional director.

379
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:06,966
Cause I'm a perfectionist and I expect the best from myself.

380
00:29:06,967 --> 00:29:08,566
So I expect the best from my kids.

381
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:11,166
Definitely.

382
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:15,832
But I think I do tried to create a trusting relationship,

383
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:20,999
in which the actor can know that he's in safe hands you know.

384
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,766
I love it.

385
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:28,399
And I always say to the kids, "I will not sleep for two months

386
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,066
to make sure that when you go on stage you are proud of what you do.

387
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:35,199
You will not go on stage feeling ashamed."

388
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,132
We're not doing a play just to do a play

389
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:39,399
because it says in the calendar, "Play in March."

390
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,632
We're doing a play because we are going to be remembering this day forever.

391
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:49,966
And thinking our past days, what a wonderful experience this was.

392
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:55,232
Liran, this is so fantastic and it's impossible to capture in 20 minutes.

393
00:29:55,233 --> 00:29:58,999
The inspiration that you gave me and so many others over so many years,

394
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,266
and I can't believe you're finishing your 10th year

395
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,566
No. It's not my 10th year. I finish my nineth.

396
00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:08,466
It's just as crazy. ‘Cause I remember when you came.

397
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:12,066
And I remember it was all a big startup in school.

398
00:30:12,067 --> 00:30:13,632
Nobody really knew what was happening.

399
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:15,899
None of us knew what's happening.

400
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,232
Incredible, Liran before we leave, the hardest question.

401
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:22,566
The three words that you would use to describe yourself

402
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:30,032
Or that any actor that you worked with describe you as.

403
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:35,232
I think that the first word to mind would be Creative.

404
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,766
Definitely.

405
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:43,099
The other thing would be Insightful.

406
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,632
I have the ability to be insightful.

407
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:50,366
And I think, I don’t know if a co-actor, but as a student

408
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:53,566
I would think I am Younger or Youthful.

409
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:59,066
You know, that would be also something also that I can be relatable.

410
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,399
So, maybe not useful but relatable.

411
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,899
So, these are the three things but I mean there's more.

412
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,832
And not everything is good.

413
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:07,766
A 100%.

414
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:09,466
Liran, I'll add a fourth title.

415
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:13,632
I'll say educator mainly because I didn’t take a single class with you.

416
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:17,966
There’s no record of AIS or my academic record that will show

417
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:19,432
any connection between the two us.

418
00:31:19,433 --> 00:31:22,832
Looking back at my 12 years of education,

419
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:26,766
If I had to choose a few things that really shaped who I am

420
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:29,299
as a thinker and as a human being,

421
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,932
I definitely think that our work together was a major major part of it.

422
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,332
If not the biggest part of it. And here I am you know.

423
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:36,932
I’m an engineer. I’m in AI.

424
00:31:36,933 --> 00:31:39,166
But I’m looking back at this experiences

425
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:41,099
as the one of the most monumental in my life.

426
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,366
And so I like to thank you and to just know of the impact that you're doing.

427
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:46,199
And I'm taking this also as an impact that

428
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,232
drama teachers and theater and directors and choreographers

429
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:52,566
have all over the world on students.

430
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:54,766
And while things are moving on [--]

431
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:58,132
I hope that we are able to retain this thing.

432
00:31:58,133 --> 00:31:59,432
But yeah. Thank you so much.

433
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:01,266
Thank you for being on the show.

434
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:02,699
Thank you so much Michael.

435
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,166
I'm so proud of the man that you've become.

436
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:06,699
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

437
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,700
Thank you, Liran toda raba. Bye bye.
