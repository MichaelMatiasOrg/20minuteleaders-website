1
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:16,299
Danny, thank you so much for being on my show, 20 Minute Leaders.

2
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,099
How are you?

3
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,766
I'm doing great. Thank you for having me.

4
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,066
Definitely. So, we edit this up.

5
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:27,932
But a second ago, I said thank you for having me on 20 Minute Leaders.

6
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:31,732
You know this is actually the 75th or so episode that we're recording.

7
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:34,866
So you would think that by then, I would know how to introduce people.

8
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:37,966
Well I guess that's not just the case.

9
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:41,832
Danny, really really interesting guy that I'm really excited to get to know you better

10
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:45,166
over this next 20 minutes or so.

11
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:48,199
You worked on a marketplace at called Saily,

12
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,232
with the good friend of mine from the Til Summit,

13
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,532
Forbes 30 under 30, now Forbes Tech Council.

14
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:57,566
Talk to me a little bit about where you come from

15
00:03:57,567 --> 00:04:01,432
And how you even got into this entrepreneurial world?

16
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:07,299
Yeah. Well, I come from a very far country in the Middle East, called Lebanon.

17
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:14,432
And, this story actually started 10 years ago.

18
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:15,332
But we have time, I think.

19
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,266
Yeah.

20
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:22,432
Yeah. So, of course as a child, I was just obsessed with computers.

21
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:23,432
Even before the internet.

22
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:27,132
So, we just got our first computer when I was seven years old.

23
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:32,166
But I was more interested in creating, rather than just consuming

24
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:33,632
Like playing games or what's fun.

25
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:35,399
But I wanted to build something.

26
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,499
So, the only tool I had back then was Microsoft PowerPoint.

27
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,199
And I just kind of find a way to build a simple games.

28
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,799
Like just multiple questions games on top of that.

29
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,332
And this was my first encounter to programming.

30
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:59,732
Later on, moving forward. I just went on to computer engineering program.

31
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:05,132
But I quickly realized that they're not teaching us anything practical.

32
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:08,032
So, what we learned was theory.

33
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:11,599
And I wanted to build websites, mobile apps

34
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,032
The iPhone just came out and mobile apps were just very very early stage

35
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:20,966
and I remember I just couldn’t afford to buy a MACs

36
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:27,099
So I went in and work as a waiter, a Barista actually, at a coffee shop.

37
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,266
Wow.

38
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:31,566
So I made enough money to buy the MAC

39
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:33,266
And then the first thing I thought about is

40
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:36,932
Let me just built an app for them, for the coffee shop.

41
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:39,432
Wow. And then I just sold it to them and quit.

42
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:45,032
And started pursuing my career as a software engineer.

43
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:46,932
So you went from a waiter to building an app for the coffee shop

44
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:49,032
and then quit as a waiter and you--

45
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:51,799
Okay. So, then how do you get to--

46
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,466
Let's pause a little bit to Saily.

47
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:57,499
How do you get to building this really incredible marketplace

48
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,999
where in the end you actually merged with Mercari, right?

49
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,332
Yeah. So, for Saily actually it was just Hackathons at the beginning.

50
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,932
Hackathons were still new concept

51
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:09,632
I just went there.

52
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:13,099
I won the first hackathon for some reason.

53
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,999
And then met this guy, he was just 15 years old back then

54
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,799
but he was just very bright and we decided to team up.

55
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,499
And started hacking the judging criteria and making some prizes,

56
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,532
cash prizes [--]

57
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:32,199
At some point, one of the judges was like,

58
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,566 
"Hey you guys, I see you all the time in those hackathons

59
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:36,566
just playing and doing nothing about it.

60
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:38,866
Are you gonna built something?"

61
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:42,699
And we were like, "Yeah. Let's do it."

62
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,466
So we just bought a ticket. Flew to San Francisco.

63
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:50,332
And this is how it all started.

64
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:54,032
And Saily was just the last idea that won the competition.

65
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:57,966
It was just a marketplace to buy and sell secondhand items.

66
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:02,599
So, Saily was actually a hackathon, it was a hackathon idea?

67
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,832
Startup weekend idea. Yeah. That's true.

68
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,066
Oh, very cool.

69
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:10,532
And then it just started growing.

70
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:13,099
Things worked out also somehow.

71
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,699
The timing I think was very good because mobile apps were just on the rise.

72
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,266
And it was kind of like a mobile eBay at that point.

73
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:26,932
And lots and lots of competitors were building those kind of apps

74
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:29,832
at the same time, and raising hundreds millions of dollars

75
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,099
just to grow it up to something.

76
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,166
Like offer up even before LetGo.

77
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:39,566
Even much way before Facebook marketplace and all of those.

78
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:41,399
So, what year are we talking about?

79
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,132
So, Saily it was the marketplace to buy second hand items.

80
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:50,032
And the timing was good for it to grow.

81
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:54,266
And then after six years of working on it,

82
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:58,532
we ended up with joining Mercari.

83
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:01,399
When did you start working on it?

84
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,599
Back in 2013.

85
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,966
2013.

86
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:05,999
Yeah. Oh wow.

87
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,032
Okay. That's really an interesting time to start building mobile apps and marketplaces.

88
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,899
Exactly. Exactly, yeah.

89
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,999
We didn't know back then, but

90
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,299
Of course. Of course.

91
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,399
And what was that experience? You know growing the app from one user yourself

92
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,799
to 500,000 users?

93
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,332
Yeah. That was very exciting times for us.

94
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,532
Because we learn as we were going.

95
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:38,566
We were just growing finding new ways to do user acquisition

96
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:42,899
to find our target market.

97
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,099
Who are the people who are gonna use it.

98
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,366
To fight fraud and scammers.

99
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,099
We were scammed a lot at the beginning

100
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,566
Like those fraudsters but we learned as we--

101
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:54,932
You know, you lose a lot of money but you learn.

102
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:56,299
Tell me about one of those scams.

103
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,966
What were you scammed with?

104
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:02,499
So, usually they get stolen credit cards

105
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,432
And they buy expensive items of our platform.

106
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:07,432
They finish the transaction.

107
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:09,366
And then, at the end of the month

108
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:13,299
Stride would be sending us a dispute saying,

109
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,232
"Hey, this credit card was stolen.

110
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:19,332
We're gonna take the money out of your bank account.

111
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,199
Wooh. Okay.

112
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,732
Stride didn't have fraud detection by then.

113
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,199
It was just very early.

114
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,932
So we had to degrade with other services to forget that out.

115
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:34,666
But by then, we've lost like $20,000 or something.

116
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:39,199
Just because there was a delay before we knew it was happening.

117
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,299
So you know. About marketplaces, you need both ends of the stick.

118
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,532
You need both salaries and the buyers.

119
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:48,999
Right. And you need them upscale in order to really

120
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,799
you know, build a good experience.

121
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,799
So, how do you go about even strategizing how to get

122
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,232
to get really the sellers on this platform.

123
00:09:58,233 --> 00:09:59,799
Exactly, yeah.

124
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,566
Well, what we did was we started at specific cities.

125
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:05,332
So, New York city for example.

126
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,832
And even targeting specific kind of people.

127
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,699
San Francisco, the techies.

128
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,832
Like you know each area with high population

129
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:20,266
has a good amount of people that usually sell and buy specific items.

130
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:22,166
And this is how we initially started then.

131
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:25,632
Then, it just expands as you go and grow.

132
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:28,766
But the initial part is the hardest part to get.

133
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:29,632
Definitely. I'm Sure.

134
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:33,866
Okay, so then you go and you're building this amazing platform.

135
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,332
How many people are you on the team?

136
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,999
We were a small team of five people.

137
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,399
We didn't want to hire people just for the sake of ethics.

138
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,666
Like showing that our company is expanding or growing.

139
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:53,232
And we are very good at fast execution.

140
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:55,899
And getting the best out of every single person.

141
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,666
So were doing at least the work five to 10 engineers for example

142
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:04,532
in another company. A big company for example.

143
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:07,032
It's just the tools that we built.

144
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:11,499
Like we built abstract layer later on which got us into for say under 30.

145
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,699
That was mainly because of Saily.

146
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,232
We were like--

147
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:17,266
So, what is abstract layer?

148
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:19,932
Okay. So, it's an automation platform.

149
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:26,432
We realized that we're building those components and features for Saily

150
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:32,699
And a lot of things are just very similar if you look at it from a high level.

151
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,699
So those are cabled UC that you scrolled through,

152
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:41,466
or [-], or the data showing and interacting with it is very common

153
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,032
across different apps, across different screens.

154
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:46,832
So we just thought about an abstraction to it.

155
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:50,432
Where instead of writing down or coding stuff

156
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:55,232
you can just do it in, let's say two lines of code

157
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:58,999
You can just do what thousands lines of codes could do.

158
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,399
And then this allowed us to build product and features

159
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,766
and everything else. 'til today I'll still use it.

160
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:10,532
With our new startup.

161
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:15,266
It allows us to go in execution from something that would take a month

162
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,032
will take three days.

163
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:20,599
And this a huge to anyone whose pursuing startups

164
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,566
And trying to build fast.

165
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:25,499
So, is that a package or a product? How does it work?

166
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,199
Exactly. It's a framework where you just drag it into your export project

167
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,666
And in our case which for IRC.

168
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:36,299
And then out of the box, it has so much things that you can do

169
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:45,232
to just build the same data, combining and viewing and interactions in seconds.

170
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:49,766
Right. Okay. So, then so you build abstract layer and that gets you on

171
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:53,399
on the Forbes 30 under 30. Congratulations.

172
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,299
And you're on 30 under 32, right?

173
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,966
Yes, yes. We can talk about you later.

174
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:01,066
In another time. Thank you.

175
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:02,232
I can interview you.

176
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:03,666
Sounds great.

177
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:10,466
And then, what is this Forbes Tech Council that you're a part of?

178
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:17,966
So, Forbes Tech Council is, they have very strict requirements to get in.

179
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:24,266
Whether it’s on your startup revenue or net worth

180
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:25,599
or whatever the criteria is.

181
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:33,232
And then once you get in, you start contributing to Forbes Tech.

182
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:37,366
So, you're writing tech articles. You're doing consultancies.

183
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:44,066
And there's also a huge form where everyone from the industry are asking questions

184
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:47,099
and everybody is giving their experiences.

185
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,466
Right. So, it’s a huge network.

186
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:53,599
Actually, it's a small network of successful entrepreneurs

187
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,032
and people in the tech industry.

188
00:13:56,033 --> 00:14:01,966
that can help each other and help others by just sharing their knowledge outside.

189
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:03,299
[-]

190
00: 14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,732
So what do you usually write about?

191
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:06,299
What do you enjoy writing about?

192
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,799
So, for me it's all about engineering productivity for example.

193
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,299
Really. I love that. Yeah, of course.

194
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,299
So, anything from a building tools to help you from the mentality,

195
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,466
how to schedule your day, what kind of things to tackle.

196
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:26,032
So, I care a lot about having just one engineer on my team

197
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:29,032
that can be 20x as others.

198
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:33,899
Just like people who are employed at companies and are doing what they're told to

199
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,499
without even thinking of, how can we make it faster?

200
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,432
How can we build even better things?

201
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:44,032
Definitely. So, you know I'm an engineer by profession as well.

202
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:46,832
How do I increase my productivity and to any other engineers

203
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,699
that might be interested in this.

204
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,432
What should I be thinking of when I prioritize

205
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:54,232
and when I schedule my workday?

206
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:56,832
Okay. That's a very good question.

207
00:14:56,833 --> 00:15:01,066
There are lots of different areas to tackle but for example

208
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,799
what worked for me is having,

209
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,866
I work from home. I've been working from home for more than a year now.

210
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:10,366
And I've done it even before.

211
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,466
So, what really works is this plan.

212
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:18,866
Having a specific daily schedule for yourself and going by

213
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:20,632
Very relevant in covid-19 times.

214
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:23,032
Yeah. Yeah. So, for example for me,

215
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:27,499
I usually wake up at eight by myself, without an alarm

216
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,032
because I'm used to it.

217
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:33,199
And then I have my coffee and breakfast

218
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,966
while having a conversation with my business partner.

219
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:41,099
To discuss the business in general and what we're gonna achieve in the next day

220
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,199
And this day.

221
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,866
Then work for until lunch.

222
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:47,799
Then to our break.

223
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,566
I realized that taking a long break, resets my energy.

224
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:56,799
So, instead of saying that I'm gonna work 12 hours a day,

225
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,599
No, I'm gonna work let's say six hours a day.

226
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,332
But those are highly concentrated hours with a large breaks in between

227
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,566
which resets your energy to 90%.

228
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:12,232
Instead of just trying to go through the day with what's just left.

229
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:17,832
And even I do that again let's say 6PM.

230
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:22,599
If I still want to work more, I can just take a big gap of two hours

231
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,632
three hours, and then go again three hours

232
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:29,899
and those would be very high productivity slots.

233
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,799
Okay. Now, that's just fascinating.

234
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,466
I can talk a lot more about it but I don’t think we have enough time.

235
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:41,199
What I would love to also hear, I don't get to meet many Lebanese entrepreneurs.

236
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,999
And I'd love to hear a little bit about the Lebanese tech scene.

237
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,099
And your interpretation of it.

238
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,132
You know, coming from Lebanon, having the Silicon Valley experience,

239
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,732
being a successful entrepreneur.

240
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:57,299
So, talk to me a little bit about what the ecosystem is like?

241
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,266
And what do you see you're rolling it.

242
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:01,032
Awesome. Yeah.

243
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:06,299
What I can say about Lebanese people is they're very ambitious.

244
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:14,566
The problem is they usually have to travel outside and then shine outside.

245
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:18,799
Because of the very limited opportunities that we have in our country.

246
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:26,099
But again, the tech scene and the startup scene is relatively big

247
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,132
compared to the Middle East.

248
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:37,232
Also in Lebanon, we do have VCs, lots of VCs and angels that helped the ecosystem.

249
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:41,632
But the market is also very tiny.

250
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:45,966
The Lebanese market is super tiny because we have a population of five million.

251
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:49,932
Credit card penetration is still low.

252
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:53,466
So whenever you're building a startup in Lebanon,

253
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:56,599
you're at least targeting the Middle East.

254
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,599
And not just Lebanon.

255
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,699
And usually, people would just decide to travel abroad, Europe or the US.

256
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,499
Just to be able to get even more and excel more.

257
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,099
Sure. So, the people in the community, do they look up to you

258
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,432
as sort of someone whose done it?

259
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:24,032
And who got out, shine, and became an extremely successful entrepreneur.

260
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:27,666
Something that you really read about in the news and on TechCrunch.

261
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,832
And all of the sudden you're coming back.

262
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:33,966
Do they asked you for advice? How do they perceive you?

263
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:37,899
Well, it's not just me. We have a lot of successful entrepreneurs.

264
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:44,699
And whenever we are back home, a lot of the new startups

265
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,066
and people who just experiencing this for the first time

266
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,866
or even couple times that didn't do well,

267
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:54,599
they always look up to people who have achieved something.

268
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,699
Especially if you went to Silicon Valley.

269
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,632
that's [-]. Definitely.

270
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:01,899
But even if you went to other places and built something,

271
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,666
they just ask for advice.

272
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:09,366
They try to see if what's a good way to travel themselves outside

273
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:13,366
to be able to be successful and to do more things outside.

274
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:18,166
That makes a lot of sense. So, do you often go back and forth?

275
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,332
Do you get to do it a lot?

276
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,866
Yeah. Yeah, usually go at three times a year.

277
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:25,199
Oh wow. Yeah, that's a lot. I's a long flight.

278
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,366
Yeah. Oh Yeah.

279
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:30,766
I'm from Israel so it's pretty much the same amount of hours for a flight.

280
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:33,066
20-hour flight usually. Yeah.

281
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:35,766
I got used to it but yeah, it's worth it, I think.

282
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,366
Because you have family there.

283
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:41,599
Because you have all your history, food.

284
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,566
So, lots of things to look forward to. Yeah.

285
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:45,666
A hundred percent.

286
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,166
So Dani, what are you excited about now?

287
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:49,032
There's so much ahead of you.

288
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:50,599
Where do you see yourself moving ahead?

289
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,332
What gets you excited?

290
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,766
Yeah. Well, at some point, in the past couple of years

291
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:59,332
I just realized that this is my life.

292
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:03,832
I'm always gonna be that person starting new companies or,

293
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:07,366
well actually, it's just more of creating values.

294
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:14,632
Creating value on the world which for me is starting new businesses and companies.

295
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:17,232
And this is what I'm doing also right now.

296
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:23,199
Right now, we're also, since we quit from Mercari

297
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,232
because at the end of the day, you wanna work on something that you own

298
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:34,066
and you love. So, this is what I'm working on right now.

299
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:38,466
I'm gonna be working on for a very long time as well.

300
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:43,132
Of course. Of course. And any specific industries that you're especially curious about

301
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:46,166
and that you're joining?

302
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:50,732
Yeah. I'm usually open to different industries especially if there's something new.

303
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:57,899
I tried things and VR for example last year

304
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,366
Like whenever there's something special, crypto or whatever came up

305
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:06,232
I just want to explore. Is there anything that can be built that can help actually.

306
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:09,299
and also make money at the same time.

307
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,866
But I think my strong suit is E-commerce.

308
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:15,699
Because I've been in it for 10 years.

309
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,566
I know the ins and outs.

310
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:23,366
Also, I've been in contact with a lot of bigger competitors as well.

311
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,699
Sure.

312
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,666
You want to be indispensable in something in the market.

313
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:34,166
That you know more than anyone other person probably in the world.

314
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,299
To be able to build some extra value that nobody's seeing right now.

315
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,532
Of course. Dani, 20 minutes is almost up.

316
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:44,666
But I have to ask you my last question which is also my favorite question.

317
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:48,899
Can you tell me three words that you would best describe yourself as?

318
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,232
Or, that maybe your co-founder would describe you as?

319
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:55,666
Looks like an interview question.

320
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:56,566
Definitely.

321
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:57,832
What's your weakest point.

322
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:01,499
I think I'm going for the strongest point. Yeah, I care a lot.

323
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,232
I work way too hard. I'm trying to make too much money for the company.

324
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:14,566
Yeah, I think it could be Ambitious. That's number one.

325
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:20,099
To be Persistent, like always trying to follow things through.

326
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,799
And I'm probably a Geek also.

327
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,099
I love it. That's the most important one, I think.

328
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,632
Yeah.

329
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:28,666
I love it. Dani, thank you so much for the time.

330
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:33,466
Thank you so much for forming this new friendship.

331
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:36,466
And I'd love to continue learning from you.

332
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:39,266
And say hi to your co-founder, a great friend of mine.

333
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:42,466
And I wish you all the best on your next ventures.

334
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:43,799
Thank you so much for having me.

335
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,799
Of course. Take care.

336
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,732
Take care. Bye.

337
00:22:48,733 --> 00:25:23,167
