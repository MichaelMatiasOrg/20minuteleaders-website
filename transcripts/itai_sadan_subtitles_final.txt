Fantastic. Itai Sadan, thank you for joining me on 20 Minute leaders. Thank you for having me. So great to have you. I'm so excited to chat because you're gonna tell me one of the most fascinating stories, I think, that one could tell in the entrepreneurship space which is identifying an emerging market out of a garage in Mountain View with one of your best friends. But I'm not gonna give away the whole story. Itai, how did Duda come about? So, it came about in late 2008 and me, and as you mentioned, a very good friend that I know since actually since high school, we were both here in Palo Alto working back then for SAP. And we were, for a very long time, we were trying to come up we always knew we wanted to do something together, we just didn't know what it would be. And we probably had a thousand different ideas that we thought about over the years and shut them all down for different reasons. And then walking, the actual idea for Duda didn't come up in the garage. It actually came out while walking around on University Ave in Palo Alto. I know you live in Palo Alto so very, very close. It's the one street that has a bar in it. So, everybody knows. So, walking to the Apple store. Okay. This is the same Apple store that Steve Jobs also used to live right in the neighborhood and he used to visit that same store as well. And looking at that first version of the iPhone, the first version of the iPhone came out in 2007. Right. And we were playing around in 2008, and it just dawned on us for the first time that the entire Internet was moving into this device. But who knew? I mean, iPhones came up. They were great. They were tiny. The real first, real good touch interface. How did you realize that, wow, yes, internet is moving to mobile? 'cause we were both engineers and we played with all the technologies. There were phones before that. There were Blackberries and there were Nokias, and we were programming with stuff like WAP and it just was not the experience, it was a very different experience than going to your desktop and getting the full experience of the browser. And suddenly that same experience that you would get on a desktop was for the first time available on a small smartphone. And we knew that they got it. They they did something right. And we were looking back then at some of the first companies that took advantage of that phone and created their dedicated mobile site like Amazon. Did m dot amazon.com and m dot eBay.com and so on. And you just had a different They also created a very dedicated experience for the mobile phone for all these mobile users. And we're looking around and we understood. To build something like Amazon was able to do for a mobile phone, you needed resources. You needed specific skill set. You needed budgets, know-how. And it's a whole different learning experience, right, like the whole user experience. I mean the whole adaptation you have to make as an engineer. I know as a web developer myself, building for the phone is not the same as building for the desktop. Now, okay, Amazon can afford that, right? And so, can eBay. But what about the dentist, or the owner of the pizzeria? Or, take all 200 million small businesses out there. Clearly they don't have the budget, the know-how, and the resources to do that. Right. That was kind of where the epiphany of, we're gonna help the little guy be able to create a store very easily, very simply, so that they can actually compete against the bigger guys in the market. Incredible. So, the first product we launched was called back then, the company was called based on the first product, Duda mobile. We were just about converting desktop sites to mobile site. Wow. And we started working on that in very late 2008. That's just incredible. So, you were working on that about a year and a half after the first iPhone comes out and really the world gets introduced to mobile and a fun user experience that is actually comparable in the amount of things you can do to the computer. I'm gonna give a small spoiler. 10 years later, Duda has over 800,000 websites that it's hosting? That is correct. 800,000? How do you even, I mean looking back, in 2008, you're sitting there in the garage in Mountain View at this beautiful, picturesque moment. Do you even think that you're gonna get to 800,000 websites built with Duda? Well, it always sounds like an overnight success, but it's an overnight success of 10 years with a lot of ups and downs in between. And I remember in 2009, we built the first prototype and we were back to that same street on University Ave kind of knocking on small business doors and asking them, "Do you want a mobile site?" So really starting one by one and getting these small, at least to validate the product and that there was a real need. And it was also, remember 2008, 2009 was a pretty tough time. Yeah. Who has money for this now, right? Yeah. We went to investors. Nobody wanted to invest back then. Nobody saw the need. It was really tough until we had a really great break in early 2010, when we did a deal with AT&T, back then AT&T Interactive, part of AT&T, that saw the opportunity and really wanted the technology in order to sell to their small business customers. Wow. Incredible. Duda. What's Duda? So Duda is a, the product involved - Not the product, Itai, the name. The name Duda? What's Duda? Ah, the name. Of course. The Dude, The Big Lebowski. Have you seen the movie? I have not, but I read your bio and I know the quote and tell me the quote anyways. Okay. Next time you have to do a prep before you do a call with me but yeah. So, see the movie. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. I'm actually, I'll send it to you. So there's a really, many people know it. It's a cult movie. The main character is called "The Dude" played by Jeff Bridges and both Amir and I, my co-founder, we're big fans of that movie. I probably watched it tens of times. Oh, my God. 10, 20 times. My girlfriend screams at me when I watch a movie more than once, so she would have a heart attack she's gonna have a heart attack watching this. Yeah. So, we started watching it back in college in Israel and it became part of the culture. If you're coming to our offices, you'll see different, all the conference rooms have names from the movie. There's the Ringer, Urban achiever, the Rug Room. It's a really funny movie. Yeah. I think you wrote that your favorite quote from the movie is about a rug that ties the whole room together. You have to see the movie. I can't Yeah, but yeah The whole story starts with the main character's rug gets stolen I love it. Itai, you transition, you're very very successful with Duda and now you're also very big in venture capital. You're a part of the J-Ventures Fund, which I'm very happy to be a part of as well. Part of Tel Aviv partners, mentor at UpWest Labs. You invested in TripActions, right? Pretty early on. Yeah. Yeah. In the seed round. Wow. Okay. Ilan Twig, the CTO is a very close friend. I invested in Ilan. Back then, they said "Travel company, something." I said,  "I'm investing in you." He's a good investment then. Turned out to be a very successful company. I just had a really great chat with Dovi, which we released pretty recently. And one of the things we were talking about was impact investing in his whole investment thesis. And I'd love to know because you're not a full time investor, right? You're a part time investor. You're doing it. You can see from your background that you're doing it out of fun. And you're just as much a mentor as you are an investor. So, talk to me a little bit about this strategy of yours and how you cover with companies. Yeah, it's really, I do it as a side hobby. I wouldn't consider myself a real investor. It's just when there is an interesting opportunity and unfortunately I'm so busy in my day to day work that - I would hope, you're responsible for 800,000 websites so please be busy. Yeah so, I would say most of my eggs are in that basket, but once in a while, if there's something, someone I believe in, some opportunity, usually tied to people. It's really tied to people that I know. Definitely. Then, here and there. I don't do it a lot, but it is fun when I do. I love it. And it's fun to, I mainly enjoyed working with them, sharing my experience, discussing challenges. And yeah, so I think that's really the fun part. Itai, I wanna talk about emerging markets. It's very rare to meet somebody who identified an emerging market was right, rode the wave, went through the challenges, raising capital, in 2009, trying to get customers. I mean, I didn't do it myself, but I can see why it would be very difficult. I want to be in your position. I want one day to be able to sit down and think of a new market and really ride that wave and know that, yes, I was right and I made a dent. 'cause you did. You made a huge impact on the Internet world and SMBs presence online. What are some of your insights looking back on identifying emerging markets and riding that wave? Yeah. I think, the first, it's important to find a real pain point and where there's enough people who share that pain point and where you think you can come up with a very unique offering to solve that pain. And I think we found that in late 2008 and with the first product. Right. I think you always need to come back to this whole product market fit, right This is basically what I, building a product that fits with a certain pain in the market. Right. The fact that you've found it doesn't guarantee that it will last forever, and this is where I think over the years, we had our ups and then we had our downs and now we're couple of years of another, like found it again. I think this is the role of the entrepreneur, of the founder, really to make sure that that product market fit is maintained. But it's very hard to get product market fit on the get go when you're looking at an emerging market, right? Because they don't necessarily understand. They don't have iPhones yet necessarily. They don't understand that this is where things are headed. So, it's kind of a chicken and the egg. Right. Are you letting the market take over first and then you're gonna go and try your luck? Or are you gonna try and be on top of the wave? And how do you get your first customers on board? Yeah. I think, it's the hardest to educate a market about something that they don't know they need. But I think, when we came out with the idea for mobile websites back then, we validated the idea. We put some ads on the Internet and because if there's a pain, then people are looking for ways to resolve it. They might not know what the solution is, but we bought some ... campaigns around build mobile website, create mobile website. And the first customers, we actually used our own the technology was not ready to hand it over. We used our own technology to build sites almost like an an agency, as a professional service. So, just to validate that the technology that we built was good enough, it took probably a year like that until we got to a place where we could hand it over to other people to build website on behalf of small businesses, or give it directly to small businesses to do it themselves. Right. What were some of the most unique challenges that you faced as the CEO? You're starting out in a garage with an idea. You're running from door to door to try and sell this, and all of a sudden you're growing and you're scaling and success comes and investors come. What do you tell yourself? Who do you go to? What are some of the things that you experience? Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot packed in that question. A lot. Well, we have five minutes. So, I'm sure we can get through everything, right? Okay, yeah. I think, what I would say is that, I think when you're growing and you're onto something and scaling, growth solves a lot of problems, it creates problems, but it also, when you see growth, then investors see growth and they want to invest and I think that's easier to solve. It's kind of rich man's problems. There are problems that come with growth, but those are solvable. I think the harder challenges is is when you're not seeing, when it's not that clear or when markets change. And that happened to us. If I go to 2014. So we were just doing, think of 2010 to 2013 something like that, we were just selling mobile sites. We got to a huge amount of customers buying from us mobile sites. We had partnerships with GoDaddy and Google and OpenTable and all that. And suddenly, it wasn't as suddenly, but we identified a risk because the web was moving to responsive web design and we're only on the mobile side. And we were looking at this and we're saying, "Wow, we're at a risky place" because suddenly there's tablets, and there's mobiles and desktop and people have browsers on their watches and in their cars. Nobody wants to build a site for every different device. And kind of responsive web design rose as the right way to do it. You build it once, it runs everywhere. So cutting it short, we understood we needed to build for that. We needed to develop our product in that direction. We built another product. Basically, the product that you see today, which is our responsive website builder is our second product. That's the pivoted product from the risk that you identified. So we had to pivot to another product. And luckily that we did it 'cause the decline started happening to our first product. And if we hadn't recognized what the shift in the market, we basically lost product market fit. So we had to rebuild a new product to fit what the market actually wanted and I think those were the tough years of rebuilding that product and relaunching on another product. 2014 to 2016 were two pretty tough years. We even went through a little bit of layoffs back then. Wow. And then eventually with catching the wave again with the new product, we're now five, six years later, obviously we made the right decision. And the company has grown significantly since then. But that was like almost a sudden death moment there where, and you know that there's quite a few companies over the history that kind of missed that, right They had the product market fit, if we're talking about phones BlackBerry, Nokia. I was just about to They were a rubber company did you know that? No, I didn't know that. So, they pivoted once well to phones and to electronics. They didn't complete the pivot though. It's hard. It's hard to do, and maybe for our next conversation, we can talk about what it takes to pivot and the challenges with that. It sounds like to me, it takes a lot of bravery. And it takes a lot of confidence in yourself and the team to be able to say, "Listen, we might not be doing the right thing right now. We did two years ago, but things are changing. And we're, again, going to have to understand our market and to be better again." Now, take that. Think of like at Nokia or BlackBerry where you have thousands of people selling product A and you need to tell these people, "Well, this product that you're selling that's bringing billions of dollars, forget about it. That's history. You need to be selling product B" Understand how difficult it is to transition. And the problem is that you can't wait for the product to stop selling. You have to know ahead of time in advance. So, while you're starting to decline to already start working on the other thing And that's the hardest thing because then they're coming and saying to you, "What are you talking about?" We're still selling." We're making billions of dollars Which marketer would give you real estate on like the home page to put in a new product when everybody's buying the old product. But this is the role of the entrepreneur, the founders, to really understand the dynamics in the market, have the vision, and persuade everybody else to follow that. Itai, what are you passionate about? What am I passionate about? I love working with people, I love working with the team. I love the challenges. Every stage in the company, this is why it always stays interesting because the challenges to get to the first million dollars of revenue is different than the challenges to get to the 10 million which is completely different than the challenges to get to 50 million. So, I think it just keeps it very very interesting and you learn a lot. It's the best, best education that you can get is actually to try to build a business and to scale a business and I think that's something that I really enjoy. I love it. Itai, right before we leave, I wanna thank you again for this great inspiration. It's such a remarkable story. I love emerging markets. I love sitting down and trying to identify what's happening and where is the world moving. Ever since I started with J-Ventures as well. That's I think the biggest gift that a new young entrepreneur can get is to really try and understand what are the dynamics, how do markets work, how do entrepreneurs work. And, Itai, before we leave, I need three words that best describe you. I always manage to keep calm. To be cool. Things get thrown at you from the left and from the right, - You look very calm and cool. and I think you need to know how to cope with it. So I think people, if you ask people will tell you that it doesn't matter One day it could be good news, the next day it could be bad news. You need to plow through it and continue to move on and improve. I love it. Itai, toda raba. I'm definitely reaching back for some advice when I have my own startup. So, look out for that email. And thank you for your time and inspiration. Thank you for having me. It was fun. Take care. Bye.
