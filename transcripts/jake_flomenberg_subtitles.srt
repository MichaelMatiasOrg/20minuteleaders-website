1
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,440
Wonderful. Okay.

2
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,080
Jake Flomenberg, thank you so much

3
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,800
for being on my show

4
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,520
20 Minute Leaders.

5
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,760
How are you?

6
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,480
Good. How are you?

7
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:58,880
Great.

8
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,680
Where are you calling from right now?

9
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm calling from Sunny Menlo Park.

10
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:03,760
Wonderful.

11
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,280
So, we're very very close by neighbors.

12
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,160
But with this covid situation,

13
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,080
it doesn't matter if we're two miles apart

14
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,520
or a thousand miles apart.

15
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,320
So, either way, thank you for being here.

16
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
Very brief overview.

17
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,520
And then we're gonna spend,

18
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,400
we're gonna do a deep dive

19
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,000
into your experiences.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,120
So, you did UPenn.

21
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,360
And then Harvard MBA.

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,240
Went on to working

23
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,600
with the founders of Cloudera

24
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,680
is, I think, the first business hire.

25
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,400
And then running the Splunk UI product,

26
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,960
which I've used extensively,

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,360
back in my years of engineering in the IDF

28
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:37,000
and now moved on to

29
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:39,040
being a venture capital partner

30
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,140
at Accel Ventures and Wing VC.

31
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,400
Did I get that somewhat right?

32
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,480
Roughly correct.

33
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,080
Wonderful.

34
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,960
Jake, I still can't do enough service

35
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,880
to the incredible background

36
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,640
that you have.

37
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,400
I'd love you to tell me

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,520
a little bit more about yourself.

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,680
And then I'd really love to pick your brain

40
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,320
on these experiences.

41
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,720
Moving from engineering,

42
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,160
working with incredible startups early on,

43
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,400
like Cloudera and Splunk.

44
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:02,880
And then making that smooth transition

45
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,960
into venture capital.

46
00:03:03,961 --> 00:03:06,000
And some of your insight

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,520
into your investment thesis

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,480
and how you approach

49
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,920
different opportunities.

50
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,160
Sure. So, why don't I give you sort of

51
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,600
a quick rundown on my background.

52
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,120
And a few of the transition points

53
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,400
I went through.

54
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,160
So, first, I actually did my undergrad

55
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,840
at Duke. I did sort of hardware,

56
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,080
software and engineering,

57
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,000
and said to myself,

58
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:25,680
"Hey, how can I try to solve

59
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,200
problems in the real world?"

60
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,360
And found Lockheed Martin.

61
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,680
And had a lot of fun there

62
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,280
for a few years, had a lot of impact.

63
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,920
But it was also a conservative culture.

64
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,880
Where it's hard for a 21 year old

65
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,840
to take on increasing amounts

66
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,160
of responsibility.

67
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,840
So, I went to business school to retool,

68
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,120
and this was in 2008.

69
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:45,640
And I, sort of, came upon two trends.

70
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,440
I was interested in cloud and data

71
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,920
In cloud, it was the early days

72
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,840
of things like Amazon Web Services.

73
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
But they were a thing at that point.

74
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,600
And I said,

75
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,640
"You have to be a big company

76
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,400
to play in this game."

77
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:58,640
And data. And the more I looked

78
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,360
at this field of big data,

79
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,120
the more I realized,

80
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:03,760
"Hey, I think I know a thing or two

81
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,640
about this topic."

82
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,000
I feel just from reading the trade rags,

83
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,400
like I could be useful here.

84
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,880
Yeah.

85
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,280
So, when summer came around,

86
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,520
I just found every single

87
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,680
big data company I could.

88
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,160
And one of them was called Cloudera.

89
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,760
They had about 12 employees.

90
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,120
Oh my God.

91
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,480
And I called them off and said,

92
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,160
"Hey, can I help?"

93
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,320
Literally I phone called the CEO, Mike.

94
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,320
And I spoke to all the founders.

95
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,200
I spoke to the CTO armor.

96
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,360
And I think he actually thought

97
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,080
I was interviewing

98
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,560
for a software engineering job

99
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,520
in the beginning.

100
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,080
And so, I never had the heart to ask him

101
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,400
how that interview went.

102
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,400
I think it's pretty poor.

103
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,000
So, they said,

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,440
"Hey, come help."

105
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,760
And it was just,

106
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,360
there were just engineers.

107
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,080
And so, as we thought about

108
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,880
some of the initial product roadmaps

109
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,600
or business packagings

110
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,320
and things like that,

111
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,680
I gotta play a really fun role in that.

112
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,200
It was a lot of fun.

113
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,960
But at the same time,

114
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,520
it was a sort of deeply deep technology

115
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,200
for technologists.

116
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,600
And I said to myself,

117
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,880
as I was leaving business school,

118
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,000
"Hey, how do we help mere mortals

119
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,680
get some value out of data?"

120
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,640
It's great to help people

121
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,600
that can write lots of code,

122
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,440
but how do we help

123
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:17,400
less technologically savvy people

124
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,640
benefit from these systems?

125
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,120
And I found Splunk, and I said, "Wow."

126
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,920
Splunk is sort of this vertically

127
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,520
integrated big data application.

128
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,800
They didn't call themselves that.

129
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,480
But that's in effect, what they were.

130
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,320
They were serving

131
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:29,720
mostly assistant men

132
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,560
or IT people. Still deep.

133
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,760
But  maybe not quite as deep.

134
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,920
And I saw, I had a vision.

135
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,480
I saw the ability for them

136
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,440
to use this platform

137
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,400
to service even less technically

138
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,880
sophisticated people over time.

139
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,800
So, I joined Splunk.

140
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,120
And I was there for a couple years

141
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,240
right up to their IPO

142
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,840
and looked after pretty much

143
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,440
anything you could touch.

144
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,280
And then, right around that time,

145
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:56,480
when Splunk was getting ready

146
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
to go public,

147
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,960
I joke that the VCs were typing

148
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,520
into their LinkedIn search box,

149
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,240
"NBA plus big data."

150
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,960
And I was one of the four hits.

151
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,040
In 2012, there only four hits.

152
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,760
And so a large number of people

153
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,480
reached out.

154
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,680
And I decided to make the move

155
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,600
over to Excel,

156
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,920
where I had known some of the guys.

157
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,920
I met them through sitting in

158
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,000
on a board meeting at Cloudera.

159
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:25,320
And focused a lot on data and analytics.

160
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,200
And so, that daps of sort of knowledge

161
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,480
and firsthand experience

162
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:31,200
really enabled me to focus

163
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,720
on a domain or focus area.

164
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
And which is what I did

165
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,960
when I started at Excel.

166
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,400
I was there for about six years

167
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,480
and then I came over to Wing.

168
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:41,760
And at Wing, our focus

169
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,960
is really trying to just build

170
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,440
help entrepreneurs on that journey

171
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,920
from zero to product market fit

172
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,560
and beyond.

173
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,520
And so, almost putting on

174
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:50,280
my product manager hat and saying,

175
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,600
"Hey, I wanna do one thing really well."

176
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,000
There's lots of ways as investors

177
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:57,360
to make money with consumer funds

178
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,200
and growth funds.

179
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,080
And China and India strategies.

180
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,440
But let's build a product to us

181
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,040
as a VC firm around one thing,

182
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,520
which is helping enterprise

183
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:10,200
B2B entrepreneurs on that initial journey.

184
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,120
Wow. Okay.

185
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,280
I don't even know where to begin.

186
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,760
I wanna go back to Cloudera and Splunk

187
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,640
because those two are

188
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,600
incredible incredible companies,

189
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,560
Really, innovators, a field

190
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
that I'm very passionate about.

191
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,520
And Splunk, what was it like

192
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,160
going into a company

193
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,560
that has product market fit

194
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:31,880
with a certain demographic?

195
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,120
So, right. Sysadmins and people who are,

196
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,400
still, they're might not be necessarily

197
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:37,920
the engineers at the company,

198
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,480
but they're very tech savvy.

199
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,360
Today, Splunk services,

200
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,080
any person who's able to just to look

201
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,160
at graphs and just connect the dots.

202
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,720
Right?

203
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,520
And so, what is that like

204
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,400
coming into company

205
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,760
and thinking of this vision

206
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,440
and seeing a product that right now

207
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,600
serves a certain demographic

208
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:55,880
but trying to extrapolate it

209
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:58,240
onto a larger market?

210
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Yeah. I can't take too much credit here.

211
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,640
But I can certainly describe the thought

212
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,800
process going on at a product company.

213
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,160
And it's roughly as follows,

214
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,880
people initially at the time,

215
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,720
they actually bought Splunk

216
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,040
for an IT use case.

217
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,280
Today, if you look at their financials,

218
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,720
you might see it's actually a little bit

219
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,440
more slanted to security in many cases.

220
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,480
But back then, it was it was mostly IT.

221
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,200
And you would help people get to this,

222
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,880
what we called an "Aha moment".

223
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,240
They'd find some sort of magical value.

224
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,760
And if you're deeply technical,

225
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,120
it's a super graph.

226
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,520
Where graphing across

227
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,720
all the different boxes.

228
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,280
We're finding that logline we need

229
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,640
to solve our problem.

230
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,880
And if you do that a hundred times faster

231
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,920
and swamped than logging on to each box,

232
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:40,040
you're very happy.

233
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,320
And most people actually did that

234
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,240
with the free product,

235
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,600
with a free trial or a free download.

236
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,760
And so, they were very excited

237
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,080
by the time a salesperson

238
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,680
actually contacted them and say,

239
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:52,320
"You know, you wanna pay for this."

240
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,120
Is that generally the case that,

241
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,440
So, obviously, this idea

242
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,840
of the freemium model is that

243
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,000
you try to get your users to an aha moment

244
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:06,000
as they're just risk free taking a stab

245
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,040
at the software.

246
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,000
And then when the salesperson

247
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,840
comes around, it's easy.

248
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,560
But that sounds like

249
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,240
something very difficult to do, right?

250
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,160
For any company?

251
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,640
Look, one, I think Splunk

252
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,880
was one of the pioneers

253
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,400
in the true enterprise space,

254
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,720
that sort of easy use, quick value

255
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,440
is something that's now become the norm,

256
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,360
the consumerization of Enterprise.

257
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,760
That wasn't the tagline back when

258
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,080
Splunk got started.

259
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,000
And they made a bunch

260
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,400
of very thoughtful product

261
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
and pricing decisions.

262
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,920
But they also,

263
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,040
they had a great market.

264
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,880
They just had this opportunity

265
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,680
where you could make

266
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:40,920
in the moment of truth

267
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,040
when the pager goes off,

268
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,920
you could help someone.

269
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:45,560
If you're building a payroll system,

270
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,400
you can delight them.

271
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,360
But you can't make them say, "Aha."

272
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,760
And in quite the same way

273
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,640
for the most part, right?

274
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,480
It's a sort of depends

275
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,240
what space you're in

276
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,120
and you help them solve an acute problem

277
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,320
in a moment of need.

278
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,760
And of the back of that,

279
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,200
you were able to build a relationship.

280
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,960
You were able to eventually

281
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,040
have a financial transaction that happens.

282
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,600
And then, the way to think about

283
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,360
serving other users is really to say,

284
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,680
"Hey, you put in X data."

285
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,200
What if you put in 1.25x data,

286
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,120
that's 25% more data

287
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:23,120
and now you can enable use case Y, right?

288
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,480
And so, that's what security was,

289
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,160
which was the clear second use case.

290
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,560
We have to build more content

291
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,920
for the security practitioners.

292
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,760
Some of them are very sophisticated code,

293
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,520
like Python and understand

294
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,600
the sponsors language.

295
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,440
Others need, they need charts.

296
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,840
They need dashboards to do their job.

297
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,320
And so, we'll build those

298
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,360
canonical dashboards.

299
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,400
You'll pay us for those.

300
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,160
You pay us to put more data into Splunk.

301
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,960
And now we serve as the second use case.

302
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,640
And then so on and so forth.

303
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,160
And I think within IT and security,

304
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,640
Splunk has done a phenomenal job.

305
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,680
And we'll continue building content

306
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,680
to serve as many many other markets

307
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,600
over time.

308
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,560
So, now you're moving on to Wings VC.

309
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,720
And over there, you mentioned that

310
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,280
your focus is on helping entrepreneurs

311
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,000
get their B2B SAS platform

312
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,760
to that product market fit

313
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,480
and beyond, right?

314
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,280
From the very early stages.

315
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,560
So, what are some of the things

316
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,920
that you're observing as you're going

317
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,040
through this journey?

318
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,360
What are some of the common challenges

319
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,120
that you're observing?

320
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Because you're really seeing entrepreneurs

321
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,280
very very early on

322
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:28,040
as they might have an MVP

323
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,920
and they're trying to get

324
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,920
these enterprises to buy into it.

325
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,560
It doesn't sound very easy to me.

326
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,200
Yeah. What I mean,

327
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,280
so, we have a tendency to work

328
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,600
with deep technological founders

329
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,760
who have an insight about

330
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,400
a particular domain area.

331
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,360
And this might be core IT

332
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:45,960
or it might be in the real world.

333
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,480
I spent a lot of time looking at things

334
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,160
like computer vision these days.

335
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,200
And I have to tell you that

336
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
there's gonna be some value

337
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,320
in core enterprise.

338
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,160
But a lot of the value of these systems

339
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,560
is out in the real world

340
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,960
where you can see things and react.

341
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,640
And some struggling,

342
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,560
there's a lot of struggles

343
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,840
that these entrepreneurs go through.

344
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,040
Hiring the right people

345
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,400
is certainly a struggle.

346
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,320
Most people don't struggle all that much

347
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,160
in hiring the tech talent on

348
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,200
in the early days.

349
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,600
But that initial business model,

350
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,840
that initial go to market strategy,

351
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,960
sometimes that's something

352
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,720
that the entrepreneur has done before.

353
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,040
Often this is a new domain

354
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,920
or that might be

355
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,200
a completely foreign to them.

356
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,920
And so that's an area where

357
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:29,400
we really tried to roll up our sleeves

358
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,800
and not do, but help and support, right?

359
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,520
And say, here's an example

360
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,280
of a head of sales for a company

361
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,120
in adjacent space

362
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,040
that's at public company scale.

363
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,280
You're never gonna hire them,

364
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,760
but maybe they're great adviser.

365
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,240
Here's an example of the marketing

366
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,120
candidate you're gonna want

367
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,320
in another year, right?

368
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,920
And so, try to surround them with people

369
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,880
and sort of thought partners

370
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:54,160
that they can use

371
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,080
to continually evolve their thinking

372
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:57,960
and just encouraging people

373
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,160
to take that experimental mindset.

374
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,360
Sometimes people treat

375
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,280
you're to market like this black box

376
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,560
or we hire a BPO sales,

377
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,520
spend a couple million of dollars

378
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,360
and see what happens.

379
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,960
And, it's two years in

380
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:11,480
and a lot of money wasted

381
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,160
before you can make any changes.

382
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,200
And so, that's where the area for sure,

383
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,320
where we most repetitively

384
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,480
and deeply engage.

385
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,760
It's not very common for institutional VCs

386
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,200
to come in that early on, right?

387
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,920
I mean, I know a lot of VCs like to join.

388
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,200
And once you have some great returns,

389
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,600
and you have a good ARR,

390
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,960
and you're ready to take

391
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:37,560
your series A and grow.

392
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,960
It depends.

393
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,200
You should check out the wing.vc blog

394
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,640
if you wanna see some pretty deep analysis

395
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,040
by my partner Peter

396
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,360
that really unpacks those trends.

397
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,960
What I'd say is that as follows,

398
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:52,080
wing invest in three buckets:

399
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,360
the experimental seed bucket, which is

400
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:54,720
we'll call it

401
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,080
"a two million dollar check."

402
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,920
Maybe there's some deep

403
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,680
technological risk.

404
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Can you even build this?

405
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,120
Does this market even exists?

406
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
We invest in this round.

407
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,960
We call the power seed, which is,

408
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:07,360
maybe it's a four to six

409
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,600
million dollar financing.

410
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,760
It takes a long time to build

411
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,280
deep enterprise tech.

412
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,240
And some people are marketing these things

413
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,840
as seed extensions or seed tools, which,

414
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,600
in my humble opinion,

415
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
is not great marketing.

416
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,160
Someone says,

417
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:19,720
"Oh, I've raised my seed extension."

418
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,000
and I'd say,

419
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,200
"I'm sorry for your loss."

420
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,280
So, I think we could do better

421
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,560
in branding these things.

422
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,040
And then the classic series A,

423
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,440
which fluctuates a bit.

424
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,120
We ramped up really high in 2019.

425
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,280
Maybe this is that eight to $15 million

426
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,120
check size.

427
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:36,280
And wing actually aspires to invest

428
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,960
across this entire spectrum.

429
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,480
Wonderful.

430
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,360
And I think you see some large firms

431
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,160
that they sort of dabble.

432
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,880
They'll play in this experimental seed

433
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,720
or power seed phase.

434
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,240
Certainly, in light of covid,

435
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,560
we've seen some people

436
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,040
redouble their efforts a little bit there.

437
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,680
But you're right,

438
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,880
a lot of people are waiting

439
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,840
for the series A.

440
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,320
And 82% of the series A's these days

441
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,080
have post revenue.

442
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,200
And if you look at the valuations,

443
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
what are the series As?

444
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,040
These are the series B

445
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,400
is from a decade ago.

446
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,360
That is simply what they are.

447
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,680
And so, this power seed phase

448
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,200
where we have a little bit of product,

449
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,560
we have probably,

450
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,480
we're still pretty revenue in many cases.

451
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,280
We've engaged with the customers

452
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,120
meaningfully.

453
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:24,360
That's an area that we feel

454
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,200
really well equipped to play.

455
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,920
We're happy to roll up our sleeves.

456
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,480
We're happy to talk to those customers

457
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:30,800
and figure things out.

458
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:32,880
With the entrepreneur,

459
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,160
there's some firms that will participate

460
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,520
and engage in such a process.

461
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,480
And there's many others that will say,

462
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:41,080
"Hey, let's just wait until it's obvious."

463
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,000
Right. So, investing in deep technology,

464
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,160
it's a different type of investment than,

465
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:49,120
than going mainly of the market

466
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,160
and just the financials.

467
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,320
You're actually looking sometimes

468
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,880
at founders who are who are really,

469
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,040
they think that they've understood

470
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:59,000
their niche much better than others.

471
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,160
And they are able to develop something

472
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,640
that is cutting edge and that is really

473
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,640
going to innovate on their domain.

474
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,600
They're not just going in

475
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,960
and trying to take a similar technology

476
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,040
that exists and implement it

477
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,200
into another market.

478
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,440
How do you go in about doing

479
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,680
proper due diligence on that?

480
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,680
And how do you, as a venture capital firm,

481
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,360
support entrepreneurs who are dedicated

482
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,760
to deep technology?

483
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,240
Because innately they're spending

484
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,640
years of research on these things

485
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:23,800
and then you have to come in

486
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,280
and you have to determine

487
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,880
within a matter of days or weeks

488
00:16:26,881 --> 00:16:27,880
whether this is something

489
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,160
that you believe in.

490
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,480
Yeah. The way you describe it,

491
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,560
makes it sound hard.

492
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:35,720
On the other end,

493
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,240
I don't know how hard it is, right?

494
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,320
So, I have enough

495
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,840
of a technical background

496
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,640
but I can't go toe to toe

497
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,600
with these entrepreneurs.

498
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,480
Maybe I can pretend

499
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,360
for some period of time,

500
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,560
but I can determine whether or not

501
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,280
something is real.

502
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,160
Whether is this BS or is this real?

503
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,600
And then if it's real, we do the following:

504
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,040
one, we're gonna find

505
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,520
the foremost domain authority

506
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,920
to help validate the elements of risk

507
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,320
that we see in the technology.

508
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,520
Whether that's the computer vision,

509
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,550
with the AI,

510
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,830
the containers or,

511
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,070
whatever it happens to be.

512
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,840
And then, depending on the state

513
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,440
of the product,

514
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,040
we're gonna go out

515
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,600
and talk to the customers

516
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,160
and understand what their perception is,

517
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,080
what it is that they have

518
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,040
and haven't been able to validate.

519
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,880
What it is that they may need.

520
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,350
How it is that they're going to procure.

521
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,520
And then we line everything up and say,

522
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,960
"All right, here's the scorecard."

523
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:28,920
"Here's the risks

524
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,400
and opportunities we see."

525
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,280
"Does this make sense?"

526
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:32,800
"And do you think

527
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,560
that this entrepreneur

528
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,440
is uniquely capable of navigating

529
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,070
through this environment?"

530
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,830
Wow. Very very cool.

531
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,080
And it's really sounds like

532
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:43,020
a lot of the experiences that you've had

533
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,440
leading up to the venture capital world

534
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,560
have really come together

535
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,070
to give you this balanced

536
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,480
and well-rounded insight

537
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,000
into the different things you're doing.

538
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,640
Do you feel,

539
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,520
and I'm now I'm speaking

540
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,400
as a young entrepreneur

541
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,640
and a lot of my friends

542
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,600
who are  following this,

543
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,880
they're also young engineers,

544
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,680
young entrepreneurs,

545
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,640
perhaps out of 8200 in Israel

546
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,840
or perhaps out of Stanford,

547
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,270
or MIT here in the US.

548
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,760
And now, my question is

549
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
you've had a variety

550
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,600
of different experiences,

551
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,360
both in engineering

552
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,270
and in product management in business,

553
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,440
do you think there are some  experiences

554
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,520
that were more worthy of your time

555
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,550
than others that,

556
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,280
because in my generation,

557
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,480
we have to make a lot of decisions

558
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,240
all the time.

559
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,520
Which companies do we go to?

560
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,400
What fields do we study?

561
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,830
How long do I wanna be an engineer

562
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,920
before I make my transition

563
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,110
to product management?

564
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,960
Just as an example,

565
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,240
it's something that I'm grappling with

566
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,080
and a lot of my friends

567
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,400
are grappling with.

568
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,760
Which experiences do you think

569
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,790
really move the needle for you?

570
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,600
Well, look, it all depends

571
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:41,560
what you wanna accomplish in your career.

572
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,040
And I'll make two points:

573
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:48,680
One, it's almost impossible to become

574
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,510
more technical over time.

575
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,920
Once you leave the engineering ranks,

576
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,440
you've left the engineering ranks.

577
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,510
Most people don't circle back, right?

578
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,560
And so, people often rush to get on with it

579
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,080
or become a product manager

580
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,830
or whatever that is.

581
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,160
But for the most part,

582
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,070
that's a one way trip.

583
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,840
So, choose your decision path wisely

584
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,520
and know that maybe 20, 30 years ago,

585
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:15,520
people didn't really empower

586
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,800
technical ICs, individual contributors,

587
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,270
in the same way that they do today.

588
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,510
And you have to become at least a manager.

589
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:21,880
Right?

590
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,720
Or your paycheck

591
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,550
wasn't getting any bigger.

592
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,840
And companies like Google and others

593
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,160
have done a great job really saying,

594
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,960
"Hey, there's a path to become

595
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,600
a level eight or whatever it is, IC

596
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,880
and get rewarded for it."

597
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,030
So, like that's a viable career strategy.

598
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,920
Actually, one of the most incredible,

599
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,240
innovative things that I've observed

600
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,440
in the Israeli military

601
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,720
is this exact same idea that

602
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,760
the Israeli military was

603
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,560
it's known that you want to go higher,

604
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,920
you have to become an officer

605
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,040
and you have to grow your ranks

606
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,680
and get your different ranks or whatever.

607
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,440
And all of a sudden

608
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,160
in the intelligence unit, they're saying,

609
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:56,240
"Oh, we actually have a new method."

610
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,760
"You don't have to be an officer."

611
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,550
"You can be a professional technologist

612
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,160
and you get paid just as much."

613
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,480
And actually, they get paid

614
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,480
more than the officers

615
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:06,920
and they become this professional persona.

616
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,920
Yeah, well, I mean, if you think about it,

617
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,070
some engineers are not

618
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,920
the most gregarious people in the world.

619
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,640
Some of them love to manage,

620
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
love to talk to people.

621
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,560
There's others that don't.

622
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
There are two orthogonal skill sets.

623
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,720
And why you would

624
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,440
forcibly lump them together,

625
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,240
creates suboptimal allocation

626
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,280
of talent resource.

627
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,000
100%.

628
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,720
So, one, don't rush to become

629
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,520
less technical.

630
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,520
Two, I think being a CEO

631
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,200
or being a product manager

632
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,800
is the closest that you can get

633
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,720
to possibly preparing yourself

634
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,440
for a career in venture.

635
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,240
And what I mean by that is,

636
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,240
simply that these people sit at the

637
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,510
intersection of business and technology.

638
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,000
They're not just writing the code

639
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,750
and they're not just selling it.

640
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,680
And that ability to sit on both sides

641
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,520
of the fence is very important

642
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,240
in evaluating a business.

643
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,480
I wish it was just filled

644
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:02,640
with the right technology,

645
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:03,600
the best technology,

646
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,350
and that wins.

647
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,640
That's decidedly not the case

648
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,590
in the real world.

649
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,510
So, you really need both perspectives.

650
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,000
And I joke with product managers

651
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,200
that venture capital is sort of like

652
00:21:14,201 --> 00:21:15,920
mad product management.

653
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:16,680
In some sense.

654
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,720
You don't get it right any of this facts.

655
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,960
You don't get to manage

656
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,750
the CEOs in the same way.

657
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,720
But at a different level,

658
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,480
that is how I think about this case.

659
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,360
I haven't thought about

660
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,840
this  transition

661
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,880
and that the product management side

662
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,240
has such a big influence

663
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,830
on the venture capital work.

664
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,880
And I don't believe

665
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,000
that most venture capitalists

666
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,200
have had much product

667
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,310
management experience.

668
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,080
I know some of them have.

669
00:21:43,081 --> 00:21:44,040
A lot of them come from

670
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,240
financial backgrounds, right?

671
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,750
From finance or potentially CEO.

672
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,960
But this is something that

673
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,920
it's very interesting to me.

674
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,160
Well, particularly at the early stage

675
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,830
of enterprise B2B companies,

676
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
I think it's a really

677
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,320
relevant background to have.

678
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:58,960
Definitely.

679
00:21:58,961 --> 00:21:59,960
You're out raising

680
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,040
your growth capital around.

681
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,280
It can still be interesting.

682
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,310
But there's a lot of people that,

683
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,040
are gonna be a lot more facile

684
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,240
with the metrics

685
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,160
and the spreadsheets.

686
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,920
But in that early days,

687
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,680
having a support system,

688
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,760
a thought partner to help navigate

689
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,560
some of those issues

690
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,590
on the product side.

691
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,400
I think can be immensely valuable.

692
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,840
Hopefully, some of the entrepreneurs

693
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,200
I work with have found that

694
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,160
to be the case.

695
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,600
Jake, this was so enjoyable.

696
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,600
And time just goes by way too quickly

697
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,680
on this show.

698
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,440
I always joke that I wish I called it

699
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,360
30 minute leaders

700
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,640
instead of 20 minute leaders.

701
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:36,110
But now, I'm stuck with the names.

702
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,640
So, I have to hold on to 20 minutes.

703
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,400
But before we go,

704
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,830
I have to ask you for three words

705
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,110
that you would use to describe yourself.

706
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,070
Three words that describe myself.

707
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,000
Intelligent.

708
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,240
I think I try to work hard.

709
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,790
I'm dependable.

710
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,160
I'm there when I'm needed.

711
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,840
That's not something

712
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,760
that you take for granted.

713
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,000
Dependable. It's something

714
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,480
that I've learn over time.

715
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,320
I'm there in good times

716
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,790
and bad times.

717
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,200
There's a lot of stresses

718
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,550
as being an entrepreneur.

719
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,800
And you need folks that are

720
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,040
gonna show up when you needed.

721
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,360
Yeah. And also I have to go

722
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,160
for the alliteration,

723
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,000
so, probably, deep.

724
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:13,920
I wanna go deep to really understand

725
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:15,880
what it is that people are building

726
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,240
and trying to accomplish.

727
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,830
So, there you go.

728
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,240
I love it.

729
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,240
So, dependent, diligent and deep.

730
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,160
Jake, thank you very. very much.

731
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,000
It was wonderful.

732
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,200
I learned so much.

733
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,360
I really appreciate you

734
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,000
taking the time to do this.

735
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,680
Absolutely.

736
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,200
Thanks so much for doing it.

737
00:23:31,200 --> 00:24:19,440
Take care. Bye bye.
