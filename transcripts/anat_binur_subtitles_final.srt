1
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,332
Anat, thank you so much for joining me

2
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,432
on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:03,832
Happy to be here.

4
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,866
Thanks for having me.

5
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:07,166
This is so so great.

6
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:08,799
We met. I can't believe it was like

7
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,899
five years ago.

8
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,232
I think when I sat

9
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:13,532
on like a teenage entrepreneur

10
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,932
side of the table and pitched this idea,

11
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:18,132
which is actually about dietary restrictions,

12
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:19,066
which is why

13
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:21,466
we're gonna have a great time talking

14
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:22,699
about your new startup.

15
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,632
Way too many things to even give

16
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:26,266
about your bio,

17
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:27,866
but just as a quick introduction.

18
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:30,332
You know, founder of the Meet Program

19
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,499
which will I'd love to know more about.

20
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,799
Investment partner at

21
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,466
Innovation Endeavors,

22
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:35,599
one of the most remarkable

23
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,166
venture capital funds in the world.

24
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:40,266
And we both know Dror

25
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:41,732
and I get so much inspiration from

26
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:43,932
just seeing the strategy that all of you

27
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:45,832
have built out and the investments

28
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,732
you've made over there.

29
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,466
And now, you went back to being

30
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:50,799
a founder which many would say -

31
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,999
Definitely not the typical route.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,432
Anat, you know,

33
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:56,532
let's just start from the back.

34
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:59,066
Meet. It is such a unique program

35
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:00,399
and with so much impact

36
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,732
that we have to give it first.

37
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:03,366
Sure.

38
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:04,332
I have to say actually,

39
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,066
I'm so happy also starting it

40
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,366
because you can’t ignore

41
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:08,932
what’s going on outside today.

42
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:10,532
So, for me, as you know we

43
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:11,599
both come from a place

44
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,632
where conflict and kind of ethnic strike

45
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:15,932
has been a part of our life

46
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:18,266
and history and every moment

47
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:19,632
and Meet definitely originated

48
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,832
in our effort to solve it.

49
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,532
So, just to say what is.

50
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:23,566
You know, it's a non-profit

51
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:25,599
that we started in 2004.

52
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,899
I started it with my brother

53
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,932
and one of our best friends

54
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:30,066
in 2 other Palestinian women,

55
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:31,566
and the idea was really to solve

56
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,166
the Israeli-Palestine conflict

57
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:34,066
or have an impact on it

58
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:35,732
by creating a network

59
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:36,732
of future leaders.

60
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:38,232
And we do it by bringing

61
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,499
excelling youth on both sides

62
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,199
to a really rigorous three-year program

63
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,966
and an alumni program

64
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:45,432
where they get taught

65
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,766
by an instructors from MIT

66
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:47,966
and Google and Facebook

67
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:49,232
and many many other companies.

68
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:50,999
And they learn computer science and

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,199
entrepreneurship and leadership

70
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,366
and kind of really

71
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,332
build initiatives together.

72
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,666
And the goal is for them

73
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,266
to become political, social

74
00:03:58,267 --> 00:04:00,599
changemakers in their community.

75
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,132
To really change the status quo.

76
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:03,499
Incredible.

77
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:03,966
So, you actually are looking

78
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:05,166
at this conflict and saying,

79
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:06,232
Yeah, so there's a lot of things

80
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:08,432
that are happening on the top level

81
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:09,666
of decision makers,

82
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,899
but actually, why don't we take

83
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,366
a more bottom-up approach

84
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:13,966
and let's target those that are

85
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:15,332
going to be the next leaders,

86
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,899
and maybe if we can spark

87
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,766
some curiosity

88
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:19,832
and some liberal thinking

89
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,166
and open mindedness early on,

90
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:23,832
we can see great things happening.

91
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:24,699
Yeah. And I think you know,

92
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,266
again think about what's going on

93
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,399
in our world right now,

94
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,366
it's really about the

95
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:30,132
human connection, the humanity.

96
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:32,032
It's being able to understand

97
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:33,199
that even when someone is

98
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,199
totally different from you,

99
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,099
and you have perceptions

100
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,032
that we all have commonalities

101
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,599
and identities. And can we connect

102
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,666
around those places first.

103
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,032
And if you think about your experience,

104
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:42,966
probably at Stanford,

105
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:44,432
you know definitely my experience,

106
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:45,766
it's one of the things that hooked us

107
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:47,366
and led us to start Meet.

108
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,032
It's the networks in our lives

109
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:50,999
that change the way we look

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,566
at the world.

111
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:54,032
Right I always call 'em like the glasses

112
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:54,699
in which you see the world,

113
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,699
so if you suddenly met,

114
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,532
I call it like the newspaper test.

115
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:58,532
You know one of my best friends

116
00:04:58,533 --> 00:04:59,999
in my masters was from Chile.

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,866
I never read an article

118
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:03,599
before I met her about Chile,

119
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,799
but suddenly I became really curious

120
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,632
had a lot of knowledge.

121
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:08,132
So, this is very much simplifying the idea.

122
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:10,432
Can it solve the Israeli-Palestine conflict

123
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:12,499
through that? You can start to bind

124
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,166
and create commonalities

125
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:15,199
and break down the barriers

126
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,799
and we do it also focusing

127
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,699
on young leaders

128
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,599
thinking that the impact model

129
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,132
is really putting people later on

130
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:24,132
in powerful positions who understand

131
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:25,866
the benefits of working together

132
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,299
and actually have the active network.

133
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,366
Right? Because it's those networks,

134
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:30,532
they don’t only change how you see

135
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,599
the world, but they are your tools

136
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,232
for making an impact. Right?

137
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,499
It’s like, when you see a problem,

138
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,666
the first thing you think about is,

139
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,099
"Who do I know that knows,

140
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,932
that can help me solve this?"

141
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,732
And when Israelis and Palestinians

142
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:42,832
never get to interact,

143
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,366
do not know each other,

144
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:45,666
they don't have each other.

145
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,232
And you know, in each other

146
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:48,899
they don't exist in each other’s

147
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,066
professional and social networks

148
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:57,166
and we're really breaking that.

149
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,932
I've lost you?

150
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:00,099
There. No we're back

151
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,032
Good we can edit this.

152
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:02,666
And I have to say,

153
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:05,666
and it speaks so truly to me.

154
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:06,999
You know, coming in to Stanford.

155
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,032
I did grow up on the line

156
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,466
between Palo Alto and Tel Aviv

157
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:11,666
but honestly it was the same type

158
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:13,199
of people. And you don't

159
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,766
really get to introduced

160
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:14,432
to the whole world,

161
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:14,966
and all of a sudden

162
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:16,932
my best friend here on road trip with me,

163
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:18,632
Santiago is from Mexico,

164
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:20,066
and he invites to be with him

165
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,532
and his family in their house.

166
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:23,799
And I'm seeing this whole new culture.

167
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,366
This amazing culture that

168
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:26,199
it doesn’t matter

169
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,199
how much I would have read,

170
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,099
I wouldn’t have been able

171
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,599
to really empathize with. And then,

172
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,032
the roommate who lives in front of me

173
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:33,799
in the dorms is from Uganda.

174
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,599
And he got a laptop

175
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,299
when he was younger

176
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,432
and he self-taught himself

177
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:37,932
how to program.

178
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:39,132
And he got to Stanford.

179
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:40,032
And he's talking about these

180
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,566
atrocities that are happening.

181
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,099
And hearing it from a primary source,

182
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,066
and one of my goals is now to go

183
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:47,266
and visit him and live with his family

184
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:47,899
in Uganda.

185
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,266
Because of what you're saying

186
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:50,732
that this human connection

187
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,432
and being there,

188
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:53,532
not just reading about it

189
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:54,899
as a second hand source,

190
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,466
but being there is remarkable.

191
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:57,866
Anat, skipping away

192
00:06:57,867 --> 00:06:59,432
to Innovation Endeavors

193
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:00,799
because we only have 20 minutes.

194
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,699
It's impossible. I know. I know.

195
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,532
I should have done it a bigger -

196
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:04,566
Why couldn’t I have called it

197
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:05,566
a 30-minute leaders?

198
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:07,866
I don’t know why.

199
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:09,399
Innovation Endeavors.

200
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,766
Tell me a little bit about that

201
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:11,666
and what you did over there.

202
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:12,899
Yeah. So, first of all

203
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,266
Innovation Endeavors is

204
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,032
I agree with you

205
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,132
it's one of the most incredible

206
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:17,332
venture capital firms

207
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,166
who are out there to date.

208
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:20,099
Was originally started as a fund

209
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,199
that was solely backed by Eric Schmidt

210
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,766
from Google and was the founding partner

211
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:24,466
was Dror Berman

212
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:25,466
who's a very good friend of mine.

213
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:26,732
An amazing guy.

214
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:29,166
And the fund has grown significantly.

215
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:31,799
There’s a lot of other investors today.

216
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,732
And really, it is an example of

217
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,066
how you can use capital

218
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:38,399
to target big massive problems.

219
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,032
Massive problems.

220
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:41,599
So, actually Innovation never says

221
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,799
"We only tackle massive problems

222
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,599
Are you moving the needle?

223
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,032
If not, maybe we're not

224
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,532
the right partner for you"

225
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:49,132
That's right.

226
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,666
Massive problems that honestly

227
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,666
have a positive impact on the world.

228
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:53,732
So, not to confuse this with

229
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:55,566
social impact but really looking

230
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:57,532
at the places where you can

231
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,899
leverage technology to really shift

232
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,966
the game in either old markets

233
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:02,832
or emerging markets

234
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,199
in ways that contribute

235
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,666
to solving significant things in the world.

236
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:08,466
And for me you know,

237
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:11,266
it was an incredible journey to be able

238
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:12,099
to be part of that.

239
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,532
So you know, break this down for me

240
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:15,532
a little bit more because you know,

241
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:17,732
as an entrepreneur and as somebody

242
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,066
who gets excited so much

243
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:19,932
about this world,

244
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,399
it gets confusing sometimes.

245
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,366
It gets confusing because a lot of people

246
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:24,866
love to say that they're gonna make

247
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:25,732
an impact.

248
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:28,032
Some of them mean social impact.

249
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:29,332
Some of them global impact.

250
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,232
Financial impact.

251
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:32,532
What are the differences

252
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,966
and how has Innovation Endeavors

253
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:37,699
placed itself as the nucleus

254
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,832
of changing the world?

255
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,266
Look, I mean you can measure impact

256
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:43,199
in many different ways.

257
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,566
By the way, even if ...

258
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,499
you look at the individual impact

259
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,766
you look at a human scale

260
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:50,099
how many human lives have we impacted

261
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,166
You look at economic job creation

262
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:53,266
or economic impact.

263
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:54,599
You look at solutions

264
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,932
to health problems like disease,

265
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:58,466
or the environment and so on.

266
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:01,399
And I think for a venture capital firm

267
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,199
like Innovation Endeavors,

268
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,866
you look for that intersection

269
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:05,032
where, and this is not about

270
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:07,099
a double bottom line or triple,

271
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,899
but it is about that intersection

272
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,132
where deep tech can significantly

273
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,132
shift the way things are done

274
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:16,932
in a way that also generates returns

275
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:20,632
but that can really create solutions

276
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,332
and create a better world.

277
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,666
You know, the question of

278
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:24,899
how you think about that?

279
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,266
It really depends.

280
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,499
At the end of the day -

281
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,832
That's the innovation side of it.

282
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,466
What?

283
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:33,032
That's the innovation side of it.

284
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:35,166
Yes. And what you believe

285
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:36,432
are models for change.

286
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:37,499
You know I've talked over the years,

287
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,966
and myself I've transitioned from

288
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:40,466
non-profit to public sector.

289
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:41,399
Worked in the public sector.

290
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,932
I've worked in VC.

291
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:44,332
I'm now an entrepreneur.

292
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,499
You know, there are very different

293
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,132
models of impact.

294
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:49,432
But I think it’s the choice,

295
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:50,666
you make choices about

296
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:51,966
what are the problems you're trying

297
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,399
to solve, who are the people

298
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,499
you are trying to influence,

299
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,699
what kind of teams you build

300
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,532
and cultures you build,

301
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:58,599
and all of that is part of what you can

302
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,299
think about as impact.

303
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:48,732
Did I lose you again?

304
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:50,566
And so, at the end

305
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,666
the question yields itself.

306
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:55,066
You can’t be an expert on everything.

307
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:56,199
You're a small team.

308
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,932
Innovation Endeavors is a small team.

309
00:10:57,933 --> 00:11:00,299
And when you're dealing with you know these,

310
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,799
with the most difficult problems

311
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,899
in the world to solve, you kind of need

312
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,732
to be an expert on them to solve them.

313
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,332
So how do you even go about

314
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,032
being a partner in this? A capital partner

315
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:12,532
but also you know sitting on these,

316
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:13,999
the Boards of these companies,

317
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,699
or even just understanding whether

318
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,132
this is a viable business that could

319
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:18,832
actually reach that impact.

320
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,866
Yeah, I mean again.

321
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:22,566
Although, and I have to say

322
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:23,666
you know I'm no longer a partner

323
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,399
I'm now on the other side,

324
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,566
but I can speak from the experience

325
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:27,366
when I was there.

326
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,299
And I'm also super lucky

327
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,332
because Innovation Endeavors

328
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,432
invested in my company,

329
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:32,666
is on my board so I get to stay very

330
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:34,932
Yes yes and I can't wait to go ... it, yep.

331
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:36,399
Yes and I love so much.

332
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,932
But just kind of my perspective.

333
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:39,599
When I was more on the VC side,

334
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,199
as part of what I loved was this challenge

335
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,299
that every minute of the day

336
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,366
you're learning a new space.

337
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,499
At the same time there's definitely

338
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,066
verticals that you start to build thesisis

339
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:50,366
around and you understand

340
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:53,566
and kind of deep dive in to. In addition,

341
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:56,099
it's really about building networks again

342
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,732
of experts around you.

343
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:59,232
Whether its founders or other people

344
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:00,899
that you can learn from quickly.

345
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,732
It's learning how do you understand

346
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:04,332
the things as quickly as possible

347
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,166
and are able to target the main risk

348
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:07,899
and have a thesis about

349
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,399
whether this risk can be kind of

350
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,399
de-risk by this team. This team

351
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,666
and this company is the right team

352
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,132
to de-risk if the opportunity is

353
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,266
big enough. I would say

354
00:12:16,267 --> 00:12:17,466
third is experience

355
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:19,399
over time as a VC. You know,

356
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,832
VCs like to say

357
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,066
it's a mix of an art and a science.

358
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:22,999
There's something to it.

359
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,166
You know each person develops

360
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:26,166
their intuitive and instinct.

361
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:27,232
Some of it gets a little bit

362
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:29,466
on the bias side. But at the same time,

363
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:30,899
you also develop certain approaches,

364
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,566
frameworks, questions that really help you

365
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:36,399
asses those things pretty analytically.

366
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,332
No no I love it. That's just incredible.

367
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,399
And Anat, I hope I'll have

368
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,132
enough time for this

369
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:41,799
but now you're actually on

370
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,766
maybe one of the most exciting

371
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:45,266
parts of the journey

372
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:46,566
being on the entrepreneur side.

373
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,999
Co-founding a company,

374
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,099
not just another company

375
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,932
but a needle moving company

376
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:53,399
that Innovation Endeavors

377
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,466
and Khosla ventures, and Marc Benioff,

378
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:57,832
Benioff is also a part of.

379
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,999
Please, what is Ukko?

380
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,332
What is that name actually?

381
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,399
Everyone ask. So Ukko,

382
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,766
it's actually Ukko.

383
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:08,699
it's the Finnish from Finland.

384
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,932
It's the God of harvesting rains

385
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:12,999
of the Finnish mythology.

386
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,199
And we wanted a name

387
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,266
that is not overly bio,

388
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:17,566
is connected to what we do,

389
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:18,566
which I'll explain in a sec,

390
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:19,599
and also had some kind of

391
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,866
personal connection. I grew up

392
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:23,232
going to Finland in the summers.

393
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:26,066
I have a really close relationship

394
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:27,599
with that country. So, Ukko

395
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,366
we're an early stage bio-tech company

396
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:30,999
with focus on solving food allergy

397
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,132
and sensitivities.

398
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:33,632
So, things like gluten sensitivities,

399
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,499
and also peanut allergy,

400
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,099
and other food allergies. And we go about it -

401
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,866
And now did

402
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:39,799
you really just say that you're working

403
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,099
to solve food allergies

404
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,299
like gluten sensitivities

405
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,432
and peanuts sensitivity?

406
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:46,532
That's right.

407
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:47,699
I mean, these are like that's huge.

408
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,332
Like you know, some people say,

409
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,966
"I wanna sell more ads.

410
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:52,799
I want to have people

411
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,166
download my app on the app store"

412
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,866
You're solving food, things that are

413
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:57,966
killing people around the world.

414
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,466
That's right. And I have to say,

415
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:00,699
you know for me going back

416
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,766
to Innovation Endeavors,

417
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:03,532
definitely you know something

418
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:04,832
that's super close to my heart.

419
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,932
I don't think I would have ever left

420
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:09,066
unless it was for something like this.

421
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:10,999
And as I said, ...

422
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,166
Yes. So, food allergy.

423
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:14,432
You know I don’t remember this growing up,

424
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:15,632
and I grow up like I'm an

425
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:17,532
in-between person. I grew up in Israel

426
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:19,366
and the US, I don’t remember

427
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:21,232
having allergies around me.

428
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:22,966
Right. People didn't really talk

429
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:23,699
about them even.

430
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,166
And it just wasn’t as prevalent.

431
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,732
So, the data’s astounding.

432
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:29,499
There’s been like

433
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,132
a 50% rise in kids with food allergies

434
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:32,166
in the past decade alone.

435
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:34,132
We work with the best best doctors

436
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:35,866
literally in the world. And I'll also tell you

437
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:38,066
that it's not clear why this is happening.

438
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:39,266
There are certain explanations

439
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:40,366
but none of them are,

440
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:42,666
there isn’t one resounding scientifically

441
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:44,299
backed explanation.

442
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,666
So, yes, we are targeting,

443
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:49,166
we basically design proteins that are

444
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:50,399
totally safe but maintain all the

445
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,232
other qualities and we apply them

446
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:53,266
in the food world

447
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,332
and the therapeutics world.

448
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,532
So, both creating new types of foods

449
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:57,332
and also drugs.

450
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,832
So, what is the vision for this?

451
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,132
You're saying you're literally creating

452
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,766
these different sources of proteins that are

453
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,966
gonna be used in creating foods

454
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:06,132
that we consume so that somebody

455
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:07,766
who now couldn’t eat a cake

456
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,099
because of their gluten sensitivity,

457
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,099
they'll be able to eat that same cake

458
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,966
because the protein structure is different?

459
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:15,399
Yeah. What's your favorite bakery

460
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,899
there in Israel that you miss the most?

461
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,699
Or like in San Francisco California?

462
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,966
I'm a simple guy.

463
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:24,132
I go for like Arcaffe for lunch there.

464
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,932
Okay. So, let's go Tartine

465
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:28,432
in San Francisco, okay.

466
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:30,566
So, imagine being able to walk into Tartine

467
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,266
in San Francisco and being able

468
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:33,832
to eat anything that you want there.

469
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:34,932
It would be safe for anyone with

470
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:35,899
Celiac or

471
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,566
gluten sensitivity

472
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:39,132
Today for people with gluten sensitivities

473
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:40,866
you know really the only thing you can do is

474
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:43,132
avoid the food by eating gluten free.

475
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:46,432
Gluten free is that, not very tasty.

476
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:48,999
Actually, the main issue's their often

477
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,366
very unhealthy because you have to add

478
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,166
a lot of substitutes to compensate

479
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:54,532
for the fact that there is no gluten.

480
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,799
So, yes. For example, with gluten,

481
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,966
our gluten proteins are completely safe

482
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:00,232
but maintain all the other qualities

483
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:01,332
so you have that amazing breads,

484
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,599
pastas, pizza doughs that anyone

485
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,599
in the world could eat

486
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,599
would be safe for everyone.

487
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,099
And on the food allergy side,

488
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,532
we're actually developing a drug

489
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:11,299
that would be a potential cure.

490
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,699
Wow. Okay so the completely

491
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,199
yet intertwined things.

492
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,599
Both of them world changing.

493
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,899
And at the end, I guess

494
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,432
the biggest challenge of it would be

495
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:26,066
to make this economically viable.

496
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:29,566
So, that the producing gluten free pasta

497
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:30,932
that is just as tasty as the same.

498
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:32,632
I'm not even talking about the challenges

499
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:34,299
of getting an FDA approval for a cure

500
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,499
and that sort of thing.

501
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,066
So, is this really the biggest challenge?

502
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,999
Or what are you finding now

503
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,832
as you're going through this

504
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,232
entrepreneurship path?

505
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:46,799
I mean, the entrepreneurship path

506
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,099
has so many challenges.

507
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,666
You know, but that question of

508
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:50,799
like what keeps you up at night?

509
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,332
On most regular nights

510
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,432
not during pandemics and you know

511
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:55,499
really civil unrest that

512
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,499
is so concerning and saddening.

513
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,332
But I would say,

514
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,932
you know definitely making sure

515
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,499
that we have a good go to market.

516
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,099
We are a bio tech company.

517
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,399
Biology is a tough partner in the route

518
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,832
because you can’t control it

519
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,066
sometimes as much as,

520
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:12,966
It's not like if you hack all night

521
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:14,766
or code all night you can get it out

522
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,266
and kind of you know launch and iterate.

523
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:18,632
Often it takes time,

524
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:20,366
experiments take time and so on.

525
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:24,232
So, for us making sure that we,

526
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:25,799
the minute that our product

527
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,632
gets out there

528
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,732
it's truly safe and wonderful

529
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,432
and provides a solution for

530
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,632
these communities that’s critical.

531
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,266
We're actually producing our gluten

532
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:35,432
through other crops

533
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:37,932
so it'll end up being, cost

534
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:41,299
a very price you know, competitive.

535
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,232
That's just incredible.

536
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:46,999
Anat, give me a few insights on this path

537
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,366
that you are going on as an entrepreneur.

538
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,299
So really the things that do

539
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:49,966
keep you up at night.

540
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:51,566
And I mean, you're a mother,

541
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:52,532
you have different responsibilities.

542
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:55,899
You did the VC job.

543
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,999
A lot of people are comparing

544
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,766
it, that you're having a lot of the fun

545
00:17:58,767 --> 00:17:59,766
that an entrepreneur might have

546
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:00,966
but you still get to do your

547
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:02,499
nine to five job and go have dinner

548
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,299
with the kids every day and all.

549
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:10,166
Maybe not. Well Innovation Endeavors ...

550
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,666
But now you're committed to this

551
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:13,666
you know seven to nine-year journey

552
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:16,532
at least of running this company.

553
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:19,699
And how was this decision?

554
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,899
And how did it actually work out?

555
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,332
For me, first of all it was hard

556
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,399
cause I left something I loved

557
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,332
and I'm again lucky to have maintained

558
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,432
it also in my life.

559
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:30,366
But I'm also an operator.

560
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:32,266
There's a big difference in your

561
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:33,766
daily experiences you see as you

562
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:34,699
may experience and kind of the

563
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,966
daily experience on the operating side.

564
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:39,632
I love the operation.

565
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:41,766
I especially love the zero to something.

566
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:43,532
Those are my favorite things

567
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:44,966
to kind of get involved in.

568
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:47,399
So you know, it’s very different

569
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,666
as far as you definitely dive deep

570
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:51,932
versus in a VC you go wide. Right?

571
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:53,366
Like as I said, every two hours

572
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:55,032
you may deal ... company.

573
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,666
You get the really macro view of the world

574
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,066
whereas for me now

575
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:01,666
I'm deep deep diving into our world.

576
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,566
So that's one difference.

577
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:05,566
And you know you have to,

578
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:08,932
there's the multitasking is a mess.

579
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:11,732
At MIT where I went you know there’s a,

580
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,232
they'll say that freshman year is like

581
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:14,132
drinking from the fire hose.

582
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:15,832
So, I think especially being a CEO,

583
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:16,999
it’s like drinking from I don’t know,

584
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,332
50 firehoses going on at once.

585
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,399
Every minute of the day

586
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,532
I'm really trying to figure out

587
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:23,766
am I prioritizing the right thing?

588
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:25,466
Is this really what I should be working on

589
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:26,732
because it’s all the time

590
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,299
you cannot get everything done.

591
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,366
And when you add on to that small kids,

592
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:31,499
that price only become you know

593
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,232
that struggle only becomes more difficult

594
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:35,366
or a bigger challenge.

595
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:37,632
Amazing. Anat, I can’t believe

596
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:38,766
our time is almost over.

597
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:39,632
But I have two more questions.

598
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:42,932
First of all, this is a very selfish question

599
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,632
because I now have you

600
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:48,299
giving me your attention and I'm on my own

601
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,566
entrepreneurship path.

602
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:52,299
From the idea to the amazing unit

603
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,199
that I really enjoyed being in.

604
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,632
To now at Stanford and

605
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:56,199
I'm exploring these different paths

606
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,966
from venture capital to technology to

607
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,466
entrepreneurship. And I imagine that

608
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:02,832
there’s a lot of like minded people

609
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,599
that are going through these similar

610
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,599
dilemmas of where do we prioritize?

611
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,099
And you know, careers are no longer linear.

612
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,232
And I take so much inspiration

613
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:11,566
from the path that you chose

614
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:14,632
and from a lot of your friends that chose.

615
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:17,299
And what would be your

616
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,299
best recommendation

617
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,399
or recommendations you would give

618
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,999
to somebody like me who's really

619
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,466
just starting out their path

620
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:23,899
and has much much to learn

621
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,532
and many ways to go?

622
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:27,266
Yeah. I would say first of all I think

623
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,332
I'm definitely an example

624
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,399
of connecting the dots and

625
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,666
I'm still connecting it. You know,

626
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:32,399
my background's very very

627
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,666
interdisciplinary and really went from

628
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,399
one place to another.

629
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,899
And I think one of things I learn,

630
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,232
a few things I've learned,

631
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:40,299
one is don't stay in your head too long.

632
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,832
There's a limit to how much you can plan.

633
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,232
A lot happens by doing.

634
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:45,432
You discover a lot of new things

635
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:46,499
about your passions,

636
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,799
about what you really connect to,

637
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,866
what you care about

638
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:49,832
by getting out there and

639
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,832
starting to do things.

640
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,832
You can't plan the path.

641
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:53,966
It's never gonna be the way

642
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:55,232
you planned it exactly.

643
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:56,166
You sometimes have to jump

644
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,599
and go and just keeps thinking

645
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,566
how it leads you forward.

646
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:01,432
People tend, especially when

647
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:01,999
they're in school,

648
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,632
to kind of really try to figure out,

649
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:05,032
consult with a million people

650
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:06,466
and you get locked in sometimes.

651
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:08,099
And sometimes you just have to

652
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,332
take the risk and move forward

653
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,732
and know that you're not just

654
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:11,399
picking one path.

655
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,732
It'll diverge along the way

656
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:14,166
to other things as well.

657
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:16,532
Totally. Okay. And very very last

658
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:19,966
I half warned about this ahead of time.

659
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:23,599
But still, I want to know one, two

660
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,466
maybe three words that you would

661
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:28,666
consider yourself as or maybe your kids

662
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:29,966
would consider you as.

663
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:31,099
Or if I would ask Dror,

664
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,032
or your co-founder at Ukko,

665
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:36,432
who is Anat? What drives you?

666
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:38,066
What are the key thing

667
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:39,199
that keeps you up?

668
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,332
I don’t if it’s the key thing

669
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,866
that keeps me up. But I'd say, yeah.

670
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:44,199
When you told me you may ask this,

671
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,766
the reason is, first, I would say

672
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:47,066
I'm still figuring that out.

673
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:49,032
I realize at some point in my life that.

674
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:52,899
That's the best answer I ever got. Anat.

675
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,766
You know, a long time ago

676
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:56,999
I kept looking for definitions

677
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,832
and actually realized I don’t want that.

678
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,066
It's a dynamic question.

679
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:03,499
So, I don’t have one answer.

680
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,632
I can also say that I realize

681
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:07,699
I'm really an in between. I'm an in between

682
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,399
person in so many things.

683
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,032
I'm Israeli but I'm also American.

684
00:22:11,033 --> 00:22:12,966
You know I'm an entrepreneur.

685
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:15,866
I'm a mom. And that's actually a strength.

686
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,799
It's also a struggle because you have to

687
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,666
balance and figure out

688
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:20,032
and feel okay in uncertainty

689
00:22:20,033 --> 00:22:21,566
and your identity and so on

690
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:24,132
So I don’t know.

691
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:25,066
Hopefully that gives you

692
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:26,532
a little bit of what you wanted.

693
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:28,699
I love it. Anat, toda raba.

694
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,332
Thank you so much. Best of luck.

695
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:34,932
And just keep inspiring me and others

696
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:35,432
Please.

697
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:37,999
Thanks.

698
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,166
Take care.

699
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:47,800
All right. Bye.
