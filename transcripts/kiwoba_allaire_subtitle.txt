1 All right. Kiwoba Allaire, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? I'm very excited to be here. Thank you for having me. Quite honored. This is going to be a wonderful journey that you'll take me through over these next 20 minutes. I'm excited to hear about your personal journey. I'm very excited to hear about the organization that you've founded. And just the whole process of both being a tech executive but also owning this organization and being so passionate about empowering the missions that you're off to. So, I don't want to give too much away. Please take it away. GIRL STEM STARS, tell me about this. Oh, sure. Thank you so much again for having me. My name is Kiwoba Allaire. I am the CEO and founder of GIRL STEM STARS. We advance girls of color from underrepresented communities in STEM, science, technology, engineering and math. A lot of people ask me, "Why did you start GIRL STEM STARS?" The whole entrepreneurial story. And it's actually very organic. I started doing this type of work at a tech company years ago where I was bringing in girls of color every Wednesday. We had about a busload of 50 girls that would come in and each department in the tech company would teach the girls something and then we'd bus them back. From there, I noticed that we didn't have a lot of black girls. We had Latina, we had Pan-Asian, we had a lot of girls, but I maybe had one or two black girls. And so, as things happen, I wound up having a near-death experience. And in 2013 I was supposed to have a routine surgery that actually went sideways. I wound up septic all over my body. It particularly hit my heart, my lungs, my kidneys and what else, my heart, my lungs, my kidneys and something else. But at the end of the day, I was in a coma for three weeks. And it's interesting, my doctors tell me that, Three weeks? Yes. Yes. So, when I came out of that coma, I had no idea what happened. I thought I got hit by a car. I had no idea what happened. And my family had to explain to me that I was very sick and that I nearly died. My doctor said I was five minutes from death three times. And long story short, it was a long recovery. But my Auntie Claudia came to my recovery bed and she said, "Girl, do you realize that God sent his boring and ministering angels to fight for you and to keep you?" And it's not just to continue working at that tech company, you have a greater purpose on your life." And I realized, let me pray about this, let me think about this. But at the end of the day, I started to think what bugs me, what do am I not happy about in this world. And I remember I used to complain and whine to recruiters and HR people saying, "Hey, Susie, with the blond hair and blue eyes, hire more people that look like me." Because I was the only person that looked like me at most tech companies that I worked at. I didn't get to see anybody that look like myself on a daily basis. And that can tend to bug me after a while. So, yeah, I realized, okay, stop whining and complaining, let's be the change that I wanted to see. Wait, before we get to this change, because I don't get to meet many people who have gone through such an extraordinary experience, a horrible experience but extraordinary nevertheless, of being in a coma for three weeks, waking up. Give me a little bit of context as to, and paint me a picture of what's happening there. So, you wake up, you're in the tech world, there are things that bother you and you're going to have all this passion and ambition to change those things. But what do you feel? Are you confused? Do you understand what was happening? Who was next to you? Paint me that picture because I think it's fascinating. So, I'm really blessed. My husband, when I came out of it the nurses told me, "Your husband was like a lion at the front of your bed." I'm like, "My husband?" Because he's actually usually quite mild mannered. And I was very surprised that they said he was really fighting for me. I mean, of course, I knew he'd fight for me, but not in the physical way that they had expressed. And when he, I guess, he asked for permission to put speakers in the ICU so that he could play my favorite music, which is bossa nova,  Sergio Mendez. And so, when during the coma I could hear the music, which is interesting. People say, "Can you hear anything during the coma?" Yes, you can. At least I did. I could hear the music. Really? You remember hearing the music? I knew I was in a safe place because it's my music. Nobody else that I know listens to that music. So, when I heard that music, I knew that I was in a safe place. But coming out of the coma, it's like coming out of a cloud. And I won't get into, like, what I thought happened in there. But it's like coming out of a big puffy cloud and everything's kind of muted but it's starting to come, everything's starting to come awake. And then you hear people talking and people are encouraging you. I remember hearing a nurse telling me, "Come on, you can't die." "You have a lot to live for." I remember her rubbing my arm. I remember her rubbing my arm. I could tell the people that came into the room that cared about me. I knew that if my family was there, I didn't know who they were, but I just felt a warm entity that I knew I was safe and that person cared about me as opposed to the brush of a white jacket. You hear the clicking of the board where your medical stuff is on and then click it goes back down and they're gone. It was like a cold breeze that went through, right? So, coming out of that, I had no idea what happened. What I was told is I came out of the surgery and I was fine. I went home. Doctor said, "You're up in two weeks." And inevitably I wasn't. And I passed out in our home. So, my husband raced me to the emergency room and they told him that my white blood cell count was off the charts and to call family. And so, he called all of the family. I do remember hearing murmurs of them talking, saying they love me, that they're praying for me, but I don't remember anything after that. Supposedly, I was in recovery for two weeks after they did another surgery and I just started to crash. I guess that what they said, I was talking to a nurse and then all of a sudden the blue light goes on and I crashed and they had to revive me. And they called my husband and said, "We've induced your wife into a coma so that she doesn't die and we don't know what's wrong with her." So, at that point, my husband had to call the CEO of the tech company I was working with and say, "Yeah, I don't think Kiwoba was coming back." And interestingly enough, that CEO happened to know people on the board of the hospital that I was at. And my husband, he said, "Let me call some people." And he wound up helping out. And my husband said there was a guy from Stanford in the room, there was four heads of surgeries and head of this Department of Pulmonary. And after a while, they finally figured out what was wrong with me and proceeded to, he said, like, 10 people showed up in the room and they all seemed to know what was going on now. And they knew what to do to get me better. But he was told it was still a 50-50 chance that I would survive. Wow. Right. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. So, you come out of this crazy experience. And you're taking the passion that you had before, now, it sounds like with a deeper purpose and meaning to what you can and should be doing with your time. And while you were doing extraordinary things in your job and you still are you chose to now devote another portion of your time to this new project. Tell me about GIRL STEM STARS. So, as I mentioned, I was in my recovery bed when I came to that enlightenment of, okay, stop whining and complaining, be the change that you wanted to see. And so, I literally called up, I picked up the phone from my recovery bed, and I called LegalZoom and said, "I want to start a non-profit that advances black girls and girls of color from underserved communities in STEM." And I started to roll out from there, started doing the 501(c)3. But I found that I came to, like I was crawling up a hill but I just got stuck. And I was talking to one of my friends who's on the Council of East Palo Alto and he's like, "How are you doing?" And I burst into tears and he's like, "What's going on?" And I said, "I've been trying to do this 501(c)3." And he goes, "Girl, you trying to do a 501(c)3 while you're in recovery in bed?" He says, "What are you crazy?" So, he says, "You need to speak up." And that was one enlightment right there. Don't carry it all yourself, you need help. Every leader needs help. And so, he put out the word and found a lawyer that was interested in the work that we were doing. And I actually crawled out of my recovery bed to go meet him. And he's like, "What are you doing here?" "I thought we were going to be on the phone?" I'm like, "Anybody who wants to help me with this project, I want to see you face to face." And at the end of the day he took the whole project from me, paid for it and worked with the IRS to do the 501(c)3. So, I mean, I'm a believer. So, this is where I say, "Look how God works in my life." Right? And then we got a lot of recognition and participation, a lot of volunteers. I gathered all the girls and we started doing events at tech companies. So, we would take a group of girls, say one hundred girls over to Google and they would have a whole day. I know the parents were grateful that they get to drop off their kid at 7:30 in the morning. We feed them breakfast, we give them goodie bags, t-shirts, you name it, and then we are teaching them. We expose them to amazing mentors like black women astronauts and the VP of YouTube who is a black woman. The girls freaked out, they're like, "You're the boss of Youtube?" And she's like, "Yes, I am." And they're like, "Oh, I want to be like her." Boom, we automatically have that child's attention. And that girl wants to be, because I usually ask them, "Who do you want to be when you grow up?" They're like, "Oh, I want to be like Beyonce." And, "Oh, I want to be a veterinarian so I could take care of puppies." "Oh, I wanna be a dancer." But at the end of the day, when they get to meet a woman like this, the vice president of YouTube, which they all relate to, or they get to meet a black female rocket scientist from NASA who has braids just like them. I remember she came up and she said, "Guess how much I make?" And they're like, "I don't know, $5,000, $10,000." She goes, "I make over $200,000." They're like, "What?" "Okay, I want to be like you." Automatically, after hearing what this woman does and how much she makes, they're instantly attracted to, even the fame of it. She's a new she hero for them, a new STEM hero for them. STEM hero, I like that. Yes. Yes. There's lots of instances where we take a busload of girls to NASA and they get to hang out with the Black Woman Resource Group there and eat lunch with them, go sit by their side, and see what they do on a daily basis. It blows the girls mind. Amazing. Absolutely. Wow. So, talk to me a little bit about this impact, because first of all, I'd like to understand the context of the problem a little bit bigger, and through that also the opportunity for impact. So, I'm also coming in from outside of the country. And obviously, 2020 has brought up a lot of different adversities. One thing that it has clearly brought up is the issue of minorities within the United States and the fight for equality and for diversification everywhere. Obviously, with the work that you're doing with the GIRL STEM STARS is incredible. And I'm sure that it's impacted so many lives of young women. Talk to me a little bit about this greater scope. So, STEM, girls and minorities, what is happening today and where are you aiming for? So, it's interesting. You don't see girls really interested in math and science and technology, but when we bring them into a tech company or at NASA, but also now that we're, because of covid, we're doing virtual learning, the fact that they get to see a woman on the screen, ask her questions: how did you get there; what did you do; that mentor will show pictures of themselves as the little girl so the girls can resonate with them. Like, okay, she was like me at one point. This is where I believe all educators need to be starting very very young by getting girls interested in STEM. And it's super easy to do it in a fun way where the girls are learning and they're excited about it. And they see people, they see women that they want to emulate, that they want to be like. And then at this point in the game you can see the ambition where, again, like the black's rocket scientists from NASA, they have that, "If I can see it, I can be it." And this is what we need more of for minorities to just be exposed to more STEM and to expose them to more STEM heroes. And it's a global thing. I want to take GIRL STEM STARS global. My first step is to take it to Africa. Right now what I do is the videos that you see online of like the girls visiting Google and Microsoft and such. I share them with my counterparts in Africa and that enables those girls out there to be able to see, wow. I have my video guy, I'm like, "Make it like you're walking in and you're in it." Like you're in the experience. So that the girls in Africa can really feel like this is what this Google looks like; this is what NASA looks like; this is what a black rocket scientist looks like. There's some STEM heroes. So, what has been the impact of GIRL STEM STARS so far? How many girls have gone through the program? And what are you aiming to go to in terms of the scale? Right. We have touched over a thousand girls. A thousand? Wow. Yes, since inception, over a thousand girls in the Bay Area and further. I actually did a STEM camp virtually for girls in Malaysia. So, a friend of mine was going out there to do an educational program and they said, "Would you mind doing GIRL STEM STARS in Malaysia?" I'm like, "Sure." It was amazing to see all the girls with their headgear and the little GIRL STEM STARS teacher and they're like, "Hey." So, now that we're in this virtual world, the world is my oyster. When you think about it that I can take GIRL STEM STARS anywhere. And that's interesting. So, you were saying that with the acceleration of the virtual collaboration interaction due to covid, now, I mean, because you could have done this before. You could have said, Okay. I'm going to focus on primarily virtual gatherings rather than allocate a lot of time and resources to going physically. And it actually makes a lot of sense that probably for every field trip that's organized, you could probably organize five gatherings virtually for the same Kiwoba time, for the same resources. So it's really fascinating. And so, now you're planning on taking this global, allowing interaction, I'm guessing, also from participants around the world. And what else needs to happen in order to level the playing field or provide not an opportunity for them to study STEM, because I'm guessing that a lot of times they do, but to get their minds curious about it and to make it socially acceptable for also minorities, black girls that you're targeting to help them get start in the process? More awareness needs to be brought up in media. Because kids are always in media, social media, and we need more STEM heroes and we need stem to look cool and fun. Right now, it's for the nerdy group and it's not, really. Right. I mean, I show videos of my husband and I scuba diving and we're kissing underwater and the girls are like, "Oh, that looks like so much fun." And I'm like, "Do you realize how much STEM is on my back?" "Do you realize how many math and science classes I had to take before they let me jump off that boat?" And then this is where they're like, "Oh, STEM can be fun too." I try to teach the girls that STEM is in every aspect of their lives. It's in your phone. It's in everything that you do. It's in the computer. It's in everything. And this is where they want to be, we need them to be curious about every subject: math, science, technology, engineering. And also we need companies to invest in our youth. They keep complaining, "Oh, well, the pipeline is dry." No, it's not. You need to start investing in communities, invest in teaching, also invest in widening their scope of recruiting so that they're not just looking at the high profile HBCUs but also city colleges and state colleges. They want the top four Ivy. Come on, that's not who runs the world. All right. If we want to be able to be successful with our technology moving forward, we need to include more minorities. Otherwise globally, we will not be able to interact. Globally, our technology will not work if we don't invite minorities to have a seat at the table. So, what we're doing at Girl STEM STAR is we're starting them as early as seven years old to 18 years old. And so, this is where we're building the future leaders, the future entrepreneurs, the future decision makers, the future business owners. And this is where we'll see change. That's just wonderful. And obviously, as this is a nonprofit, if anybody happens to listen to this and is also passionate about this cause and would like to contribute, I'm sure that I can make an introduction and send of the contact for GIRL STEM STARS. But before we leave, Kiwoba, I have to ask the most important question. Three words that you would use to describe yourself. Yes. And thank you for the plug on donations, www.girlstemstars.org you can make a donation there. Three words about me. One, I'm faithful. I am a believer, and I'm truly grateful that God has put this calling for GIRL STEM STARS on my life. And it's amazing. It changed my life. It changes the life of every person who ever comes and volunteers with these girls. They're like, Oh my gosh, I didn't realize it was so easy to just come and roll up my sleeves, meet these girls, and then at the end of an eight hour day, or if it's just a couple of hours on a virtual, the girls are so fun and they see the little light bulbs going of in the girls minds. They're like, so move going. "I want to do that again." So, we're not just touching the girls, but we're also touching employees at different companies. We're touching executives. And so, it's a great calling. It needs to happen right now. Right now. This is a very rich environment for the world to be able to start making a difference on their own. So, like, this was my situation where I don't see black people on a daily basis in Silicon Valley. But what is important to somebody else? What makes you tick? What's important to you? Or what bugs you? I'm asking you. Right. Well, for me, it's the dissemination of information. There are so many people like you that are so influential and have so many incredible experiences that without a medium to disseminate this information, the majority of the population will not be able to hear it. And especially the stories that I try to cover here, these are not TechCrunch or Crunchbase stories. These are more about the journeys. And the reason the passion that you're starting GIRL STEM STARS in this sort of epiphany that you had and this passion that you've acquired over the years and the trigger from that coma, that's exactly the things that I'd like to share. Right. So, you're really walking out your, and that's my next word is passion. You're really walking out your passion. When I've been on stage before as a motivational speaker, I ask some of the people in the front row, "So, what are you interested in?" "What bugs you?" And one woman is like, "I love the beach." I'm like, "Well, get your friends together and go clean it up." She's like, "Oh, my gosh, it's that eas?." I'm like, "Yes." Find a purpose in your life other than just the typical job that you do on a daily basis. It's as simple as, okay, the next woman, "Okay, what are you interested in?" "Well, I love animals." "I love dogs." Well then go take care of some dogs. Go to a shelter, bring your friend, get a Facebook group going, do something and you'll feel better as a human being than just crunching at your daily job when you have a purpose, right? And it's so easy. Just think about what am I interested in, what I don't like in this world, and then be the change you want to see and get out there, grab your friends and do it. It's that simple. And I don't think everybody needs a God epiphany and have to nearly die to be able to come to where I've gotten to. I'm not telling people you can skip all that, I'm just telling you it's this easy, right? It's this easy. And then my next one is driven. I'm faithful, I'm passionate, and I'm driven as you heard from my stories. I'm trying to start a nonprofit from my recovery bed. 100%. Very driven. 100%. Kiwoba, thank you very much for the time and for the inspiration. This was just eye opening and just wonderful. Thank you very very much. Yes. It's been an honor to be here. Thank you so much for showcasing GIRL STEM STARS today and the work that we're doing. God bless you. I appreciate it. Take care. Bye.
