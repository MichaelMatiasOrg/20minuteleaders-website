1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,400
How can we create online programs

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,920
that maybe aren't for full degrees

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,040
but there's still a skills base,

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,640
potentially certifications

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,600
that have the branding

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,080
that are recognized by employers.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,760
There needs to be a shift

8
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,800
on the employer side

9
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,500
to accept these new types of trainings.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,360
Tess Manning, thank you so much

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,800
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Good morning to you.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,680
Good evening to me.

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,160
How are you?

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,200
Thanks, Michael. I'm doing well.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,600
Great to be here.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,760
Appreciate the invitation.

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,960
I'm very, very happy that you're here

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,040
because we're going to talk about

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,400
one of my favorite markets and industries

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,680
that unfortunately,

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,080
I don't know nearly enough

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,760
as much as I should,

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,600
which is the education space.

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,560
And you have a really

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,440
fascinating trajectory

27
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,200
all the way from working at a company

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,680
like Pluralsight, which I have used

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,880
and many of my friends use

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,680
all the way to now

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,360
being a principal at the GSV Ventures

32
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,000
and really focusing

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,120
on the education sector more deeply.

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,840
But in between,

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,600
there were some other

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,680
really incredible things.

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,760
Like doing an MBA at Stanford,

38
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,680
helping teach classes at Stanford.

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,560
And we have to get started

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,640
with your fun fact,

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,200
which is the fact that, you know,

42
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,280
your a dancer at heart

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,160
and you actually taught some hip hop

44
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,040
and dance to some people at Stanford

45
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,600
and in the VC space.

46
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,074
That's right.

47
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:47,600
So, while I was at GSV,

48
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:50,520
I was teaching, a what turned into

49
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,640
a weekly hip hop dance class

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,160
with one of my classmates

51
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,360
to all of our classmates

52
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,520
starting our first year.

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,720
We have it at the end of the year

54
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,560
musical that is essentially

55
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,480
a parody of the GSP.

56
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,480
And we rope in a lot of people

57
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,000
to perform that year.

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,360
A lot of women and men

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,800
who had never danced before found out

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,680
they had love and passion for dance

61
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,520
in their late 20s, early 30s,

62
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,240
because I was really inspired by that.

63
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,360
And so, my classmate and I

64
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,240
started actually teaching around the bay.

65
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,240
And I think my favorite story

66
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,120
is that Heidi Roizen

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,600
at Threshold Ventures came to class,

68
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,920
found out what we were doing,

69
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,120
and she organized

70
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,360
a group of women and a few men.

71
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,120
And we taught them

72
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,560
a full three minute dance

73
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,200
over the course of eight weeks

74
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,480
and had a final performance

75
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,840
at the threshold office.

76
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,680
Which was incredible.

77
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Unbelievable.

78
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,840
So, Tess, walk me a little bit

79
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,080
through your journey.

80
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,880
Why education?

81
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,320
Why Stanford MBA?

82
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,200
What's going on over there?

83
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,040
Yes. It's been an interesting journey.

84
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,920
So, I started my startup journey

85
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,960
in New York.

86
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,320
I had worked at a number of startups

87
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,040
over the course of seven years

88
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,608
before moving to

89
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:07,200
out to the West Coast for GSV.

90
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,720
The first startup I actually worked at

91
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,000
was during college.

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,920
I was an intern

93
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,920
at one of the first companies

94
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
that was part of the first cohort

95
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,880
of TechStars in New York,

96
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,960
and they were an education

97
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,080
technology company.

98
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,320
And this was back in 2011.

99
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,640
And their vision was

100
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,840
to democratize access

101
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,160
to your knowledge on the web

102
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,920
and to help people learn,

103
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,000
adult learners learn new topics

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,320
in a fun way.

105
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,920
That really resonated with me

106
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,280
because I was really passionate about

107
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,600
economic development

108
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,760
and helping people all over the world

109
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,040
find opportunities,

110
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,440
which I think a lot of people

111
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,400
have a similar mission

112
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,920
when they're in college.

113
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,680
But this really felt

114
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,800
like a viable way to do that.

115
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,760
So, I was really excited about

116
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,320
the power of technology

117
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,920
and in spreading education.

118
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,720
I had a few different companies

119
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,280
that I worked at before coming back

120
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,440
full circle to ed tech.

121
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,080
I had worked at two other startups

122
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,560
in New York that were both fast growth,

123
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
learned kind of the ins and outs

124
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,080
of lots of different functions

125
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,000
from sales and account management

126
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,760
to product, people operations,

127
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,240
recruiting, really the full gamut,

128
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
aside from actually

129
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,200
programming and designing

130
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,120
and fell in love with working

131
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,680
with early stage startups.

132
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,400
So, right before I came to the GSV,

133
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,200
I worked at a startup called Andela,

134
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,960
which at the time

135
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,800
was a tiny talent accelerator focused on

136
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,200
high potential young people in Nigeria.

137
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,120
And we were giving them

138
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,849
six months of full stack training

139
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,320
for free

140
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,560
and then helping place them

141
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,960
with long term roles

142
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,640
as distributed engineers.

143
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,680
Really inspiring,

144
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,440
life changing for them, for us,

145
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,720
for the teams that they worked with

146
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,200
all over the world.

147
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,120
Really demonstrated

148
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,720
the power of diverse teams

149
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,480
and it was just an incredible

150
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,640
win-win all around

151
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,680
and commercially viable as well.

152
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,520
So, that startup now, you know,

153
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,240
there are over 2,000 engineers,

154
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,120
in series company, really incredible.

155
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,920
And so I was excited

156
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,440
about that business model.

157
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,760
So, coming to the GSV,

158
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,320
I knew I wanted to stay in ed tech

159
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,240
and workforce development.

160
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,800
So, my summer at Pluralsight,

161
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,280
right after that IPO-ed.

162
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,880
And then coming out of the GSV,

163
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,120
I had to make that decision

164
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,120
of going back to an early stage company,

165
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,200
or as fate will have it,

166
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,800
found out that GSV Ventures,

167
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,280
which is an ed tech venture fund

168
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,880
that focuses on early stage founders,

169
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,640
was hiring in tandem

170
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,560
with growing their second fund.

171
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,640
And so, the stars kind of aligned

172
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,240
and turns out Andela and Pluralsight

173
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,200
were both GSV portfolio companies

174
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,960
and it felt like the right next step.

175
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,680
So, I've been here for about a year now.

176
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,640
That's remarkable.

177
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,080
First of all, it sounds like

178
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,960
over the course of your career,

179
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,600
I mean, it's a formal career

180
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:46,280
as you summarize it.

181
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,320
So, it's huge and impressive but

182
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,600
you know, it sounds like in retrospect,

183
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
it's pretty easy to draw the dots

184
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,800
and to see this linear curve.

185
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,080
But was it a linear career?

186
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,720
Did you imagine when

187
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,520
you were in Africa

188
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,800
that you're going to be in Pluralsights

189
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,640
to the GSB, to GSV?

190
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,040
What was going on there?

191
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,720
No. Absolutely not.

192
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,400
I mean, it's hilarious.

193
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,960
When I look at the resumes

194
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,720
of all my classmates at the GSB

195
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,160
and compare them with mine,

196
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,840
you know that,

197
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,480
so many of them have stories

198
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,680
that they were making

199
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,680
kind of very conscious,

200
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,840
calculated decisions

201
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,680
every step of the way,

202
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,960
and then they got to GSB

203
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,520
and were like,

204
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,240
oh, my God, what now.

205
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,640
So, I've always been a bit like,

206
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,800
oh my God, what now?

207
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,640
And then once I got to GSB,

208
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,640
I actually had more clarity

209
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,120
when I was here

210
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,960
on what I wanted to do.

211
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,880
So coming in, I mean,

212
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,600
I might have been one of the only people

213
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,080
that stuck to what I wrote in my essay.

214
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,240
I wrote that I wanted

215
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,120
to help education technology companies

216
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,920
find viable business models.

217
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,880
Because historically,

218
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,400
it's been very difficult. Right?

219
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,600
And you can even see that

220
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,920
on the funding landscape,

221
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,880
on the number of public companies

222
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,800
in ed tech,

223
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,120
the number of growth companies,

224
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,960
and that's all changing

225
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,080
especially this year, right,

226
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,200
which is great.

227
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,280
But at the time, that was something

228
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
I really wanted to focus on

229
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,160
and what I did coming at the other end.

230
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
But getting there,

231
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,880
yes, like crazy journey.

232
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,160
I worked at a marketing software startup,

233
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,400
I worked at Timehop,

234
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,440
the social media nostalgia app.

235
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,520
Were it's like,

236
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,840
all over the place really,

237
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,600
and all kinds of functions.

238
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,040
But, you know,

239
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,920
I think every step along the way,

240
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,840
I knew it deep in my knowledge

241
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,320
that I wanted to remain in tech.

242
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,320
I love working closely with engineers

243
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,360
and building products

244
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,200
and with early stage founders.

245
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,480
So, it was really concrete

246
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,040
in that area.

247
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,520
And then as time went on,

248
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,560
I realized that I was most inspired

249
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,520
by working at a company

250
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,080
with a strong mission.

251
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,240
And so, the decision, for instance,

252
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,440
to work at Pluralsight,

253
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,720
was part of that.

254
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,760
I wanted to become

255
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,560
more of a sector expert.

256
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,400
I wanted to understand

257
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:51,960
what it was like

258
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,080
at a later stage company

259
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,640
in the tech sector

260
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,360
and how the businesses differ there.

261
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,560
So, sort of, longer than that

262
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,480
but that's the gist of it in a way.

263
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,120
I have to learn a little bit about

264
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,800
the education sector

265
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,480
in order to really grasp

266
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,640
what you're doing in the GSV

267
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,680
and where your passion lies.

268
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,000
Because it sounds like

269
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,040
you fell in love with ed tech.

270
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,640
And with finding a balance between

271
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,720
the right business model

272
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,960
to a high impact opportunity

273
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,680
to really help people, obviously,

274
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,040
through your experience with Africa.

275
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,120
But it sounds like it's deeper than that.

276
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,200
Talk to me a little bit about this

277
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,720
dissonance between finding

278
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,440
a good business model for a high impact

279
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,080
or social good company.

280
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,365
Sure.

281
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:40,600
So, to take a step back,

282
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,840
looking at this problem

283
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,120
through the lens of how

284
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,800
we make investments at GSV,

285
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:46,680
first and foremost,

286
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,720
we always say that

287
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,360
the greatest returns on the fund

288
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,440
will come from the companies

289
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,400
with the greatest impact

290
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,200
and return on education. Right?

291
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,920
And so, these are the companies

292
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,520
that are going to reach

293
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,080
the largest number of learners

294
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,160
or they will be lowering

295
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,760
the cost of education, right,

296
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,160
resulting in being able

297
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,720
to access more learners.

298
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,000
And they're having their strong efficacy

299
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,120
with whatever product

300
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,960
or service that they're offering.

301
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,680
So, improves outcomes for education.

302
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,040
So, we're looking at companies

303
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,480
through those lens

304
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,840
when we're making a decision

305
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
on whether or not we'll invest in them.

306
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,240
So, what that ends up

307
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,120
when you're looking

308
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,800
at very, very early stage companies

309
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,160
and trying to decide

310
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,400
what's going to last,

311
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,040
what's going to be a sustainable model,

312
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,840
what will do all of those things

313
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,200
or a combination of them

314
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,720
is something that, you know, the models

315
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,840
have changed a lot in ed tech.

316
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,960
So, I think in the early days in K-12,

317
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,360
there are a lot of companies

318
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,800
that were trying

319
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,000
to sell directly to schools.

320
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,600
Fast forward today,

321
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,120
you see a lot of different

322
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,280
creative models where someone like,

323
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,720
you know, a class dojo is free

324
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,200
for a number of years and built up

325
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,760
this enormous base of teachers

326
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,440
that were absolutely obsessed

327
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,200
with their product

328
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,640
and it was their lifeblood

329
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,800
for communication

330
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,280
outside of the classroom

331
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,480
with parents and students.

332
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,120
And then they flipped

333
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,560
on monetization last year.

334
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,000
And then, you know,

335
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,640
so, that's more

336
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,400
of a direct to consumer model in a way,

337
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,280
even though it's in the classroom.

338
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,040
And so they don't have to worry about

339
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,840
these really long institutional

340
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,560
school sales cycles

341
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,120
where there's only a limited number

342
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,600
of essentially government dollars

343
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,320
that they're fighting over.

344
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,520
So, companies of today

345
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,000
in ed tech and on K-12

346
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and higher ed, for instance,

347
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,880
are trying to come up

348
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,160
with more creative models.

349
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,760
And things like Course Hero,

350
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,520
for instance,

351
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,240
is a Chegg competitor and they are

352
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,120
a marketplace to student resources.

353
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,040
So, once again,

354
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,160
going straight to the learner

355
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,200
versus going and creating

356
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,680
a university partnership.

357
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:53,880
On the enterprise learning side,

358
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,640
there is something I believe

359
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,600
in for a long time

360
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,760
that adult learners,

361
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,720
that cost of learning, yes,

362
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,320
there is always going to be

363
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,800
an individual cost as life goes on.

364
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,920
But the reality of today is that

365
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,320
we are all going to need

366
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,120
to become lifelong learners.

367
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,640
Whether you understand that now or not,

368
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
we're going to constantly

369
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,480
need new skills,

370
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,280
we are going to constantly

371
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,720
be changing jobs.

372
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,000
And probably, working longer

373
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,200
than any other moment in history.

374
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,520
And so, I would like to see in

375
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,920
and there is a belief

376
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,080
and understanding now

377
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,440
that companies should take on

378
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,400
a lot of that cost

379
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,560
of retraining their employees

380
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,440
over time as well.

381
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,160
So, there are a lot

382
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,120
of business models now

383
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,440
focused on having the company pay

384
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,920
for their employees education.

385
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,040
Whether that's in-house,

386
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,920
because they're going to stay

387
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,480
or like a Pluralsight, for instance,

388
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,360
or Coursera, or it could be someone

389
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,960
like Guild Education that's paying

390
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,320
for their front line workers

391
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,040
to earn college degrees

392
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,160
or skill certificates,

393
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,240
which is pretty incredible.

394
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
And those employees,

395
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:55,465
they know will be leaving.

396
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:59,160
Yeah. So, a few thoughts there.

397
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,080
I just had a fascinating class

398
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,640
at the Graduate School of Engineering

399
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,800
a Product Management class

400
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,680
were actually we were working with Target

401
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,760
and I was the only

402
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,080
Stanford student there.

403
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,720
We had somebody from Amazon,

404
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,040
from Microsoft, from Google.

405
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,560
And because they were coming in

406
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,720
for external training to do

407
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,320
to shift their priorities

408
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,080
within the company,

409
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,040
that I believe some of them

410
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,120
were moving from engineering

411
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,640
to product management.

412
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,120
And all of a sudden,

413
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,560
I find myself working

414
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,800
with people that are 10, 15 years older.

415
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,600
They have all sorts

416
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,040
of different experiences

417
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,360
and that combined learning.

418
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,560
I think obviously, I'm getting much more

419
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,360
excited and emotional

420
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,720
when I think of companies

421
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,200
that are doing it

422
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,120
for the frontline workers

423
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,640
to get college degrees

424
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,560
and something like that.

425
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,600
But it really looks like

426
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,400
the world is changing

427
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,360
to what you were saying.

428
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,840
What are some bigger problems

429
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,880
that we are still thinking of today

430
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,840
in terms of education,

431
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,560
whether it's accessibility,

432
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,720
it's information dissemination.

433
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,280
What are some of those big picture things

434
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,680
that we still haven't figured out?

435
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,920
Yeah. Great question.

436
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,080
Also, love that story.

437
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,680
I think that another thing,

438
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,840
just as a quick aside,

439
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,240
that I think will be huge

440
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,680
is how do we bring together learners

441
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,040
of different ages.

442
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,600
And when you think about adult learning,

443
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,640
age has been such a construct in the past.

444
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,520
And really, like a lot of companies,

445
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,760
are experimenting with adult learning

446
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,960
by creating cohorts

447
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,840
of different age learners.

448
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,680
So, I love that idea.

449
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,160
So, the, sorry,

450
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,080
I just lost track of the question now.

451
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:31,760
The bigger question. Yes.

452
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,880
It's because you're so passionate

453
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,040
about these ideas.

454
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,680
Or just you know, rambling on.

455
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,080
So, a couple of things, though.

456
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,640
I mean, when you look at the US,

457
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,280
for instance, our levels of literacy

458
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,000
and numeracy for college graduates

459
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,680
have not been improving

460
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,080
over the last, like 25 years.

461
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,800
The actual graduation

462
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,640
levels have been improving. Right?

463
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,280
And so, there's been

464
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,760
a huge focus in the US

465
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,400
over the past few, let's say,

466
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,520
presidencies

467
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,240
to increase graduation rates or not.

468
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,480
About 88% national level.

469
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,400
But there are, you know,

470
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,560
the actual outcomes

471
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,960
of high school education are not there.

472
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:17,040
So, when you're thinking about

473
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,840
what problems need to be solved,

474
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,160
that's an enormous one

475
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,160
is the actual efficacy of education

476
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,840
and outcomes there.

477
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,560
It's really hard to change the curriculum

478
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,200
and to change the system.

479
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,280
But the US education levels

480
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,160
are falling behind

481
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,760
many other countries in the world.

482
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,240
And so, if we're thinking about

483
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
something domestic,

484
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,560
that's definitely a huge issue.

485
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,480
And then, of course,

486
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,880
that problem applies to any potentially

487
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,840
like emerging country as well.

488
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,360
We're used to having

489
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,720
an enormous number of learners

490
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,600
and so, you are obviously not

491
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,880
going to have

492
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,720
the right number of teachers

493
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,880
that are able to see drive

494
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,840
those outcomes either potentially.

495
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,720
So, that's a big one for sure.

496
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,600
The other one in higher education,

497
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,800
we're going to be

498
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,400
over doubling the number

499
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,120
of college age students

500
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,600
in the next 10 to 15 years.

501
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,880
And there just aren't enough

502
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,080
institutions in the world

503
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,960
that have the capacity to educate

504
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,760
the number of college age students.

505
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,240
That's an enormous problem.

506
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,960
By the way, why is that happening?

507
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,360
The world population growth.

508
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,160
They're just going to be

509
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,320
an enormous number of people

510
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,760
of that age level.

511
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,000
And so, in terms of traditional

512
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,120
institutions, you know,

513
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,040
you can't spend up a college overnight.

514
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,120
You can't, you know,

515
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
when you think about things

516
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,320
like accreditation,

517
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,720
which is a huge obstacle

518
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,680
in higher ed innovation in the US

519
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,760
so, making sure that students

520
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,640
are getting credit

521
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,120
for the courses that they're taking,

522
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,520
you know, a ton of hurdles there.

523
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,280
It is an archaic system

524
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,880
that stifles a lot of innovation.

525
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,800
But then, you know,

526
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,040
and then internationally, same issue.

527
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:58,880
So, one thing that we need to deal with

528
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,400
and think ahead

529
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,480
for which companies like Coursera

530
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,280
and others are doing is

531
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,520
how can we create online programs

532
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,040
that maybe aren't for full degrees,

533
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,160
but there's still a skills base,

534
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,760
potentially certifications

535
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,720
that have the branding

536
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,200
that are recognized by employers.

537
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,840
There needs to be a shift

538
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,920
from the employer side

539
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,760
to accept these new types of trainings.

540
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,400
And we need to find a way to educate

541
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,440
that group of college,

542
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,680
"traditionally college age learners"

543
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,800
coming down the road.

544
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,600
And then the enterprise,

545
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,840
I think I've mentioned it already.

546
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,720
But just thinking about

547
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,480
how do you map the skills

548
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,920
within your organization,

549
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,400
understand the gaps

550
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,040
and then help up and up and reskill,

551
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,000
which is there's a lot,

552
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,840
a lot of like hot conversation

553
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,480
around right now

554
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,200
and everyone knows

555
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,040
they need to do it.

556
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,880
But actually figuring it out

557
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,000
is very difficult.

558
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,720
Especially in roles that aren't,

559
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,080
you know,

560
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,200
that have more of an emphasis

561
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,040
on soft skills

562
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,760
or things that are historically

563
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,280
hard to measure.

564
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,400
It's tough to figure out

565
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
how to handle those.

566
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,480
Tess, I have to say that,

567
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,840
you know, I've done quite

568
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
a few of these episodes.

569
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,880
One of the things that inspires me most

570
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,000
across these episodes

571
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,800
is when I meet people

572
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,440
that are just truly passionate

573
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,120
and curious about what they're doing.

574
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,560
That their positions there

575
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,400
and it's not just because

576
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
it was a cool opportunity

577
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,080
and just a nice jumpstart.

578
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,520
But really,

579
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,760
they're following this trajectory

580
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,960
of following their passion,

581
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,040
following their curiosity.

582
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,720
It's something that I live by

583
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,360
and that I've become

584
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,960
more and more inspired through this show

585
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,600
that the people that are really making

586
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,920
a difference are those that

587
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,600
they are truly following their passions.

588
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,960
And things don't become easy,

589
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,000
but they become doable

590
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,040
and they become energized.

591
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,440
And I'm learning so much

592
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,120
just from this

593
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,560
short 20 minute conversation.

594
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,640
Tell me a little bit about

595
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,080
the Girl Develop It.

596
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,160
You are on the advisory board there.

597
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,240
What are you doing over there

598
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,520
and what is sort of the mission?

599
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,840
Because it sounds really phenomenal.

600
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,880
Yes, Girl Developer It

601
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,880
is a nonprofit that's been around

602
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,680
for a long time now,

603
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,560
almost 10 years.

604
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,720
And they've reached over

605
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,240
100,000 adult learners,

606
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,760
primarily women.

607
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,040
They provide free

608
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,760
or low cost introductory level courses

609
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,800
in programming topics,

610
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,120
and they've expanded a bit more

611
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
to things like digital marketing

612
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,200
and a few others.

613
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,680
But it's really incredible.

614
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,640
I mean, the goal is

615
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,000
to create an environment

616
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,040
where adult learners,

617
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,320
it was intended originally for women,

618
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,960
but it's really open to anyone,

619
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,080
can learn in a judgment free space.

620
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,200
You know, If they have been stuck in

621
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,800
and maybe just a pretty average role

622
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
for the last 10, 15, 20 years.

623
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,560
Maybe they have a degree,

624
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,720
maybe they don't.

625
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,840
I mean, really,

626
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,280
we have learners of all ages.

627
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,280
They can come to Girl Development.

628
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,760
They can say, I'm curious about

629
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,840
unity development,

630
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,320
I'm curious about dev ops,

631
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,680
I'm curious about JavaScript,

632
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,360
Maybe I heard about it on a podcast,

633
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,880
maybe I heard about it from a friend,

634
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,880
but I have no idea where to even start.

635
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,600
I'm embarrassed.

636
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,480
I don't even know the right

637
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,760
questions to ask.

638
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,480
And they can come and take a course

639
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,200
and then start to create

640
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,400
a new career trajectory from there.

641
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,800
So, really incredible.

642
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,240
There are volunteer instructors

643
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,880
who are also paid

644
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,760
time for teaching the classes.

645
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,560
And yeah, it's really just an amazing,

646
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,560
amazing non-profit

647
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,640
and it's really fun story

648
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,560
how I got involved.

649
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,560
I met an entrepreneur named Brenda Jin

650
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,600
in January last year.

651
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,720
So, we've only known each other

652
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,280
or about a year.

653
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,920
It wasn't the right fit

654
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,680
for an investment,

655
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,200
but her and I really hit it off

656
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,280
and have become

657
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,680
kind of thought partners and friends.

658
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,800
And so, she asked me

659
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,080
to get involved this summer.

660
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,120
And it's been a blast.

661
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,520
We had a mini conference.

662
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,280
We got Unity involved,

663
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,960
the teacher in course sponsor it.

664
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,560
And Unity's a partner of GSVs.

665
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,800
So, it's just amazing to see

666
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,840
how the education ecosystem,

667
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,520
everybody really plays together

668
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,560
and supports one another.

669
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,760
Tess, it sounds phenomenal.

670
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,720
I thank you for all the work

671
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,560
that you're doing, both with the GSV,

672
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,320
but also on these advisory roles.

673
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,200
And for teaching dance.

674
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,800
I'm still owe to take,

675
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,760
to take the social dance class

676
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,200
that I'm supposed to.

677
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,000
One day, hopefully I would get in touch

678
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,640
with Philly as well at the GSV.

679
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,080
But for now

680
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,280
I'll do the social dance class.

681
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,520
Tess, three words

682
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,960
that you would use to describe yourself.

683
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,080
And thank you for being

684
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,400
so generous with your time here.

685
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,200
Sure, great question.

686
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,480
This is very difficult.

687
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,880
So, I mean, I think that two

688
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,800
the two more obvious ones, if you will,

689
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,320
I would say, number one is optimistic.

690
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,960
That's just for better or for worse,

691
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,720
part of my DNA.

692
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,760
Yeah. I think that's anyone that's working

693
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,200
in an early stage startup,

694
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,840
anyone that's just constantly

695
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,920
trying new things

696
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,360
like you kind of have to be

697
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,760
and you want to see things come to life.

698
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,720
And yes, that's a big one.

699
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,560
And then, I hear this one a lot.

700
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,720
So, I guess I could say it's

701
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,360
maybe not self described,

702
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,560
but energetic.

703
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,920
So, really, like, I try to bring energy

704
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,280
to everything I do.

705
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:17,960
But it's true.

706
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,320
It's something I realized over time,

707
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,400
and the longer and longer

708
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,560
you're in the workforce

709
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
and then, you know,

710
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,320
maybe increasingly difficult roles

711
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,200
or more responsibility, etc.

712
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,800
like the energy you put out

713
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,600
into the world

714
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,120
is how you're going to see

715
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,880
that's going to reflect on others

716
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,720
and really kind of change the mood

717
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,240
of a team you're working on.

718
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,320
And endure oneself,

719
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,280
that's something I focus on a lot.

720
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,520
And then, I guess the last one

721
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,080
would be maybe somewhere around,

722
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,720
so, I used to also teach kids

723
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,640
creative movement in shelters

724
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,000
in New York for nine years

725
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,080
of another nonprofit.

726
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,840
So, dance,

727
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,200
but it's more creative movement.

728
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,760
And I kind of love this idea,

729
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,440
of not just exactly creativity,

730
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,360
but something around

731
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,880
like creativity, fluidity, where,

732
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,360
you know, no matter what's coming at you,

733
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,560
you're able to

734
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,520
kind of make something out of it

735
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,680
and feel something from it, adapt,

736
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,240
like something along the lines of that.

737
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,520
And so, maybe it's more of a,

738
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,480
like a dance move.

739
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,160
You're like living with a dance move.

740
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,600
Some concepts around there.

741
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
I love that.

742
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,520
I attribute a lot of my optimism

743
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,360
and my, you know,

744
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,760
the fact that I am energized

745
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,320
whenever something changes

746
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,880
or whenever I'm tackling a challenge

747
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,800
to the fact that I participated in a lot

748
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,200
of high school musicals

749
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,560
when I was back in high school.

750
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,760
That was one of my favorite hobbies.

751
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,720
Because it was all about

752
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,680
interchanging ideas.

753
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,480
And then, you know,

754
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,280
and then, the bridge would fall

755
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,680
from the stage,

756
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,120
because somebody pushed it by accident

757
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,760
then you have to now respond to it

758
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,280
and have fun with it.

759
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,120
Exactly.

760
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,840
So, I attribute a lot of that to that.

761
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,400
Tess, Thank you so, so much.

762
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,320
This was wonderful.

763
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,280
Thank you for the Inspiration.

764
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,240
It was great.

765
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,480
Thank you Michael.

766
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,360
That's awesome.

767
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,680
And one day we'll put together

768
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,640
a musical in our staff together.

769
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,560
100%.
