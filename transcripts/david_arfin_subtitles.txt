Wonderful. Okay, great. David Arfin, thank you so much for being on my show 20 Minute Leaders. My pleasure. Good to be here. I can't wait for this. [--] Yeah. Well, first off, where are you because this is not a virtual background. A lot of people have this is as a virtual background, but you're actually there. I am right now staying in Potomac, Maryland, which is a suburb of DC. I was actually born in Potomac, Maryland. So, it's quite a funny coincidence. No kidding. Yes. So, we are very close to Great Falls Park, which is just, it's a national treasure, as are all of our national parks. Wonderful. Thank you so much for taking the time to do this. I think it's very, it makes a lot of sense that this is your background, given that you're an expert in renewable energy and working in fast growing companies that are making a real difference in the world. Very quick background. Stanford MBA in the Graduate School of Business. Moving on, you held numerous executive positions, Solar City, Ninedot, so many others that I missed along the way. But I'd love to hear a little bit about you from your journey going into the space. So, I'd say the journey, I can't say, gee, when I was a business school student or an undergraduate, this is what I always wanted to do in my life. Each thing is a response to the needs, opportunities and creativity that I can bring to it. So, I started professional life as a community organizer in the Jewish community in Los Angeles. Working for the GCRC, which brought in some values that I care deeply about. I worked in Washington, DC as a health staffer and as an education lobbyist. Then I went to business school, got a entrepreneurial bug. Started a few companies, and then ended up in 2006 seeing the Al Gore movie Inconvenient Truth. And that was eye opening both from the issues around climate change, as well as the business opportunities to create some interesting, sustainable businesses. So, by a little work and a bunch of discussions and happenstance, I came up with a pretty good idea, together with some other people, to do a solar leasing program. So, instead of somebody having to make a massive investment on having to buy something that they never bought before, and they think it's a good idea, but it's a hard decision to make. Instead, change the ownership model, work with some of the incentives that are out there and create something new. And I did that. And I have been fortunate to be able to take that idea. And once that spun off of it and spend the last 14 years working in energy with fantastic people. Unbelievable. And, you know, one of the things that have always intrigued me as an entrepreneur, I'm thinking about solar and I'm thinking about this transition of how do you get, even when the technology matures, how do you get people to buy into this, the average citizen? And I think a lot of it ties back to the way people manage their money and how they think about expenses and rewards, because essentially the sell, if I understand it correctly, let's say solar panels on the roof. The sell is you're gonna pay a lot of money now, you're gonna return the money slowly. And within a few years, they're gonna reach a break even point, and then you're going to start saving money. But it's a very different thing than, you're not saying, "Here, I'm gonna give you cash." You're saying, "You're gonna lose less." Right? It's a different mindset. It's a different sell. Yeah. A lot of what I think about is risk and reward. Right. And kind of behavioral economics. So, if you basically take, we all have these little things here, right? Yup. These are new cell phones. And we know we are going to be subscribing to expensive services the rest of our lives. And if somebody came up to us and said, "Gee, wouldn't it be nice if you just put up $30 thousand and we will, that's gonna prepay the rest of your life of cell phones." You may say, "That's a terrific idea." But instead, I'd rather spend a thousand dollars a year on it over the next 40 years, hopefully. Right. Maybe 50 if I'm pushing it. But whatever that took with it, whatever that create it. So, the telecom industry built out the infrastructure and made a compelling proposition to customers to pay by the month, to pay by the day. To pay, in autos, it's paid by the mile. And that's basically how you get new technologies adopted faster. You know, the old Xerox machine, it's hard to sell it for five thousand dollars to an office. Sell it for 10 cents a copy? Go ahead. All day long. Right. Okay. That's fascinating. But so, nevertheless, you watch the Al Gore movie. Is that really the turning point for you when you realize that there was a huge problem in the world and then you decide to spend the next 14 years working on these things? Well, I kind of knew there was a problem in the world. I just didn't know how I connected to it. Okay. So since then, you've held all these positions. When did you join Solar City as Vice President? I joined Solar City in the very early days in May of 2007. Wow. And so, I had the idea of a solar leasing product. Lyndon Wright and Peter Wright, the co-founders of Solar City, instantly got like financing was important and perhaps just as important that Elon Musk understood that customer financing was important. So, they basically said, "Ah. That's the idea that we need to be able to go from being a small company to being a large company to being a massive company." Ended up getting 35% market share in the United States. Which is just unheard of. Unbelievable. So, essentially as part of Solar City, talk to me a little bit about this journey, because  you have the privilege of being as a pioneer in this realm of transitioning a country and going solar and seeing this technology develop and seeing how customers interact with it. So, and you're actually working on strategy, right? Within solar cities. So, how do you work on strategy in the context of renewable energy? Wow. Well, you start by understanding what the customers want and where where markets are. In energy. you have to be very policy sensitive because everything depends on the tariffs that you pay. The incentives and the penalties that are out there. A few two different things. So, you have to understand and it's a very interdisciplinary area, which is why I like it. So, some of my time I get to be, what is strategy? It's a combination of economics, of consumer behavior, risk and psychology, finance, energy, hardware, devices and accounting and policy. And I'm not an expert at any one of those things, but I have enough experience and kind of just see or observe things in the world where you can combine those. And if you do that, you can come up with some interesting solutions. And what I loved about Solar City was they let me create this solution, encouraged me to create it, put their muscle behind it and changed the organization, changed the industry. And that was a commitment from leadership. And Lyndon Rive in particular, to understand that we needed to sell things differently, we needed to approach the consumer differently. And it was a really interesting disciplinary approach and it was a big risk. I thought it was obvious that it would work. And there were months and months that was hard to do. And in particular, when we started this, remember I said we joined in 2000 and I joined Solar City right as they head-started in 2007. That was right before the big crash of 2008. So, to go to the Wall Street banks and to say, "We'd like you to buy a portfolio of 5000 rooftop solar systems." during the midst of a housing crisis that we have never seen before. And the security on this is gonna be a little less than you would get on a second mortgage. You know, we had a lot of doors slammed in our face. But we had good people on our team and very good people on the Morgan Stanley team at the time. And we were able to get deals done. And that set a trajectory for me, for the business and for the industry. Unbelievable. And through Solar City, did you ever cross parcels so with Elon and get to hear a little bit about his perspective and how he sees the industry? I did. And Elon is a very bright guy. Much more introverted than his public persona on Twitter. His Twitter, I was just about to say, yeah, He's really an engineer. Right. And he sees what is possible and then doesn't understand why you go from what is possible to, why can't you do it tomorrow? Let's get this thing out there. Let's push. Because he started a PayPal. He actually had a natural, let's just say, dislike or suspicion of banks. Yeah. He said basically, you're gonna go to banks. You're gonna explain this idea. You're gonna explain to them how they can make a lot of money and they're not gonna know what to do with this or they're gonna try to steal your idea. Right. So, he's an incredibly bright guy. And he was very supportive of helping to steer the ship towards a mass customer experience. He just wants everything done really quickly. Perfectly. Yeah. And yesterday. And as a result, the management style, he gets a lot out of people. And everybody who's worked in an organization for him for a period of time will tell you that they contributed. If they didn't contribute, they were out. And they gave a lot of themselves. And that's, I called it a management bonus or a management characteristic. You work really hard. I mean, I think at the end a lot of people are working on ventures, and I'm thinking constantly about things that I wanna do later on, as an entrepreneur myself. That's part of the motivation for speaking to you here and getting this inspiration. At the end, when you're talking about changing the world and actually changing the world, not writing that on a slide deck and saying, "I'm gonna revolutionize XYZ." But actually going and doing it. You know, I think that at the end you can forgive a little bit of an offset in expenses myself, but you can forgive a little bit of hard work and a little bit of pushing and the results are showing. But, David I'm talking to you now as a young entrepreneur. I'm gonna go on my own path. I'm gonna have to make some difficult decisions on what I work on, how I work on it and with who. And I'd love to get a little bit of insight into this world of renewable energy, which you're an expert on by now. What are some of the things that are happening around the world in this industry that I should be aware of? Because honestly, it's not the sexiest thing in the hallways of Stanford right now and probably not in the lot of places in the world. So, let's talk about renewable energy. Right. So, there's so many different ways to start to answer that question. Good. We have to we have about seven minutes so, we can talk about everything. So we'll flow on advice that's not a problem. So, I am against of just separate to the grid connected world where we can improve our energy sources, and the off grid world. And there are, call it, two billion people out there in the world today without reliable access to electricity. Two billion without electricity. Without reliable access. Without reliable access to electricity. So, and some without electricity at all. But it's also the reliability. If you have electricity three or four hours a day, that's a lot better than nothing. But you still have have other needs. So, I would start with the ability to look at the world. That is what we call off-grid or semi off-grid and look at what it is that can be done to bring electricity and literally light to those people. And that's maybe 250 million people in India throughout Latin America and Africa. And there's just, suburbs are going to be very different. They don't have all the appliances because they don't have electricity, obviously. So, bringing in a light, having them also on a pay as you go system, I think is really terrific and important. And whether that's the lights for their house or there in the village. Whether it's a light for their working place, whether it's refrigeration, being able to charge their cell phones. Let me ask you this, David, Is the problem, so, we have electricity in many places around the world. And we have these systems. Is the problem, I want to know whether it's the chicken or the egg problem? Do we have the technology and we just have to spend money to scale it and implement it there? Or are we looking for more financially viable solutions, more technologically savvy solutions to make it more efficient? And because we don't have them yet. That's why we don't have electricity. Which one is it? So, for solar, for wind, for bio gas, we have the technology today. That is plenty good to be able to make us much, much more energy independent. We still have to evolve. We still have to improve. We still have to make inverters better. We have to capture more hours of sunlight in different ways, Per square foot that you're using. But the technology is there. I think a second part of energy is storing it. So, you can have windmills tilt. Wind turbines going all night long offshore or in the Midwest. But that's not where the demand is. That's not where the load is. So, you have to be able to bring that somewhere. And it's really good to have a, you need storage and storage is coming. It's here. But the prices have to come down. And just like in solar panel, solar panels cost 10% of what they did when I started over a decade ago. They're 10% now. And we're gonna get the same thing with storage and we're gonna get other system. So I think, Look, I'm MBA. I'm not technical. I wish I could develop the next generation of solar panel or a chemical reaction that brings more energy better, faster. That's not me. That's a lot of smart people using AI or other ways to invent the technologies and improve the technologies. I look at the world from a, how do you get people to adapt? What's the business model that you can look at and says, "I can get on one hand the end user to adapt, and on the other hand, somebody to underwrite the risk that technology will work and that person will pay for it. Why are there two billion people without electricity if we have solar, wind, water, We have all these possibilities. Why aren't we just spending the billions necessary and we are spending the money on different things. But why are we not spending them on providing electricity? What are we waiting for? Is this policy issue, a governmental bureaucracy issue? Is this a technology issue? I'd say it is 90% government bureaucracy policy. Not sending the grid into areas that need the grid. And if you go to these remote areas that have democracy, for example, you will often hear, "Yes. The power grid is coming." "Vote for me." "I will get power to you." "I will get electricity to you." And every few years when the election comes up, the same types of promises are made. But then there is not the follow through. There's a technical challenge, which is you have to run wires and you have to build infrastructure. And countries can do that. And states or provinces can do that. But it requires a level of discipline and working through things. And it's incredibly slow. I mean, if you look at America, we didn't have much electricity a hundred years ago. You know, we've got one of the greatest grid in the world. And that was done largely because of policies and government support. And I'm not saying that we're in the same place in these rural areas, but there's so much more that can be done. And I think business model evolution is a part of what that is. Right. It makes a lot of sensitivity. After so many years in this industry, what are you excited about today? Tomorrow morning, what are you gonna be working on that really excites you. New business models that basically take policies, economics, incentives, customer behavioral things. We're working on some really interesting things in New York City now on community energy and Ninedot Energy is leading the way. And hopefully come September, we will bring on a seven and a half megawatt system, which will bring 60 million kilowatt hours a year onto the grid for the next 25 years. And our users will be all over New York City. And it's gonna support the grid in unique ways. So, I'm excited about. And I'm also excited about more solar and more electric vehicles, Mopeds. What is that? What is a mopeds? Electric mopeds like the rebel system, which is just amazing. Okay. I love scooters and docking stations like the one Swiftmile makes. Yeah. Yeah. It's just there's so much cool stuff out there. And in this covid area, we kind of see a lot of problems and life is gonna change. And one of this things might change is how we use our vehicles and what types of vehicles we use and which streets are like. And how much of our land we end up using to park cars and to move cars. You know, one of the most difficult things, and I'm looking at Tel Aviv, I'm riding here my bike in Palo Alto and it's beautiful. There's a bike lane everywhere. It's so wide and wonderful. I go to Tel Aviv Yafo and we have hundreds of scooters waiting to be ridden. And I'm scared to death. I want to ride a scooter. I want to ride my bike in Tel Aviv, but I can't. But I do wanna ask though, we're both a part of J-Ventures. And so, we're looking at a bunch of early stage companies. Are we seeing an increase in companies that are dealing with these problems or is there a shortage of good talent that is trying to work with electricity, with mobility, within renewable energy? There's a lot of talent coming in. There's a lot of talent in the field. The key thing and the signals are going to be how will investors look at these opportunities? And I think we have seen a lot of excitement on vehicles, on rebel which I mentioned the scooter craze. What happened? You know, it was a bubble from a valuation side, but it also prove the point. And then created the opportunities for things like these docking station for a recharging economy. So, there will be electric vehicle and not just electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, cars that we could think of, truck lines that go on various routes and then can draft behind each other in very short separation and save on fuel costs. From that water, and it's not just electricity. It's also on the water side and other resources that actually consume a ton of electricity. But there's opportunities. Hopefully the venture crowd and the venture world and they have a lot of mind to think, in the venture world that they follow each other. And when the word gets out that clean tech is great, Like it was in the [--], then there is a lot of investment. And then all of a sudden the word got out. It's tough. We don't know enough. So, I think that's gonna happen. What I'm really excited about now is kind of the combination of very large commitments by companies to lower their carbon footprint and things that would have taken four years to get through committees and processes to do a power purchase agreement for a solar farm or whatever. Now, whoever runs energy there they could show that it's a fair deal, a good deal, they're saving on carbon and they're saving money. They can get those through. And that combined with the things like the Gates Foundation and our breakthrough energy and other major foundations, the Rockefeller family. Folks who are saying, "What got us here won't get us there." And we're heading from a climate side is disastrous. We know this and, but there's a lot of fund solutions out there. And whether it's just high tech and can develop something big, or figure out a better model for the scooters, how to move scooters, how to build lanes for the scooters, how to signal. The one thing I'd love to throw out there for the world that we need desperately is a cheap, dispensable or disposable helmet. It comes with every scooter ride and every little bike rental in the city. That happens because people like you, like me go on Tel Aviv, we go on these scooters and we are less of taxi than we know we should be. I completely agree. David, I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. Three words to describe myself. Adventurous. I love new adventures. It's why I'm an entrepreneur. And it's why I get to live in different parts of the world. This is a hyphenated word, Values driven. Okay. Sure. I do things that are consistent with the values and work with people who are consistent with the values that I hold. And Indomitable. You may not know that word. I don't. I don't know the word in Hebrew, But indomitable is It's what entrepreneurs need to be. They don't see at what age as something that is insurmountable. You keep going. You keep working. You try this way. You try that way. I love it. And my friend Rich Kelly gave me that name. And I like indomitable. So, there we go. I love it. David, thank you very much. Toda raba. Thank you for the inspiration. Thank you for the work you're doing. Toda raba Michael.This is a pleasure. [--] Toda raba. Bye bye. Bye bye.
