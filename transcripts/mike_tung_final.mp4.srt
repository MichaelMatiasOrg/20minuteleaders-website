1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,759
Visit all of the pages of the web,

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,159
we actually render each page

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,359
in a real web browser

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,479
so that our AI can see the page

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,360
just like a human does.

6
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:09,239
It can see the actual pixels,

7
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,160
the look of the page.

8
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:10,799
So, it's more than

9
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,000
just a text of a page.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,159
Mike Tung, thank you

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,919
for being on my show.

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,439
How are you

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,560
all the way from Silicon Valley?

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:45,840
I'm doing well.

15
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:47,679
Thanks a lot for having me.

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,439
I'm very excited

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,879
to chat with you about AI,

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,359
about your entrepreneurial journey,

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,280
what you're doing at Diffbot.

20
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:53,519
But we have to go back

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,799
to being a child musician

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,199
playing at Carnegie Hall.

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,919
What is that about?

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,599
How do you get

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,480
to play Carnegie Hall as a child?

26
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:06,279
Well, I think my story is similar

27
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,119
to a lot of Chinese Americans,

28
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,400
they're sort of forced

29
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:11,239
to play an instrument

30
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,439
at a young age by their family.

31
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,200
But I think,

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,320
you know, the main purpose of that

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,920
is just to learn discipline

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,720
and learn practice.

35
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:21,879
So, as a child,

36
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,679
I played the violin for maybe,

37
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't know,

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,600
about 18 years or so before college.

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,480
And I ended up playing

40
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:32,479
with a group at Carnegie Hall.

41
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,759
That's remarkable.

42
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,599
So, you grew up in Taiwan, right?

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,399
You're an immigrant from Taiwan.

44
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:37,999
Tell me a little bit

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,199
about your background

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,760
and moving along with that background

47
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,880
through Carnegie Hall

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,760
to get to doing AI

49
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,640
at Stanford for your Masters.

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,120
Wow. It's a lot to compress in it.

51
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,680
A lot of years to compress.

52
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:55,159
But basically, I was born in Taiwan.

53
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,759
I immigrated to the US

54
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,000
when I was about two years old.

55
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,439
So, I don't remember too much

56
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,479
about Taiwan from back then.

57
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,119
But my parents, my dad

58
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,239
came to the US as a grad student,

59
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,679
studying biochemistry,

60
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,919
and he later on taught at universities

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,239
as a professor in pathology.

62
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,199
And later off to spun

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,279
and founded his own biotech company.

64
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,319
That he's developing actually vaccines

65
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,080
for HIV and even one for covid

66
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,320
right now, over in Atlanta, Georgia.

67
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,800
Wow.

68
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,360
And so, I grew up

69
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,480
in a very entrepreneurial family.

70
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,120
Growing up in a

71
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,200
very entrepreneurial family,

72
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,000
what does that mean?

73
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:37,079
You immigrated from Taiwan.

74
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,879
You were telling me about

75
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,959
what your father was doing,

76
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,519
but what does it mean

77
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,319
being in an entrepreneurial family?

78
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,959
Well, it just means I guess

79
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,519
it was something accepted

80
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,159
or at least not crazy

81
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,039
to be an entrepreneur

82
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,200
since it ran in the family, I guess.

83
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,328
However, you know,

84
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:57,719
while the rest of my family

85
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,439
is sort of in at biotech in biology

86
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,639
and I worked at my dad's lab

87
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,639
actually growing up,

88
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,159
and I realized that, you know,

89
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,919
it's I wasn't cut out

90
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,440
sort of to do biology.

91
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,039
I spent many hours waiting

92
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,359
for centrifuges to run, you know,

93
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,439
extracting DNA and building viruses

94
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,999
and watching various kinds

95
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,440
of clear fluids develop.

96
00:03:19,441 --> 00:03:20,759
And, you know,

97
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,599
I needed a faster iteration cycle

98
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,120
than that waiting days and days

99
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,079
for an experiment to run

100
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,639
and not knowing where you messed up,

101
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,439
maybe like in day two.

102
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,199
And that's kind of how

103
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,839
I came to computer science.

104
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,079
So, you're looking

105
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,199
from this agile approach

106
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,943
where you get to see results fast,

107
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:41,060
iterate, pivot, iterate

108
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:42,679
and get to deeper results.

109
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,519
And you find your way

110
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,479
towards Stanford master's in AI,

111
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,639
working in the AI lab.

112
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,479
Talk to me a little bit about

113
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,199
what you're doing there.

114
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,879
And what draws you specifically

115
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,440
to artificial intelligence then?

116
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,280
Well, I mean, so it just started out

117
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,200
playing with computers,

118
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,680
developing video games,

119
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,440
I think like a lot of the typical story

120
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,120
of a lot of computer programmers.

121
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,520
And after high school, actually,

122
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,480
I instead of going directly to college,

123
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,520
I worked for about a year

124
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,200
at Microsoft as a software engineer.

125
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,919
Because I thought growing up,

126
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,639
Microsoft is the place where they

127
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,839
really invented software development.

128
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,119
Right.

129
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,639
And I read about Bill Gates story.

130
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,439
And then so I went there.

131
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,279
I got to meet him.

132
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,759
Like all the interns are invited

133
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,560
to his house over the summer.

134
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,560
I think back then,

135
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,920
I got to go to his backyard

136
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:31,000
and check out his place.

137
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,839
And I learned a ton

138
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,799
when I was at Microsoft.

139
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,959
But I also realized,

140
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,720
I probably don't want

141
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,680
to work in a big company

142
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,171
for the rest of my life.

143
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:41,640
What made you realize that?

144
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,280
What was it about

145
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,200
the big company,

146
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,720
that culture that you said,

147
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,360
okay, maybe, I'm more into

148
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:49,999
the small company space?

149
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,599
Well, I thought

150
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,519
it was a great experience

151
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,439
actually working at Microsoft.

152
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,000
I learned

153
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:56,061
an incredible deal about

154
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,199
how like professional software

155
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,279
development is done,

156
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,079
but I realized,

157
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,079
I want to do something of my own.

158
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,639
I want to I, you know,

159
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,720
my bosses and mentors

160
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,439
when I was working at Microsoft,

161
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,759
I had to really think,

162
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,199
do I really want to be like that

163
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,760
in 20 years or 30 years.

164
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:13,000
Right?

165
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,959
Kind of doing that kind of work.

166
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,759
And I just wanted to do more.

167
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,519
And I wanted to work in a place

168
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,399
that I was not constrained

169
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,239
by the organization

170
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,679
where I was sort of like,

171
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,786
I think that's why a lot of people

172
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:29,679
do entrepreneurship,

173
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,959
because they can't really work

174
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,760
for anybody else.

175
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,519
So, throughout these experiences,

176
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,239
you are getting into the,

177
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,719
more into the artificial intelligence,

178
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,999
what do you actually do at Stanford?

179
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,279
What is your masters in

180
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,799
and what leads you then towards

181
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,559
this idea for Diffbot?

182
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,719
Yeah. So, I was interested in AI,

183
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,039
I guess, way before it was popular

184
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,999
from a pretty young age.

185
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,679
Like when I was

186
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,399
even in high school,

187
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,639
I was like developing

188
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,879
neural networks to like

189
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,639
the trade stocks and stuff

190
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,519
from reading like a sentiment

191
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,719
on the very nascent Internet

192
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,600
at that point in time.

193
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,639
So, I had always

194
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,239
been fascinated by AI

195
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,480
and building intelligent systems.

196
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,640
At Berkeley, I finished

197
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,520
an undergrad in ECS

198
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:15,639
in about two years

199
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,760
and then quickly

200
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,280
moved to grad school at Stanford.

201
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,000
And I took a heavy concentration

202
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:24,399
in AI courses.

203
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,160
And so, it was at around

204
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:27,399
that time when

205
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,360
there was a data set

206
00:06:28,361 --> 00:06:29,079
that was being built

207
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,399
at Stanford called ImageNet,

208
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,280
which was basically like,

209
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,120
you know, a large collection

210
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
of labeled images.

211
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,440
They basically use

212
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,560
Amazon Mechanical Turk

213
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,120
to label all these images

214
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,960
from Google image search.

215
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,920
And I was thinking, okay,

216
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,600
how can we build

217
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,440
like an image net for language.

218
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,480
Because, unlike vision, like

219
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,400
the human language,

220
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,240
what we're using right now

221
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,040
is what distinguishes

222
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,080
humans from animals.

223
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,360
Like even my dog has computer vision.

224
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,520
He can tell the difference between

225
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,240
this ball and a toy,

226
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,680
you know, a grassy field.

227
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,160
But animals don't have anything

228
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:01,079
like human language.

229
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,959
Right?

230
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,399
So, I was thinking about this problem

231
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,720
and why is there no, like,

232
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,000
image net for language,

233
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,440
even today,

234
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,200
there isn't really something like that.

235
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,931
And it's because

236
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:10,120
there's way more concepts

237
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,200
that humans have created

238
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,360
than there are like

239
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,560
a thousand image classes.

240
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
And it would take

241
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:15,959
up to 50 man decades

242
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,600
in order to

243
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,079
build such a data set.

244
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,359
Right?

245
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,879
So, that's when I started thinking.

246
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,479
Okay, what if we could use AI

247
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,319
to automatically construct

248
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,719
actually a structured data set

249
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,543
of all the concepts

250
00:07:26,544 --> 00:07:29,171
that  human beings care about.

251
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,559
What greater resources there

252
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,639
than the Internet itself.

253
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,959
The Internet I view as basically

254
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,319
kind of like the world's largest

255
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,519
manmade censor.

256
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,399
Anything that's an important entity,

257
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,439
someone's created a page

258
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,999
for on the Internet.

259
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,239
Right?

260
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,119
And the only problem

261
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,839
with the Internet is that

262
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,239
it's not an structured format

263
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,879
that's needed for machine learning

264
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,559
and AI to use.

265
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,079
So, I started thinking

266
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,079
back then about how

267
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,319
can we actually convert the Internet

268
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,679
into actually like a structured data set

269
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,559
that then applications can use.

270
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,639
Wow. Fascinating.

271
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,319
So, that's the research

272
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,559
that you're going towards.

273
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,839
And I'm also aware

274
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,679
that you've given

275
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,239
quite a few guest lectures at Stanford

276
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,039
about Knowledge Graphs

277
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,680
and about the different

278
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:09,439
work that you've done in this field.

279
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,800
So, take me through this

280
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,360
entrepreneurial journey.

281
00:08:13,361 --> 00:08:13,919
How do you take

282
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,119
a research question

283
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,359
that you're so excited about

284
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,479
and translate that into a company

285
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,886
that you're running along

286
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:20,986
with the work that you're doing

287
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:22,071
at Stanford?

288
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,079
Well, I wouldn't say

289
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,679
it was a very direct journey.

290
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,079
So, I don't think you

291
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,759
just start on such a task

292
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
like that directly.

293
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,839
During Stanford,

294
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,239
I was doing this research

295
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,239
and, you know, sort of,

296
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,279
I guess, trying to delay

297
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,639
from writing a thesis

298
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,719
because it's very hard to come up

299
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,359
with, like a breakthrough

300
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,999
machine learning algorithm.

301
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,759
And so I was doing a lot

302
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,519
of side things.

303
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,999
Like I was actually working

304
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,959
as a patent attorney.

305
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,520
I'd taken the patent bar

306
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:51,439
and helping a friend

307
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,199
in a right path

308
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,760
to make money on the side

309
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,600
as a side hustle.

310
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,759
I actually I ended up

311
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,679
working for a startup

312
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,159
that one of my professors at Stanford,

313
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,639
Dr. Professor Prabhakar Raghavan,

314
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,079
who's now

315
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,399
a very important person at Google.

316
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,159
He said I was taking

317
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,399
his information retrieval class

318
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,359
and then he pulled me aside after

319
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,879
basically the end of the class and said,

320
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,279
"Hey, I'm doing the startup

321
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,719
that I'm an adviser of.

322
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,759
Would you join us? "

323
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,999
So, I joined it as one of the

324
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,239
sort of the founding engineers.

325
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,159
Of course, that's what happens at Stanford.

326
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,559
Yeah.

327
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,491
It's a very common story at Stanford.

328
00:09:28,492 --> 00:09:29,599
That startup,

329
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,879
years later, gets acquired by Facebook.

330
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,599
I also had

331
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,799
sort of did a project with somebody

332
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,759
called ClickTV,

333
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,039
that was like a video search engine

334
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,960
that then we later sold to Cisco.

335
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:42,599
Right.

336
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,799
So, I had a couple of acquisitions

337
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,039
under my belt.

338
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,999
And I had worked as

339
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,039
a consulting scientist at Yahoo!

340
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,159
on their search,

341
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,999
and on eBay on their search.

342
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,039
So, the trend here is I got a lot

343
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,159
of experience in building

344
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,160
a search engine like from scratch.

345
00:09:58,357 --> 00:09:59,359
And these connections

346
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,319
sort of paid off later.

347
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,159
Like eBay, became

348
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,599
one of the first customers of Diffbot.

349
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,200
There's actually

350
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,359
a group on eBay in Israel called

351
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,199
the Structured Data Group

352
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,960
that uses Diffbot.

353
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,919
I'm good friends with that group.

354
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,519
I worked with eBay closely

355
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,839
on some projects that I did

356
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,119
in my transition between

357
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,119
high school and the army.

358
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,239
And it's a really fantastic team.

359
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,519
Yeah. They were a user of Diffbot

360
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,159
and then some of those engineers there

361
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,799
basically, Diffbot replaced their work

362
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,199
and then later we hired them

363
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,199
to join Diffbot from

364
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,680
one of the guys from eBay Isreal.

365
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:36,119
Fantastic. Fantastic.

366
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,279
So, what is Diffbot?

367
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,719
And I'd love to spend some time

368
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,239
hearing another

369
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,679
amazing Founders' story.

370
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,439
So, taking things through your

371
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:46,759
like, you know,

372
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,159
the personal journey that you're like,

373
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,919
you know, from deciding to run a company,

374
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,119
what are some of the biggest hurdles

375
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,479
that you're going through along?

376
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,519
What are some of the most

377
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,239
enjoyable moments

378
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,200
of creating this company?

379
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,640
Okay, so the first question,

380
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,360
what is Diffbot?

381
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,200
So, basically, Diffbot is

382
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,680
a search engine.

383
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,120
Now, how it differs from Google,

384
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,160
how it's the same as Google

385
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:08,359
is that we crawl the web, right?

386
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,639
So we visit all

387
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,800
the pages of the Web.

388
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,160
We actually render each page

389
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:13,399
in a real Web browser

390
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,119
so that our AI can see

391
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,399
the page just like a human does,

392
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,239
it can see the actual pixels,

393
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,559
the look of the page.

394
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,719
So, more than just a text of the page.

395
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,799
And then what we do is

396
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,799
how the AI comes into play is,

397
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,080
on every page on the Web

398
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,720
we're able to classify that page

399
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,040
into what type of page is it.

400
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,160
Is it as a person page,

401
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,880
is it an organization page,

402
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,920
is it a product page,

403
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,600
is it an image page.

404
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,360
And we're able

405
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,640
to automatically convert

406
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,560
this into structured information.

407
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:38,720
Right?

408
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,920
So, like a structured record

409
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,240
about a person, place or thing.

410
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,360
And then what we build is

411
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,960
what we call the knowledge graph,

412
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,560
which is essentially

413
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:47,759
a structured database.

414
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,280
Right?

415
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,280
So how it differs when you

416
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,240
use Google, for example,

417
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,920
what Google is,

418
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
as type in a query

419
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,960
and then Google gives

420
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,000
you back a sorted list of results.

421
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,200
Right.

422
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,040
So, Google is similar

423
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,960
to a card catalog in a library

424
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,200
where it's directing you

425
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,840
to other pages to read.

426
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,080
Right?

427
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,040
And then Google's business model

428
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,920
is to auction off

429
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,840
basically your attention

430
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,920
to the highest bidder

431
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,440
and advertisers.

432
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,360
There's a trade off, I guess,

433
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,440
between relevance and advertising.

434
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,560
Right?

435
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,120
And then Google doesn't

436
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,480
actually contain the knowledge.

437
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,680
It's actually just routing you

438
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,960
to Web pages, which you read,

439
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,080
and then you gain knowledge

440
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,600
reading those results.

441
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,280
Diffbot is actually doing

442
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,880
the reading of those Web pages,

443
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
you know, using our AI,

444
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,400
assembling it into this

445
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,760
structured data set,

446
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
and then returning back

447
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,320
those facts directly

448
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,360
from our index.

449
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,520
And so the reason Diffbot is useful,

450
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,240
especially for people building

451
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,720
applications and businesses,

452
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,360
is if you're building an app,

453
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,040
let's say you cannot just

454
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,200
directly access a search engine.

455
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,280
You need structure data

456
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,360
to show in your app,

457
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:50,399
to use it in your app.

458
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,119
Right?

459
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,839
So, for example,

460
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,799
like Snapchat is one

461
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,959
of the customers of Diffbot.

462
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
We power like the stories feature

463
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,680
those articles,

464
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,000
news stories inside Snapchat.

465
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,480
We also power other search engines

466
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,600
like DuckDuckGo.

467
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,160
When you see like

468
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,320
those news titles

469
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,120
or organization titles.

470
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,800
If you are like a business

471
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,040
that has like a CRM,

472
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,200
we can actually

473
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,680
take every record in your CRM

474
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,360
and automatically enrich and enhance it

475
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,760
using the information we have,

476
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,400
the knowledge graph.

477
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,519
So think of it almost like,

478
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,559
you know, like a professional

479
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,519
search engine that

480
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,079
a business application can use.

481
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,320
Right?

482
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,799
All of your other business tools

483
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,999
that you use are not generally

484
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,839
like ad supported software.

485
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,479
That's like consumer software.

486
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,799
Like your Microsoft Word

487
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,160
or Zoom doesn't have like

488
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,640
pop up button inside it.

489
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,560
That's how it's like supported.

490
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,200
How do you get

491
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,087
to the realization that

492
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,040
this is even something that's needed?

493
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,320
So, you know, if I were to,

494
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,440
even as I am studying

495
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,800
artificial intelligence at Stanford

496
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,160
and I'm working on a lot

497
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,760
of these questions,

498
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,080
I would never imagine,

499
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,400
like maybe I should build

500
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,600
a competitive search engine

501
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,280
that could create structured

502
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,120
data out of the World Wide Web.

503
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,200
Well, so, you study AI so,

504
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,280
you know, there's basically

505
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,080
like three drivers,

506
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,920
right of improving AI performance.

507
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,480
There's the hardware,

508
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,960
the software and then the data.

509
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:16,160
Right?

510
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,079
So, I realized early on

511
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,239
that the hardware,

512
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,840
I can never really compete there.

513
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,160
I'm not going

514
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,440
to compete against Intel

515
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,120
or TSMC or Samsung

516
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,320
and come up with better hardware.

517
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:26,479
Right?

518
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,199
Nvidia. There's already billions

519
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,640
of dollars invested in that area.

520
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,800
Right.

521
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,040
The software, well,

522
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,120
I was trying to compete in that

523
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,680
in grad school,

524
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,840
developing new algorithms.

525
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,280
Right?

526
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,000
But then there's

527
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,600
like Google tensor flow.

528
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,880
There is Pytorch, there's all this,

529
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:41,239
the software is always getting better.

530
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,520
And there's so many people

531
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,720
coming up with better algorithms

532
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,040
all the time as well.

533
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,680
Right?

534
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,280
But when you start to think about data

535
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
and you want to build

536
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,840
an intelligence system,

537
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:51,279
you need structure data.

538
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,240
Well, what does everyone do?

539
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,680
They end up

540
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:54,159
just collecting their own data.

541
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,400
They end up just

542
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,520
kind of rolling their own

543
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,560
for their own application

544
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,160
using the data they have.

545
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,320
There isn't really like

546
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,680
a kind of a knowledge store

547
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,640
where you could just kind of say,

548
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,840
I want to import this data

549
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,960
from the source.

550
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,840
And I have a core set of people,

551
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,800
organizations or articles

552
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,880
or information to start out with

553
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:14,640
that I can tap into.

554
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,119
And so that's an area where I

555
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,040
saw there is actually a gap.

556
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,520
And looking at things like image net,

557
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,120
you can see that

558
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,480
it was actually this data set

559
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,440
that resulted in this new

560
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,560
revolution and deep learning.

561
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:27,719
It wasn't actually any novel,

562
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,160
new algorithm that was invented.

563
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,920
Because neural networks

564
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,600
have been around

565
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,600
since at least the 60s and 70s.

566
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,439
So, it's when I realized,

567
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,599
hey, why can't we build

568
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,640
like an everything store of data

569
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,680
and structure the world's knowledge

570
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,640
and build like

571
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,960
a new kind of search engine

572
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,800
for these intelligent

573
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,040
applications can use.

574
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,240
Right. So, share with me,

575
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,200
let's say a use case

576
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,360
that I'm building application

577
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,640
that has something to do with sports.

578
00:15:59,641 --> 00:15:59,999
Right?

579
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
Let's say that I'm

580
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,040
that I'm dealing a lot with

581
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,120
the FIFA soccer tournament

582
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:06,079
or with the NFL

583
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,360
and I want to make use

584
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,400
of this knowledge database

585
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:12,839
that you're accumulating

586
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,679
by taking the World Wide Web

587
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,480
and tape making it

588
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,440
into structured data,

589
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,320
how would that used case look like

590
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,960
from your perspective,

591
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,480
if I were to want to

592
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,640
use Diffbot for example?

593
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,720
Yeah. So, I can show you an example.

594
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,360
Amazing.

595
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,680
So, with sports,

596
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,360
one of our customers is called

597
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,800
Sports Innovation Lab.

598
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,920
And what they do is basically

599
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,520
they produce business intelligence

600
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,880
for owners of sports teams

601
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:45,959
and sports executives.

602
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,639
So, they're using

603
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,559
the Diffbot knowledge graph

604
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,639
in order to track like

605
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,880
what's developing all these

606
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,680
events in the sports world.

607
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,000
Sure.

608
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,080
The players, the teams,

609
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,119
they're using it to track like,

610
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,400
which teams have covid,

611
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,000
which teams are shutting down,

612
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,520
how are things like re-openings.

613
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,080
So, it's helping sports executives

614
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,320
really navigate sort of the re-opening

615
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,600
like post covid.

616
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,240
And so, they're using

617
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:08,719
the knowledge graph

618
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,919
to keep track of all these things.

619
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,039
Right? Because,

620
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,279
it seems like things are changing

621
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,519
in the news on a daily basis

622
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,039
with each team

623
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,159
and each player.

624
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,919
It's too much for like

625
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,159
a human to keep track of.

626
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,879
Our AI is actually we crawl the web

627
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,839
keeping track of all that,

628
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,800
presenting the API dashboard for them.

629
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:25,591
We're going to put a box

630
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:26,719
right above your head

631
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,639
of how it's going to look.

632
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,399
So, how does a company like

633
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,880
that interact with Diffbot

634
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,559
on their day to day

635
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,879
both on the application level,

636
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,679
but also on the consumer level?

637
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,679
Yeah. I shared with you

638
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,080
a link to basically

639
00:17:44,014 --> 00:17:46,039
how it looks like to the end user.

640
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,760
But you can see basically

641
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,559
there's this dashboard

642
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,279
that shows a visualization

643
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,280
across time of various sporting

644
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,479
world related events, you know,

645
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,120
as it relates to covid and sports.

646
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,040
And so you can see

647
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,200
it's sort of curated

648
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,960
by the team on each team.

649
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:11,439
It shows like, you know,

650
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,679
when that seat,

651
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,199
that league was postponed,

652
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,319
when it reopens,

653
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,319
like athlete data,

654
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,200
like whether a player has covid.

655
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,640
Wow.

656
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,199
That's very, very cool.

657
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,159
What was the most surprising part

658
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,240
of the start of journey for you until now?

659
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,839
I mean, startup Journey has so many

660
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,400
surprises in it, I guess.

661
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,719
With Diffbot, I'm surprised

662
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,119
by different use cases of

663
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,600
our technology out all the time.

664
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,280
Right?

665
00:18:49,281 --> 00:18:51,479
Every day you hear about

666
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,159
one of our customers

667
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,880
using it in a way

668
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,760
that you didn't expect

669
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,640
the technology to be used in.

670
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,200
So, I think that's

671
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,560
one cool thing about building like

672
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,240
a platforms kind of company,

673
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:02,719
is that the

674
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,199
people are free to use it in lots

675
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,199
of different ways that you

676
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,199
wouldn't have imagined.

677
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,559
And so it creates more innovation.

678
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,359
100%.

679
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,519
It also requires some

680
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,040
open mindedness and some creativity.

681
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,800
And you're going to accept it

682
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:14,759
and to roll along

683
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,519
with that understanding

684
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,279
that you're seeing these

685
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,880
radically new use cases

686
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,800
that you didn't expect,

687
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,720
but you're embracing them

688
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,960
and now you're able

689
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,360
to understand the magnitude

690
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,360
of what you're building

691
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,080
Mike, this was really wonderful.

692
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,440
And I love what you're doing.

693
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:28,599
I know that you're also hiring.

694
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,559
So, I'm guessing that

695
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,160
if anybody here

696
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,440
is into this kind of stuff

697
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,320
and would like to reach out,

698
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:36,079
I can make the intro.

699
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,920
That's okay with you?

700
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,480
Yeah, definitely.

701
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,840
We're probably the best place

702
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,920
in the world if you care

703
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,040
about building automatic

704
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,599
knowledge graphs using AI

705
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,999
right from the whole web.

706
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,199
Besides Google and Bing,

707
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,759
we are the only

708
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,159
other US entity that crawls

709
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,000
the entire Internet.

710
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,280
So, we have our own facility here

711
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,880
in the Bay Area

712
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,680
that crawls the web and has a copy of it.

713
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,040
Unbelievable.

714
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,480
How many people

715
00:19:55,481 --> 00:19:57,480
are in the company right now?

716
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,879
We're a little less than

717
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,119
40 people right now.

718
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,440
Wow.

719
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,239
That's very, very impressive.

720
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,959
It's mind boggling to me.

721
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,079
A team of less than 40 people

722
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,999
making sense of the entire Internet,

723
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,639
crawling the entire Internet.

724
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,240
That's just you know,

725
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,120
it was unbelievable

726
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,920
when Larry and Sergey attempted

727
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:17,239
to do it in 1998,

728
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,039
when the Internet was this small.

729
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,840
It's even more impressive

730
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,320
when you're trying to do

731
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:21,879
when the Internet is this big.

732
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,800
Mike, before we leave,

733
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,160
I have to ask you for three words

734
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,640
that you would use to describe yourself.

735
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,640
This is a tough question

736
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,600
to reduce, like a human

737
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,880
just to like three bits.

738
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:34,160
But I would say

739
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:36,199
if I were to only choose three words

740
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,800
in my entry into

741
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,640
Diffbot knowledge graph,

742
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,200
it would probably be

743
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,280
machine learning engineer.

744
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,360
Because that probably

745
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,840
most describes what I do,

746
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:44,919
like engineering machine

747
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,800
learning systems,

748
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:49,999
and that describes the core of

749
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
what I do as a CEO.

750
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,759
I love that.

751
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,159
Mike, thank you very, very much.

752
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,119
And this was really great.

753
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,719
I learned a lot.

754
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,039
Thank you for being so generous

755
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,999
with your time

756
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,863
and best of luck.

757
00:20:59,063 --> 00:21:01,200
And stay safe and stay healthy.

758
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,520
Great. Thanks for having me, Michael.
