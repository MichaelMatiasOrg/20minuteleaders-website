1
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,240
Wonderful.

2
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,720
Josh Becker, thank you for joining me

3
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,400
on 20 Minute Leaders.

4
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,720
How are you?

5
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,320
I'm very good.

6
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,200
Thank you for having me.

7
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,440
Thank you for taking the time to do this.

8
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,240
I know you just got back

9
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,960
from a long trip.

10
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
So I really appreciate it

11
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,840
and I know how busy you are.

12
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,760
Brief background

13
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,240
and then I'm gonna ask so many questions

14
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,360
because I know so little about the things

15
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,840
that you do.

16
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,480
The scope of the things that you do

17
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,920
but they're so fascinating.

18
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,800
So Stanford Business School,

19
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,400
but also a law degree from Stanford.

20
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,240
Always thinking about

21
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,280
public interest entrepreneurship.

22
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,320
What does that even mean?

23
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,400
I can sense by the name,

24
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,360
but I don't really know.

25
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,200
The Full Circle Fund,

26
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,680
helping non-profits.

27
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
I think you've deployed over

28
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,840
a 100,000 hours of help

29
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,880
through that. Incredible.

30
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,720
And you're running

31
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,240
for state Senate this year,

32
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,880
which I also I'm excited to learn about

33
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,680
what that transformation is like

34
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,760
and what it means to innovate

35
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,320
within government.

36
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,760
Okay, let's take a break now.

37
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,760
Josh, tell me who you are, please.

38
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,680
Well, thanks. Yeah, this is really fun.

39
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,200
I really appreciate you having me.

40
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,400
Yeah and thinking about it

41
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,440
I mean, there are things

42
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,920
that run through all of that.

43
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,360
And for me, it really is innovation.

44
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,280
I love innovation in any respect.

45
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,400
So, whether in the private sector,

46
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,560
in the nonprofit sector,

47
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,120
or now

48
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,360
in the government sector.

49
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,040
And for me there's really been a theme.

50
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,480
I actually started out more

51
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,760
on a public policy basis.

52
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,320
I mean out of undergrad,

53
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,800
I was really focused on environment.

54
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,960
Environmental activism.

55
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,280
Went to DC.

56
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,480
Worked in policy.

57
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,600
Worked at some campaigns.

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
And it was almost a fluke, really,

59
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,640
that I ended up in business school.

60
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,880
But in the in-between time,

61
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,320
I applied and I came out,

62
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,920
I got involved with a guy named

63
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,760
Jack Hidary starting

64
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,120
early Internet company called Earth Web.

65
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,400
And this was 1994, early days of the web.

66
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,440
Bringing a physical computer over

67
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,680
to the Metropolitan Museum of Art,

68
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
showing them the Web saying,

69
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,640
"Hey we'll build a website for you."

70
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,560
And I got really involved.

71
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,040
By the time

72
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,360
I came out to Stanford in 1995.

73
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,600
It's like, wow, this is really

74
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
a great place to be.

75
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,840
And so, I got really into innovation

76
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,720
in the private sector

77
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,840
in the early Internet days

78
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,280
and ultimately in clean tech.

79
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,880
And it became to see a way to really meld

80
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,960
my common interests

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,400
in the public good with innovation.

82
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,480
And I did it both in what

83
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,880
we call impact investing

84
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,560
and this was the really early days.

85
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,680
We started a fund in

86
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,560
the impact investing space

87
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,720
which actually is now growing.

88
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,400
And we're focusing on businesses

89
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,560
that had a real social impact.

90
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,000
So, clean energy was one of them.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,120
Wow. But that's pretty, you know, I go to quite a few

92
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,400
of the classes at the business school

93
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,680
and a lot of my friends

94
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,240
are at the Stanford Business School.

95
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,720
It's pretty rare that somebody

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,720
comes in there and goes out of there

97
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,040
with the sense of responsibility of

98
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,560
devoting most of their time

99
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,080
to doing social good.

100
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,480
I mean, there is a trend

101
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,280
and a lot of people are saying,

102
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,320
"Yes, I want my business

103
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,120
to do social good."

104
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:09,920
But you're saying

105
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,120
it's about the social good.

106
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
It's not about necessarily

107
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,160
just the business.

108
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,320
The social good is the motivation.

109
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,760
It's not just a buy.

110
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,240
It's not just,

111
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,160
a by consequence, right?

112
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,440
Yeah, and personally

113
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,840
I see a lot of young students right now

114
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,240
that you are really interested,

115
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,560
as you say, in that intersection

116
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,680
But we were kind of on the early edge of that

117
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,280
and in fact we had our own conference we created

118
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,400
called the Zero Trade-Off

119
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,480
Investment Conference.

120
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,240
And we look at things that could actually

121
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,400
create a great financial return

122
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,600
and a great social return.

123
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,800
Right.

124
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,760
But clean energy was one of those.

125
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,600
And we got involved

126
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,840
in a company called Opower

127
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,600
that was really about using

128
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,960
social psychology to get people

129
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,640
to reduce their energy use.

130
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,640
And that ended up being a huge success.

131
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,680
And again, showed me what's possible.

132
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,120
Inner city, we've had a focus

133
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,400
on inner city and ethnic entrepreneurs.

134
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,080
So, I'm still on the board of a company

135
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,840
that's now called UR Welcome.

136
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,600
UR Welcome, with U and a R.

137
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,600
And it's kind of like USAA for immigrants.

138
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,400
And then we had inner city

139
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,600
something called the Villa,

140
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,760
which was an inner city shoe store

141
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,440
really got ...

142
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,560
parents' sneaker store

143
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,640
and started opening up the inner city

144
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,360
and building work skills and life skills.

145
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,040
And so a number of those things.

146
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,960
And then Full Circle Fund,

147
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,480
I realized so many of my friends

148
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,360
from business school and law school

149
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,200
that did have a really deep interest

150
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,400
in doing good in the world,

151
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,240
but they were busy.

152
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,800
Everyone's you know,

153
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
you're busy with your lives,

154
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,480
your work, your kids.

155
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,160
And so, we said,

156
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,040
"Let's pool together

157
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,840
our time and our money."

158
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,880
And that was Full Circle Fund

159
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,760
and we started that actually

160
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,040
this is almost exactly 20 years ago.

161
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,040
This our 20th anniversary year.

162
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,720
Wow.

163
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,000
And it's just that way I found,

164
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,880
like you see some books behind me,

165
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,120
I find when I'm part of a book club,

166
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,880
I read more books.

167
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,960
So, when I'm part of something like

168
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,600
Full Circle, I ended up giving more

169
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,440
because you build a social

170
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,880
community around giving.

171
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,360
And it's also, it's available.

172
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,680
So I mean, right now,

173
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,640
a lot of this idea of you wanna get

174
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,880
something done

175
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,520
I love behavioral economics

176
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,960
and when you talk about the social psychology

177
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,520
of reducing energy.

178
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,880
So Dan Ariely is a big mentor of mine.

179
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,560
And one of the things that

180
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,200
I was always inspired by him was he says,

181
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,640
Listen, we're irrational people.

182
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,440
It's really hard to change ourselves,

183
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,120
but if we can change our environment

184
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,520
to fit what we want to achieve,

185
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,440
like joining a book club

186
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,120
and then you're systematically forced

187
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,880
to read a book.

188
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,280
Or joining the Full Circle Fund

189
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,720
and now you have the accessibility

190
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
to go and help others.

191
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
I think that's marvelous.

192
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,960
Josh, tell me a little bit about this

193
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,400
innovation in government

194
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,320
because I wanna make sure

195
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,200
we leave enough time for this

196
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,680
because I think it's fascinating.

197
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,440
You're running for Senate.

198
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,480
How do you do this transition

199
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,520
from entrepreneur investor to government?

200
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,280
What motivates you to do that?

201
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,260
Sure. I proabably have Dan Ariely's book

202
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,080
right behind me.

203
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,880
Wonderful.

204
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,360
Yeah. I think you look and see where

205
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,840
you can have the biggest impact.

206
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,920
And when I started really focusing

207
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,600
on the state of California and realizing

208
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,060
we have a

209
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,880
two hundred billion dollar budget

210
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,720
If it were our own country, we'd

211
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,800
be the fifth or sixth largest

212
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,280
economy in the world.

213
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,920
And there's really not that

214
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,920
many state senators.

215
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,320
There's 40 state senators.

216
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,360
And probably five to 10 of those 40

217
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,160
who are really probably the most influential.

218
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,720
And then saw, began to see that

219
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,000
as an opportunity for change.

220
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,600
Essentially this is the board of directors

221
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,160
for the state of California,

222
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,800
the United States Senate,

223
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,440
and the state House.

224
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,960
And the more I started to focus on that

225
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,640
... this is a real opportunity.

226
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,880
And listen, I'm sure

227
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,080
and I ... friends up there now, and

228
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,960
it is still 40 in the Senate,

229
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,680
80 in the House,

230
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,400
so it's still 120 people still,

231
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,200
I'm sure it's ... bureaucratic at times.

232
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,760
But when you look at the opportunity

233
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,760
for leverage, I think it's tremendous.

234
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,480
And whether it's meeting

235
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,640
our clean energy goals.

236
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,240
We're, California,

237
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,880
I think it's the hope,

238
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,920
certainly for the US

239
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,560
and one of the big hopes for the world.

240
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,880
And by the way I'm really excited

241
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,720
about collaboration,

242
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,200
as I've done in my past life

243
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,520
about collaborating with Israel

244
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,200
and the amazing technology around water.

245
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,320
Totally.

246
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,920
And around solar, around storage

247
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
that's coming out of Israel.

248
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,720
I'm really looking forward

249
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,120
to collaborating there.

250
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,880
So, whether it's clean energy,

251
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,240
whether it was focusing on social justice

252
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,520
and criminal justice reform,

253
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,200
that California was this

254
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,040
huge leverage point.

255
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,080
And I got really excited about that.

256
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,040
And that's what I'm going up there to do.

257
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,800
That's incredible.

258
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,240
So and is this like a spontaneous gut feeling

259
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,920
that you have to do this?

260
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,840
Or is this something that you feel

261
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,360
like you've worked towards for years?

262
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,320
Which of these two?

263
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,720
It's a little bit of both to be honest.

264
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
I mean, like I said, I started out in DC

265
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,080
before I came out to Stanford

266
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,760
and business school, law school.

267
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,600
I was already focused on policy.

268
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,920
So it's not like a brand new,

269
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,360
like I woke up one day and decided

270
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,520
I had to do it.

271
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,240
So I'd say it was more of an evolution

272
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,120
in terms of really

273
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,840
I never thought I would personally run.

274
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,000
That's something I never thought

275
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,840
for sure would ever happen.

276
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,840
So, but I was always very interested

277
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,920
in policy

278
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,640
maybe more so

279
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,280
than other kids or other young adults.

280
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,600
So I'd say it's a bit of an evolution.

281
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,760
Right. And I mean,

282
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,800
you're gonna come there.

283
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,720
I don't know how many people

284
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,200
that are Senators have a background,

285
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,040
this entrepreneurial and innovative

286
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,480
background that you have.

287
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,000
Do you think that's gonna be a challenge?

288
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,360
Or is that going to be a fun experience

289
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,527
being sort of the odd one out?

290
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:44,120
I think it'll be a little bit of both.

291
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,880
I'm sure it'll be some

292
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,760
eye opening situations.

293
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,840
So I think it'll be a little bit of both,

294
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,640
but I am really excited about it.

295
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,240
And hopefully people

296
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,920
will turn to me on certain issues

297
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,760
and look at me whether

298
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,840
I've got some degree of expertise

299
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,760
to bring.

300
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,560
But at the same time,

301
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,720
I need to be humble as well

302
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,880
and realize there's a lot I have to learn

303
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,720
about the state of California,

304
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,640
I'm already starting now,

305
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,320
but it's such a massive state

306
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,240
with its agricultural economy,

307
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,160
the Hollywood economy,

308
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,440
the tech economy.

309
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,520
There's just so much to learn.

310
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,920
Like I said, I just got back from this trip

311
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
all the way down the eastern Sierras

312
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,840
all the way to Death Valley.

313
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,600
It's a really incredibly diverse state

314
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,480
so I've got a lot to learn as well.

315
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,600
I think it's unbelievable.

316
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,680
But the perception of young entrepreneurs

317
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,040
like myself when we think of

318
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
government, senator, congressmen,

319
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,400
we look back at these funny videos

320
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,360
with Zuckerberg

321
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,920
sitting in front of Congress

322
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,760
and they're asking him,

323
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,840
"Well, so how do ads work?

324
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,320
Are you tracking people

325
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,760
and are you showing them stuff

326
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,320
that they should buy?"

327
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,560
And so our perception,

328
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,800
somebody who sits in the government

329
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,680
is not necessarily the most tech savvy,

330
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,640
not necessarily the best representative

331
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,520
of where innovation takes it.

332
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,040
You're bringing

333
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,280
a different perspective to this.

334
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:59,280
So, how do you see this mishmash

335
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,120
of both bureaucracy and innovation

336
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,920
and tech and crises that are happening?

337
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,480
I mean, you really have

338
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,360
to balance everything.

339
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,280
Yeah, I think when you look

340
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,440
quick changing government,

341
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,000
and I've also done it in law by the way

342
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,840
I started a whole company. I spent

343
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,160
10 years in legal analytics.

344
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,600
We brought data and analytics to the law.

345
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,560
Which was a long, so that was the long game -

346
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
What does that mean

347
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,520
bringing data analytics to the law?

348
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,880
Yeah. In politics sometimes gotta play

349
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,400
the long game, too.

350
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,640
And thinking driving across the state.

351
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,080
I've been on the board

352
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,160
of UC Merced for 15 years.

353
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,120
That was a government decision that said

354
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,480
"Hey we need to start a new UC campus

355
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,520
in the Central Valley"

356
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,720
And first it was a 100 students

357
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,920
and now it'll be 10,000 students.

358
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,280
And my friend Jack's

359
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,480
now at Google X and so we had a

360
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,720
a call now that

361
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,000
Google is getting serious

362
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,840
about diversifying the STEM pipeline.

363
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,760
And we've got all these great diverse

364
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,160
engineering students coming

365
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,720
out of UC Merced.

366
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,840
And so, sometimes you got to,

367
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
but it took a long,

368
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,040
it didn't happen overnight.

369
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,040
But it was, people were very

370
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,400
forward thinking to say,

371
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,640
"Hey great. We need a new UC.

372
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,800
Let's put it in the Central Valley.

373
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,440
Let's encourage college attendance"

374
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,880
And so, sometimes you gotta play

375
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,000
the long game in government.

376
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,440
Jack is actually a very good friend

377
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,040
of my father's

378
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,080
and every time I meet him,

379
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,080
my mind is just blown.

380
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,880
The work they're doing there

381
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,160
on quantum computing is just phenomenal.

382
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,480
So, bringing analytics and data to legal.

383
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,640
What does that mean?

384
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,960
What did you try to do there?

385
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,280
Sure. Basically in a nutshell, we realized

386
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,200
it started really around patent,

387
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,720
some area that a lot of entrepreneurs

388
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,080
get very frustrated with the patent system.

389
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,760
And we realized there's just no data.

390
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,760
There's no data about

391
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,400
when you get hit with a patent lawsuit,

392
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,440
who is this person that sued me?

393
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,080
What's their pattern of behavior?

394
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,480
Are they looking for a quick buck

395
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,200
or is this a serious company

396
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,600
that takes things all the way?

397
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,680
And they've got a serious claim here.

398
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,080
There's really, there was no data.

399
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,480
No data about judges.

400
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,000
Who's this judge I'm in front of?

401
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,640
What is their, what is her pattern of behavior?

402
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,360
And so we realized this endemic in law.

403
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,280
There's just no data.

404
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,440
And so we said that data

405
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,320
is actually out there

406
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,160
it's just buried in millions of lawsuits.

407
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,080
So, we said,

408
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,120
"Hey, we can extract out

409
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,280
the millions of data points

410
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,840
from millions of cases"

411
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,080
Then we could tell you

412
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,240
if you're in front of certain judge.

413
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:13,600
We can say,

414
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,760
"Hey, in the last thousand cases

415
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,000
of this type in front of this judge,

416
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:18,960
here's the lawyers

417
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,280
that have the most experience

418
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,440
through the years who've won the most motions.

419
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,080
Here's a strategy

420
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,240
you might think about pursuing.

421
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,760
And here's how this judge

422
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,820
has ruled on these kinds of cases"

423
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,560
I mean, I think I kind of blindly assumed

424
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,800
that this is how a lot of these law firms

425
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,360
work today.

426
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,960
That when they're advising on a case,

427
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,600
that they're able to look back at thousands

428
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,200
of other similar cases

429
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,240
because history repeats itself constantly

430
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,080
and be able to give those insights.

431
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,520
You're saying that

432
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,160
that's not really the case?

433
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,120
Well, I know a lot of brilliant lawyers,

434
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,520
but you can't keep 3000 cases in your head.

435
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,720
I mean, it's been the ultimate

436
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,440
anecdata business, right?

437
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,560
It's like, "Oh, yeah, I had this case

438
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,760
in front of this judge.

439
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,600
And I remember this"

440
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,200
I love that, anecdata.

441
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,600
I've never heard that before.

442
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,340
I'm gonna start using that.

443
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,120
... anecdotes it's anecdata.

444
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,520
And that's really what it's been.

445
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,200
It's all reputation based too.

446
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,960
"Oh, this law firm's

447
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,000
got a great reputation"

448
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,240
"I need a great lawyer.

449
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,840
Oh you gotta talk to Lisa"

450
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,720
But really, there's just no data behind it.

451
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,320
I mean, it's like VC too, frankly.

452
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,880
You always put your wins.

453
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,480
If you go to any VC website,

454
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,200
they're gonna say,

455
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,280
"Oh, look at all our great exits."

456
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,960
They don't say,

457
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,440
"Oh, here's the other 100 companies

458
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,520
we invested in that didn't make it" Right?
- 100%

459
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,520
I mean, now with

460
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,040
Now people have gotten a little more data there,

461
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,160
but that was also a data void.

462
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,080
Interesting. And so when was this

463
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,440
that you started this firm?

464
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
So, this is actually

465
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,840
it was a public interest project

466
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,320
at Stanford Law.

467
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,400
And what was amazing,

468
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,720
you probably know Andrew Ng.

469
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,600
Of course.

470
00:15:48,601 --> 00:15:49,320
Google day

471
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,040
So, Andrew, when he was

472
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,480
still full time at Stanford

473
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,640
and then Chris Manning,

474
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,320
who runs Natural Language Processing.

475
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,600
Yeah.

476
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,040
The founders of this

477
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,920
public interest project

478
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,000
went to Andrew and Chris and said,

479
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,720
"Will you help us?"

480
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,560
And they first said No

481
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,320
'cause they're very busy.

482
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,000
And then ultimately they said,

483
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,760
"Hey, this is good for the country."

484
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,720
And they got involved

485
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,680
and they got excited about,

486
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,000
specially Chris,

487
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,800
you know natural language processing.

488
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,520
So, I was very fortunate,

489
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,320
this was way before I was involved. This

490
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,800
back in 2006, 2007.

491
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,040
And then it spun off as

492
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,960
a public interest project in late 2010.

493
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,400
They brought me in 2011 to grow it.

494
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,680
So, but it still took nine years.

495
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,840
Now, it's part of LexisNexis and it's growing.

496
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,960
We just passed three million cases

497
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,080
that are now in the system.

498
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,160
We just added a whole new area of law.

499
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,520
We're starting to add states now

500
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,680
because so much of what happens

501
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,280
is at the state level,

502
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,160
and that's even much much harder place

503
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,600
to even get the raw materials

504
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,320
'cause most states

505
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,600
don't even have electronic court records.

506
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,840
So, anyway it's been the long game,

507
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,600
the long journey

508
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,840
but it's really transforming

509
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,000
the way law is practice.

510
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,160
So, you worked on projects

511
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,600
with Jack Hidary.

512
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,040
This project was had involvement

513
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,240
with Andrew Ng and Chris.

514
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,560
I mean, these are just

515
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,080
the top of the top of the top

516
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,280
of the world thinkers.

517
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,120
So I think that's just incredible.

518
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,320
What are you most excited

519
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,720
about moving forward?

520
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,000
And actually right before that,

521
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,440
the election, how does it even work?

522
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,960
What do you have to do?

523
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,520
Because a lot of the times

524
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,040
when people in tech,

525
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,680
they're thinking of politicians

526
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,080
and the elections,

527
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,880
it almost seems like,

528
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,070
"Oh yeah, he asked to go do that.

529
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,000
He has to go talk.

530
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,040
He can't just do"

531
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,360
Talk to me a little bit

532
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,200
about this election process.

533
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,280
Sure. One thing I'll just say,

534
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,480
because a lot of people

535
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,790
who are entrepreneurs come in,

536
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,200
they think they can just waltz in

537
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,680
to the political system,

538
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,880
and it doesn't work that way.

539
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,830
You really have to become

540
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,680
part of the ecosystem.

541
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,110
You have to really get to know

542
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,360
all the players.

543
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,760
And Woody Allen used to say

544
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,680
"98% of life is just showing up"

545
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,040
You really have to show up at all

546
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,800
the local Democratic clubs

547
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,320
and all the local meetings

548
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,600
and really get to know people.

549
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,360
You cannot just waltz in and say,

550
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,790
"Hey, I'm gonna run for this thing."

551
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,270
It's just it's a very different

552
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,160
The world's even here in

553
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,560
Silicon valley are just not connected.

554
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:06,680
People, in fact it can also be a negative

555
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,640
in some ways.

556
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,960
So you really, so I really put

557
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,160
in many years of hard work

558
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,920
and fund work.

559
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,800
But hard work at the local level

560
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,840
and just getting to know people

561
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,640
and spent 18 months before the primary

562
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,510
just on this race alone.

563
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,080
So, 'cause we have twenty four cities

564
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,310
in my district

565
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,160
and it spans all of Silicon Valley

566
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,000
from South San Francisco

567
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,920
down to Sunnyvale.

568
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,320
And each one has city council members,

569
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,680
each has school board members,

570
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,480
there's county officials and

571
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,750
they're doing hard work for many years.

572
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,830
And you got to understand that.

573
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,880
So, you really have to put in the time

574
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,400
and I'm proud that I did that.

575
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,320
Finished first in the primary.

576
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,120
We have in California a great system,

577
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,480
a top two system.

578
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,560
So, basically the top two

579
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,480
vote getters advance.

580
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,400
And what that means is, usually,

581
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,520
you actually have two Democrats

582
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,560
in this area so people then get

583
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,480
to choose between a flavor of Democrat.

584
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,240
Or in Orange County

585
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,790
you might have two Republicans.

586
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,680
Actually, in my race, I did very well

587
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,760
and there was a lot of other Democrats.

588
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,750
So it ended up being me and a Republican

589
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,590
that we'll be facing off in November.
So we have the top two primaries -

590
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,560
For the whole state?

591
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,360
What'd you say?

592
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,590
That's gonna be for the whole state?

593
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,680
No. This is our district.

594
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,880
So, each state senate district

595
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,000
is about a million people.

596
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,520
So, our district is from everything, basically

597
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,320
everything from the border

598
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,590
of San Francisco down to Sunnyvale.

599
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,590
Okay.

600
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,240
So, I get the Israeli Kibbutz

601
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,750
in Sunnyvale as part of my -

602
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,520
100%. I had a talk with the

603
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,640
mayor of Sunnyvale back then,

604
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,030
Larry, about back in,

605
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,880
what was it?

606
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,590
I think two, three months ago.

607
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,200
And then halfway through the talk,

608
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,000
he mentioned that he's also

609
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,830
a program manager at a startup,

610
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,110
at a battery startup.

611
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,240
And I thought it was just,

612
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,240
it was hilarious that

613
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,840
I'm talking to a mayor of a city.

614
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,270
In Israel, you never have that.

615
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,510
So I think it was just phenomenal.

616
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,760
And what are you most excited about

617
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,280
the next few years, potentially

618
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,270
serving as a senator?

619
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,240
Yeah. I'm very excited about

620
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,080
the opportunity to make change in areas

621
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,160
that we've  talked about.

622
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:08,960
Clean energy.

623
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,640
Got to lead the world.

624
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,360
Criminal justice reform.

625
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,880
Education.

626
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,640
Higher education.

627
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,720
We need three more

628
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,840
UC Merceds in this state.

629
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,830
More access for kids.

630
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,560
Those are just a few of the areas,

631
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,760
but I'm really excited

632
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,800
about the opportunity to lead

633
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,040
in all those. Build a world class

634
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,440
transportation system here,

635
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,400
especially in the Bay Area.

636
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,920
I just got off a call on that.

637
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,760
So, those are some things I'm

638
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,030
really passionate about.

639
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,920
And now looking at this

640
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,110
crisis that we're facing globally

641
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,160
and you're at the intersection

642
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,960
of both innovation and government,

643
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,750
so, you're getting the flavor of both.

644
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,400
In your take,

645
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,030
where are we headed with this?

646
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,400
And what are the things to be either

647
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,440
optimistic about or pessimistic about?

648
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,560
Well, I think there's

649
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,640
reason to be optimistic

650
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:58,070
and we've seen even through this pandemic

651
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,720
both how communities have rallied.

652
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,160
I mean, certainly in the US we have some

653
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,040
divisiveness and polarization right now

654
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,550
that we need to get through.

655
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,760
But you've also seen there's a lot

656
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,680
of great stories about

657
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,440
neighbors helping neighbors.

658
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,160
And innovation, whether people

659
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,760
how they're running

660
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,360
their small businesses differently.

661
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,040
How cities are opening

662
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,590
up streets for restaurants or how,

663
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,110
I just got email today.

664
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,680
... looked at a guy,

665
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,720
"Hey, I'm leaving Samsung

666
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,040
to lead this covid-related company."

667
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,000
And was like, "Wow that's really cool."

668
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,680
So I mean there's a lot of people

669
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,200
doing really cool work

670
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,240
and it's gonna

671
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,120
and biotech is also an area

672
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,160
I spend a lot of time on now

673
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,160
especially in oncology.

674
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,160
And to see that we will have a vaccine

675
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,110
and faster than we've ever had one before.

676
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,520
And it's not overnight

677
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,760
as these things are.

678
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,960
But we're getting there

679
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,720
and the innovation piece is critical.

680
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,400
100% Josh, thank you so much

681
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:52,760
for your time.

682
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,070
I really appreciate it.

683
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,360
Thank you for doing this

684
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,000
right after you're back from your trip.

685
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,160
Before we leave, I have to ask you

686
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,200
for three words that best describe you.

687
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,720
Thank you.

688
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,610
I would say innovative,

689
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,480
thoughtful.

690
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,280
and passionate,

691
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
Innovative. Thoughtful. Passionate.

692
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,440
And I think one of the things

693
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,160
that I'm most inspired by

694
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,040
and I'm taking a lesson for myself

695
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,790
is this persistence and consistency

696
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,440
with putting the public interests first.

697
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,240
I think it shines on all the different

698
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,400
endeavors over the past decades.

699
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:24,920
And the fact that

700
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,120
you're able to do these endeavors

701
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,280
with the greatest thought leaders

702
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,040
in the world.

703
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,400
Seriously, I mean, all the people

704
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,120
that we've talked about, I mean,

705
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,480
they're really just incredible.

706
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,080
And I'm very very excited that people

707
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,720
are now entering the politics space

708
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,550
and government with the insight

709
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,160
and the experience of what it takes

710
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,240
to bring innovation

711
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,680
And thank you very much.

712
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,920
I look forward to seeing you up there.

713
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,160
Thank you. Thanks for having me.

714
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,160
Take care. Bye bye.
