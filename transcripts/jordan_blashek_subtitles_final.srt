 1
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,440
All right.

2
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,800
Jordan Blashek, how are you?

3
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,840
Oh, I'm fantastic.

4
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,080
Thanks for having me on.

5
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,520
I already enjoyed so much

6
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,680
speaking before this

7
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,000
so I'm so excited for the show

8
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,440
and I purposely didn't ask too much

9
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,480
because I'm ready to hear now.

10
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,840
Jordan, you have such

11
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,060
an extraordinary life path.

12
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,080
From being an infantry officer,

13
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,280
to studying at Princeton,

14
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,640
Yale, and Stanford,

15
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,360
law degree and business degree

16
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,360
and I can't even grasp my mind over it.

17
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,000
You're writing a book

18
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,560
which is coming out soon,

19
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,840
but actually by the time this is aired

20
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,120
it will already be out,

21
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,040
talking about America

22
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,080
and the polarization, or hopefully

23
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,640
I hope there is some optimistic note.

24
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,400
We'll see.

25
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,520
And now at Schmidt Futures

26
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,080
and I can't wait to hear all about that.

27
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,440
And lastly, venture partner at J-Ventures

28
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,200
where I am also at.

29
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,640
So, this is just all wonderful.

30
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,320
Jordan, how do you get to go

31
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,760
to these three incredible institutions?

32
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,480
How do you get to be an infantry officer

33
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,320
in the US Army?

34
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,200
Yeah. Well, it's funny you say that.

35
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,960
Every time I talk to Israelis,

36
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,640
I feel like I am so under accomplished

37
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,160
because by the time

38
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,880
you guys even go to school,

39
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,120
you've already done so much in your lives

40
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,000
and that's true for you, too.

41
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,400
But yeah, I've had a great few years.

42
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,640
You and I have shared a lot.

43
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,400
I was the first associate at J-Ventures

44
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,840
when it was just J-Angels

45
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,120
and it was one of the best experiences

46
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,400
I've had at Stanford.

47
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,520
I have huge, huge shoes

48
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,240
to fill right now.

49
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,320
This is very scary.

50
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,920
No no no.

51
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,480
You have far surpassed me already.

52
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,160
But I guess, so my journey

53
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,640
started back in California.

54
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
I grew up in Los Angeles.

55
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
Son of two Jewish parents

56
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,040
who wanted nothing more than for me to go

57
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,360
to medical school, and I get to college.

58
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,040
I sort of, like a good Jewish boy,

59
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,760
decide I'm gonna go to medical school

60
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,720
and my junior summer,

61
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,120
I was working in medical clinics in India,

62
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,920
and just realized that I actually

63
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,000
didn't love the medicine side,

64
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,800
but I really did love being out

65
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,000
in austere environments

66
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,760
and working with local populations.

67
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,360
And so I decided coming out of that,

68
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,560
that I wanted to join the US military.

69
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,480
And after looking around,

70
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,640
I found that the Marine Corps

71
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,280
was the group that I really wanted

72
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,000
to be a part of.

73
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,480
They have such amazing esprit de corps.

74
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,510
Every Marine is so proud to be a Marine.

75
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,060
Wait wait. So remind me Jordan,

76
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,240
which of the three institutions

77
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,400
was your undergrad?

78
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,280
Oh, I went to Princeton undergrad.

79
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,960
So Princeton.

80
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,480
How common is it for somebody at Princeton

81
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,760
during their studies to decide

82
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,040
that they're going to join the US Army?

83
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,040
I think my year, we had about five of us

84
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,160
who all joined the military.

85
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,840
That's more than I thought.

86
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,160
Okay. Interesting.

87
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,640
Yeah. It was around 2009,

88
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,320
and at that point, we had watched

89
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
all these generations go off to war.

90
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,040
And I think there was a sense among

91
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,640
a lot of us, and this was true

92
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,920
across my officer cohort,

93
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,960
that there were a lot of people

94
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,480
who were just very inspired

95
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,120
over the couple years before.

96
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,840
And so, we were all very passionate

97
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,960
about serving the country.

98
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,160
We were very idealistic about it.

99
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,400
And so there was a good number who went.

100
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,880
And so I ended up joining

101
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,960
the Marines in 2009.

102
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,720
I went through officer training

103
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,720
and by the end, decided I wanted to be

104
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,600
an infantry officer.

105
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,080
So, I went to the infantry officer course

106
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,160
and then ended up doing two deployments.

107
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,160
One to the Horn of Africa

108
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
doing counter piracy

109
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,360
and counter terror missions.

110
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,720
And then another to Afghanistan,

111
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,160
where I was an adviser to the Afghan army.

112
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,240
Oh my God.

113
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,520
Okay. I need one short story,

114
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,840
I know it's impossible

115
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,600
to just ask for one,

116
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,800
but I need one story

117
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,280
whether it was from the officer's training

118
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,240
or from one of your deployments.

119
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
Something that taught you,

120
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,640
something that you're taking with you

121
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,480
until now.

122
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,760
That's always the fun, the most fun.

123
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,280
Oh, that's a great question.

124
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,960
I think the lesson I learned

125
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,880
from officer training,

126
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,040
especially the infantry officer course,

127
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,680
the Marine Corps does a fantastic job

128
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,680
of training young leaders.

129
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,040
And the one thing they want you to learn

130
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,400
is to operate under uncertainty.

131
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,100
And so, the infantry officer course

132
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,280
kind of from start to finish,

133
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,440
is just one uncertain event

134
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,080
after another.

135
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,760
They'll wake you up at three a.m.

136
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,000
and send you off on missions

137
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,600
where they won't tell you what's coming

138
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,760
three hours later.

139
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,200
And I think the value I gained from that

140
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,000
over time was just being very comfortable

141
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,560
without knowing what's coming next.

142
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,080
And in every job I've had since,

143
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,000
it's just been very valuable to know

144
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,520
that through persistence,

145
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,400
I can just figure it out

146
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,680
and to be able to make decisions

147
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,160
under uncertainty.

148
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,640
And the Marine Corps just did

149
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,480
a fantastic job for training that.

150
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,080
Unbelievable.

151
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,720
I remember I climbed Kilimanjaro

152
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,040
with my father and brother

153
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,000
about a year ago exactly,

154
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,240
and on the climb I read,

155
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,560
"Extreme Leadership"

156
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,240
by two people that were very high

157
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,640
in the ranks in the US army,

158
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,840
and I remember just how impressed I was

159
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,640
with this mindset

160
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,240
and obviously having gone through

161
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,800
a military training of my own,

162
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,600
I don't think it was as intense,

163
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,080
probably a little much less intense

164
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,280
than what you've experienced.

165
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,820
I was much more in the typing.

166
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,900
My finger got injured.

167
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,200
That was the biggest injury I had.

168
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,120
But that's incredible. Okay.

169
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,240
So, you do that.

170
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,680
And where do you go from there?

171
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
How do you how do you get then

172
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,120
to do law in Yale

173
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,640
and then business at Stanford?

174
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Yeah. So around 2013, it was sort of

175
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,680
increasingly obvious to a lot of us

176
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,960
that the wars were winding down

177
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,800
and if the wars were winding down,

178
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,280
at least for me, it sort of, began to lose

179
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,160
a bit of its idealistic purpose. And so,

180
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,520
if the wars weren't gonna be there,

181
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,000
I decided it was time to move on.

182
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,480
And it didn't come from

183
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,000
a desire for combat,

184
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,320
but it came from this sense that

185
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,840
there was a lot of mission

186
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,120
and purpose when we were preparing for war

187
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,760
and if we weren't doing that,

188
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,720
it wasn't going to feel quite as visceral.

189
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,680
And little did I know that a year later

190
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,960
we'd be back at war with ISIS

191
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,000
but either way, I made my decision

192
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,240
and decided to leave.

193
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,120
And so I wanted to go to graduate school.

194
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,040
I knew that over the long term,

195
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,680
I wanted to do two things in my life:

196
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,400
I wanted to be able to engage

197
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,160
in the world of ideas and policy

198
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,920
and I also wanted to start companies.

199
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,440
And so I decided with four years

200
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,960
of the GI Bill,

201
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,920
that it would pay for school,

202
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,680
that I would try to do law and business

203
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,040
because law would give me that ability

204
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,280
to work in the world of ideas and policy

205
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,720
and business school would help train me

206
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,840
for a career in the private sector

207
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,960
and creating companies.

208
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,800
And honestly, I think

209
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,960
there's something about veterans

210
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,680
who come out of the military and feel that

211
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,480
the world outside the military

212
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,400
is so foreign.

213
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,720
You don't really know

214
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,480
what's happening out there,

215
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,840
so we decide to go to grad school

216
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,920
or to go to college.

217
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,360
And I've seen that through

218
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,920
a lot of my friends leaving the military.

219
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,080
That there's almost this desire

220
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,400
to like arm up with degrees

221
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,600
'cause it's going to prepare you for world afterwards.

222
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,760
And so I ended up doing that

223
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,360
and getting the two joint degrees.

224
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,800
I think that's so interesting.

225
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,920
In the Israeli military, every day you see

226
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,160
one of your friends getting released

227
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,920
because everybody is in the military

228
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,720
and there's always this initial shock

229
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,920
where you ask them on the day

230
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,640
that they're about to leave the base,

231
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,800
like how are you feeling?

232
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,320
Are you excited?

233
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,960
And almost all of them are saying,

234
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,560
"No, we're terrified.

235
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,880
We're excited that we're finished,

236
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
but we're terrified."

237
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,520
And then you meet them the next week

238
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,880
at a coffee shop in Tel Aviv,

239
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,680
and they're having

240
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,480
the time of their lives

241
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
already working on their second startup,

242
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,960
and the assimilation is quick

243
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,800
because I think

244
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,440
everybody goes through the experience

245
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,600
so they're able to talk to

246
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,520
a lot a lot of people

247
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,640
who've gone through this.

248
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,160
So you get your law

249
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,960
and your business degree,

250
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,880
you're also an associate at J-Ventures,

251
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,960
and I'd love to touch upon this book

252
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,140
that by the time this airs,

253
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,880
has already come out

254
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,120
because it's touching on something

255
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,760
that I became very passionate about,

256
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,920
studying with Larry Diamond

257
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,560
at Stanford this year,

258
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,280
talking about the polarization

259
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,480
within the United States.

260
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,520
How do you go then,

261
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,600
because you've done this in the past

262
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
just two years, right,

263
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,440
writing the book.

264
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,600
So, what drives you to go

265
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,120
and think critically about community

266
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,560
within the US and where we're at now?

267
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,760
Yeah and you know, so I started this while

268
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,240
I was at Stanford Business School

269
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,920
and it was also at the same time

270
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,600
I started working for J-Ventures

271
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,400
and I started working

272
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,240
for Eric Schmidt at Schmidt Features.

273
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,000
And I think to your point

274
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,200
before, leaving the military

275
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,920
I felt like I needed to go to school.

276
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,400
I needed to get some credentials

277
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,720
and arm up with more information,

278
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,920
but very quickly realized

279
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,760
that at that stage in my life,

280
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,560
that the best information I would get

281
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,320
would actually come from working

282
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,000
and in going out and experiencing things

283
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,080
and learning on the job.

284
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,200
And so, by the time I got to Stanford,

285
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,200
I focused mostly externally

286
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,000
and was trying to find opportunities

287
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,520
where I can learn the skills

288
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,680
I really wanted to learn.

289
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,840
And with J-Ventures

290
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,880
I got to learn about what it looks like

291
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,520
to do due diligence on companies

292
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,040
and how to think about the markets

293
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,920
they were moving into

294
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,400
and how to look at a team

295
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,800
and evaluate whether you want to make

296
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,600
a bet on this group.

297
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,560
With Eric Schmidt,

298
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,120
I learned some incredible lessons about

299
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,360
how to think about things at scale

300
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,120
or how to take ideas from good to great

301
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,840
or collaborate

302
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,960
with different groups of people.

303
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,000
And separately, this was around 2016,

304
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,320
and clearly something was happening

305
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,840
in the country.

306
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,400
There was a lot of division

307
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,640
and the country seemed to be convulsing

308
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,120
under this weird political environment,

309
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,440
and I decided

310
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,720
I wanted to see it firsthand.

311
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,480
So instead of learning about it

312
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,720
through the news or in classrooms,

313
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,080
I wanted to see it on the ground.

314
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,720
So you go and you get into a car

315
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,960
and you just drive.

316
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,480
Yeah, and the first few trips

317
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,560
started just for fun.

318
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,840
My friend and I wanted to be on the road.

319
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,280
And so, we took some of our breaks and

320
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,000
and picked a few places

321
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
we wanted to visit

322
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,640
and just got out on the road.

323
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,240
And while we're out there,

324
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,520
you just see the country differently.

325
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,320
It's big and beautiful

326
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,600
and everyone you meet is hospitable.

327
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,840
And you learn something from them.

328
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,560
And we also learned from each other.

329
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,880
And being in a car for long hours,

330
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,320
my friend Chris is a hippie from Berkeley,

331
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,840
I'm a conservative Marine,

332
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,640
and we had such different world views,

333
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,960
but over long conversations,

334
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,720
we were able to untangle

335
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
all these common values

336
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,800
that we actually had

337
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,040
underneath it all

338
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,680
even if if we were just having a debate

339
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,440
with friends,

340
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,840
we would seem to be at odds on everything.

341
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,560
When we were really able to give it time

342
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,440
and with humility,

343
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,800
we found that we shared

344
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,040
all these common values

345
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,920
and where we didn't,

346
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,040
we learned something about ourselves.

347
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,520
We learned what blind spots we had

348
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,920
or what presuppositions

349
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,280
we were coming to arguments with.

350
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,720
And so the heart of our story

351
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,200
ended up being the things we learned

352
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,520
about each other and our friendship,

353
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,280
and the things we learned

354
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,920
about the country

355
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,360
through the people we met.

356
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,800
And so the book is this argument

357
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
for what still binds us together,

358
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
despite all the political division today.

359
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,600
I think that is so wonderful

360
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,320
and it's so optimistic.

361
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,360
One of the incredible things

362
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,600
that I was so inspired by

363
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,680
learning this year with Larry Diamond

364
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,600
was this experiment in

365
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,920
one ... room he had

366
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,720
where he brought in hundreds of people

367
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,680
from a random group to Texas, to a hotel, and

368
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,025
into a venue,

369
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:23,960
and over three days

370
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,320
they had them converse

371
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,640
in a very humane way.

372
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,440
And all of a sudden,

373
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,120
what inspired me most was,

374
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,080
not that they changed

375
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,400
beliefs sometimes, but that

376
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,200
Democrats began seeing Republicans

377
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,560
as instead of enemies,

378
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,400
as people that they can converse with

379
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,200
and have some common ground with

380
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,920
and same vice versa.

381
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,960
And that, I mean that was

382
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,360
the hopeful message here

383
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,080
and that's why

384
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,440
I'm really really looking forward

385
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,400
to reading the book.

386
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,600
But Jordan, I want to talk

387
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
about Schmidt Futures

388
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,040
because one of the things

389
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,400
that I saw is that

390
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,360
you're very into impact investing.

391
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:56,640
Right?

392
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,320
And Eric also, all the way

393
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,520
back from Innovation Endeavors,

394
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,080
is all about investing

395
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,200
and looking at things

396
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,920
that are moving the needle.

397
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,640
What is impact for you

398
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,800
and why are you following that route?

399
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,040
Yeah, it's a great question.

400
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,040
So, for me, there are things I care about.

401
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,880
I care about the future of America

402
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,240
and I want to see it healthy.

403
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,920
That's a lot of where the book came from.

404
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,080
And I care a lot

405
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,040
about the future of security and creating a

406
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,240
more vibrant, prosperous world,

407
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,800
free of war,

408
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,920
and I think some of that that drove my desire

409
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,280
to go into the military.

410
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,000
And ultimately, I think

411
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,200
the ability for a free democratic society

412
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,320
to survive depends on progress.

413
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,440
We need to keep growing the pie.

414
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,960
If people feel like the pie is shrinking,

415
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,920
if people feel like we're static,

416
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,840
then it becomes very zero-sum

417
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,800
and it's very hard

418
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,560
for our democratic systems

419
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,440
to survive in that kind of world.

420
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,320
And so, there is this imperative

421
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,800
for us to drive progress,

422
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,880
and that's progress in the fields

423
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,040
of science, in technology.

424
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,520
It's progress in our understanding

425
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,720
of human rights and civil rights.

426
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,840
And that's what we do

427
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,520
at Schmidt Futures.

428
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,800
We look to advance scientific frontiers.

429
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,800
We try to advance technology's impact

430
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,720
on society,

431
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,480
and we try to advance shared prosperity

432
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,120
and national security.

433
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,040
And we've taken a sort of unique approach

434
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,600
and we're very lucky to have

435
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,360
Eric Schmidt as our founder

436
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,800
who believes deeply in this

437
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,880
and he pushes us

438
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,800
not to think necessarily about returns,

439
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,680
but to think about

440
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,840
the talent we're backing

441
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,520
and how we're transferring risk

442
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,600
from them to us.

443
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,520
And so his theory, and our theory, is that

444
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,960
the way to achieve progress

445
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,080
is to go find exceptional people

446
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,920
who don't have a track record yet.

447
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
And because they don't have

448
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,440
a track record,

449
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:45,960
others aren't really willing

450
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,480
to invest in them.

451
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,920
So venture capital firms

452
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,160
won't invest on the riskiest ideas

453
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,480
because they're not proven out

454
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,520
in the market yet.

455
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,960
Government won't invest in very high risk

456
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,320
research and development

457
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,520
because they're using taxpayer dollars.

458
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,200
And so these ideas are people

459
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,560
that don't yet have track records,

460
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,800
have a hard time getting the capital

461
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,000
to test their ideas.

462
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,440
And so what we do, is we try to look

463
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,480
for those exceptional people,

464
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,240
people who but for our investment,

465
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,120
they wouldn't be able to do

466
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,720
or try the thing they want to try.

467
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,120
And then we make bets on them,

468
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,320
and we give them risk capital.

469
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,200
We don't take any equity from it.

470
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,800
It is purely for the impact

471
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,880
they can create.

472
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,320
And then we try to support them

473
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,720
through helping build teams around them,

474
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,680
giving them support and mentorship,

475
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,120
and watching as, through teams and talent

476
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,000
and support, they achieve

477
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,960
their breakthroughs.

478
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,560
And, if it doesn't work, it's okay.

479
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,800
We'll support them again

480
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,880
on their next try.

481
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,840
And in doing so,

482
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,960
by transferring that risk off them to us,

483
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,240
we think will lead to a lot

484
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,760
more breakthroughs in the world.

485
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,120
Wow. Okay. So I mean,

486
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,080
the idea of a venture capital

487
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,880
is that you invest in, let's say,

488
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,760
10 companies a year.

489
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,960
Hopefully one of them will return 10X

490
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,200
and then you're balancing out

491
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,520
and you're able to continue doing that.

492
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,880
When you're giving risk capital

493
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,320
for no equity you're essentially,

494
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,360
I mean, you're just diluting

495
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,960
the same pie that you had initially

496
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,560
without putting in more.

497
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,480
So, it sounds like

498
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,160
you have to even be more risk averse

499
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,840
as you're going through your journey

500
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,920
than in traditional venture capital.

501
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,240
And you're betting on people.

502
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,840
You're betting on talent.

503
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,120
How do you go about doing that?

504
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,880
I mean, and what does that mean

505
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,800
to be head of talent

506
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,520
within Schmidt Futures?

507
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
Yeah, it's a great question.

508
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,360
So as head of talent, I oversee

509
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,920
all of our internal talent development.

510
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,440
So, because we want to bet on talent,

511
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
we also think internally

512
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,760
we have to have the best team.

513
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,200
I'm responsible for recruiting everyone we have.

514
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
And then we have a number

515
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,240
of talent programs.

516
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,280
So we have an entrepreneur

517
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,480
in residence program.

518
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,880
We have a Science Fellows program.

519
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,240
An APM program.

520
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,280
All of these are designed

521
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,920
to go find exceptional people

522
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,400
and channel them into certain areas

523
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,480
that we think are underrepresented

524
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,560
with that kind of talent.

525
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,000
So, for instance,

526
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,240
our Science Fellows program

527
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,680
is trying to produce more

528
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,960
interdisciplinary scientists.

529
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,320
We don't think there's enough of those

530
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,800
even though all the breakthroughs

531
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,200
we're gonna see in the next few decades

532
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,440
are gonna come

533
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,600
at the intersection of fields.

534
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,840
It's when we combine things like

535
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,280
computer science and biology

536
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,400
that you get these

537
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,560
interesting breakthroughs.

538
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,120
And so our program

539
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,520
is designed to do that.

540
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,360
Similarly, we don't think

541
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,280
there's enough computer scientists

542
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,440
in the philanthropic world.

543
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,560
And so our APM program is designed

544
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,920
to take computer scientists

545
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,800
and then put them

546
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,280
on moonshot type ventures

547
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,920
in the philanthropy world.

548
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,760
And so, I oversee

549
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,000
all those talent programs.

550
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,600
And I think the reality is,

551
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,480
no one has really cracked the code

552
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,040
on how you can rigorously

553
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,360
test for talent.

554
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,520
There's still somewhat of an art to this.

555
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,080
And everyone on our team

556
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,800
has developed their own methods

557
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,920
for how you find that.

558
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,880
And for some people,

559
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,680
it's they have almost

560
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,880
like archetypes in their head.

561
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,400
Just like in Hollywood,

562
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,360
there's specific roles in movies

563
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,360
that you look for.

564
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,720
We think in the talent world,

565
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,960
there are specific archetypes

566
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,880
that if you find them,

567
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,760
they're really worth betting on.

568
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,200
And so, there's the genius generative type

569
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,880
who they just see targets differently

570
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,800
and as a result, they're constantly

571
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,200
coming up with new ideas.

572
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,560
But that person might be terrible

573
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,640
at managing a team.

574
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,600
And so, if we can find that genius

575
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,680
and then pair them with

576
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,720
a highly talented operator,

577
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,640
someone who just, kind of like

578
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,960
the chief of staff type function

579
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,840
in the military,

580
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,400
they just know how to execute.

581
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,040
Then that's like a dynamo combination.

582
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,160
And so, a lot of what our team does

583
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,280
is try to find

584
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,600
those different archetypes

585
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,360
or try to find ways of testing for genius

586
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,680
or generative ability,

587
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,000
and then finding the right pair

588
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,040
so that you maximize

589
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,320
their potential impact.

590
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,880
Wow. Okay. That's just, I mean

591
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,080
to me it sounds like a dream job.

592
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,760
I mean sitting there and trying to think

593
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,800
how can we be bet on moonshot ideas

594
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,240
by moonshot people

595
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,080
that have a chance to succeed in this

596
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,360
and we want to join their journey

597
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,160
and support them,

598
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,600
and doing that without taking equity

599
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,720
and without thinking about

600
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,800
the capital side of things,

601
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,000
but embracing the talent that they have

602
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,680
and at the end, making a positive impact

603
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,100
on democracy and the country.

604
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,300
I think that's just incredible.

605
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,720
Jordan, what excites you most?

606
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,600
I mean, you're seeing

607
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,320
so many different talents,

608
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:23,800
and you're seeing

609
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,640
so many different projects,

610
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,320
you're constantly embracing

611
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,880
this idea of moonshot and impact investing.

612
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,480
What do you get most excited about?

613
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,640
Yeah. So, I get really excited

614
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,120
when I find someone

615
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,360
who has this incredible combination

616
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,840
of just raw talent,

617
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,200
they're very talented,

618
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,720
they care deeply about an issue,

619
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,160
and they have the specific skill set

620
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,280
and unique insight to go solve it.

621
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,480
And the reason I get so excited about that

622
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,760
is it's actually really rare.

623
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,680
It's very very rare to find someone

624
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,040
who just they care so much about an issue

625
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,000
and they've really figured out

626
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,080
a specific insight

627
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,560
into how you could solve it

628
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,160
and they happen

629
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,720
to have the right skill set

630
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,800
in order to do it.

631
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,160
And when you find that person,

632
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,760
it's like unlocking a code

633
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,920
that just can change the game.

634
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,360
And we found a few those

635
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,320
at Schmidt Futures,

636
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,560
and it's like the greatest joy

637
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,400
to find that person

638
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,560
and then get to help them do

639
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,960
whatever it is they're gonna do

640
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,680
because the amount of change

641
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,400
and impact they have

642
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,840
is so fast and so quick

643
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,360
once they get the support they need.

644
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,400
And so, yeah.

645
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,320
I get really excited about that.

646
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,800
There's one person in particular

647
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,000
who I always love to talk about.

648
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,640
Her name's Clem Jacoby,

649
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,960
who was a Google PM

650
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,000
and became obsessed

651
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,760
with the criminal justice system

652
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,480
because her uncle had gone to prison

653
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,360
multiple times.

654
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,000
And she had this insight

655
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,960
into how you can change

656
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,040
the criminal justice system

657
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,360
and she's gonna do it.

658
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,760
And with a very small check from us,

659
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,160
she's now raised over $10 million.

660
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,040
She's operating in all 50 states.

661
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,440
And she will change

662
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,200
the criminal justice system in the US.

663
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,000
And that all happened in one year.

664
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,520
Like in one year, she did that.

665
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,240
So, that's what I get excited about.

666
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
Wow. And how long is usually this process

667
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,680
as you're meeting new people

668
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,400
and as you were hearing

669
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,240
about their talents,

670
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,280
and you're actually forming

671
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,720
a much more meaningful relationship

672
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,480
about that person

673
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,800
not just about the how good is the market

674
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,320
and what are the likely returns.

675
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,920
You're putting that effort

676
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,880
that a VC might put

677
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,600
and you're navigating it

678
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,760
towards that person

679
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,440
and their motivation and their abilities.

680
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,040
So how long does that usually take you?

681
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,760
It varies by person

682
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,920
and it varies on the kind of person

683
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,440
we're betting on.

684
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,280
But someone like Clem,

685
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,560
it was almost immediate that we realized

686
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,360
like this person's special.

687
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,120
Let's see what she can do.

688
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,120
And so, often we'll start

689
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,040
with a smaller check

690
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,920
just to test them to see

691
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,480
with a little bit of money

692
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,280
what could they do.

693
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,600
And if they're able to get some traction

694
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,960
and show us that

695
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,160
they really have the ability to do

696
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,760
whatever it is they say they want to do,

697
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,880
then we'll go bigger on them.

698
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,480
And so, that first check could be within

699
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,680
a couple of weeks of meeting the person.

700
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,960
Wow. Jordan, it sounds like a dream job.

701
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,000
Definitely wait for my resume one day,

702
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
that I want to come and ... thank you

703
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,800
and learn as much as I can.

704
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,080
But before we leave, and I can't believe

705
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,840
20 minutes are almost up

706
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,240
I have so many more questions to ask you.

707
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,360
This is so bad.

708
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,040
I need three words from you,

709
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,240
and then I have one more question

710
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,280
that I'm gonna have to squeeze in there.

711
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,360
I need three words that you would use

712
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,880
to describe yourself.

713
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,680
Three words to describe myself.

714
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,480
Yes. It's the hardest question

715
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,760
out of all of them.

716
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,440
That is very hard. Okay.

717
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,600
I'll go with persistent.

718
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,680
Freckly.

719
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,400
I have a lot of freckles

720
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,240
you might not be able to see them.

721
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,120
And patriotic.

722
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,160
I love it. I love it.

723
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,800
I love it. I love it.

724
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,920
Okay. The last question

725
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,840
and this is actually going to be

726
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,480
my favorite one.

727
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,960
Leadership.

728
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,040
You've seen leadership across academia,

729
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,080
across military, across venture capital.

730
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,920
What's a common theme?

731
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,760
What is something that you see

732
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,040
that keeps coming up

733
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,520
no matter where you are in the world,

734
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,320
no matter what you do.

735
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,720
Because I'm guided by this idea that

736
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,880
leadership isn't

737
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,800
when you're in the boardroom.

738
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,840
It's not when you're in front

739
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,320
of your companies.

740
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,800
It's everywhere you walk,

741
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,360
every move you do,

742
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,600
you need to act as a leader

743
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,680
and you need to think of yourself

744
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,400
as a leader.

745
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,640
But so, what are common themes

746
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,840
that you're seeing?

747
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,800
Yeah to me,

748
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,960
the most important leadership quality

749
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,000
and the most consistent one

750
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,040
I've seen in great leaders,

751
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,240
is they just genuinely care

752
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,840
about the people under their command

753
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,840
or under their charge.

754
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,160
They just they truly love them

755
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,480
and they'll do anything for them.

756
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,120
And leaders who have that quality,

757
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,240
they end up putting more time and effort

758
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,160
into the things they do

759
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,600
because it comes from that place of care.

760
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,160
And people feel it.

761
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,840
You can feel when someone genuinely cares

762
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,000
about your well-being and your future

763
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,560
and the best leaders do that.

764
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,240
And they do it just because

765
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,560
that's who they are.

766
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,420
I love it.

767
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,320
Jordan, thank you very very much.

768
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,840
This was inspiring and I look forward

769
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,920
to continue learning from you

770
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,280
and reading your book

771
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,400
and maintaining this relationship.

772
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,520
This was wonderful.

773
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,920
This was, and it was my pleasure.

774
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,360
Thanks so much for having me.

775
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,000
Thank you. Take care. Bye bye.

776
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,900
All right. Bye.
