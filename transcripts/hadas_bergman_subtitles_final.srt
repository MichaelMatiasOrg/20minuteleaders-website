1
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,640
Hadas Bergman, thank you so much

2
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,280
for being on my show.

3
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,360
How are you?

4
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:46,920
I'm good.

5
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,680
Thank you for having me, Michael.

6
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,000
So, you're calling from Tel Aviv

7
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,840
but you're actually based in Boston now.

8
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
You said you left your husband

9
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,320
in Cambridge.

10
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,720
I did.

11
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,360
So I just finished my first year

12
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,440
at Harvard Business School,

13
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,160
and we both live

14
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,840
in Harvard Square in Cambridge.

15
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,240
And I really wanted to see my family.

16
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,640
Finished my summer internship.

17
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,960
Packed my bags.

18
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,200
And came to Israel for a month.

19
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,320
I'm actually in 14 days

20
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,040
state mandated quarantine.

21
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,120
So, I've actually not left this house

22
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,320
in 13 days.

23
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,880
Tomorrow I'm going free.

24
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,320
You literally haven't even left

25
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,240
to go downstairs just to breath fresh air?

26
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,160
No.

27
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,320
And you're still sane?

28
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
I'm trying to be.

29
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,200
...

30
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,560
I love it. Okay. Hadas, I'm really excited

31
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,320
to hear about your journey,

32
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,520
and I'm particularly excited to focus on

33
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,840
the different transitions you've made

34
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,000
that are not very common for people

35
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,920
that come out

36
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,160
of the path that we did.

37
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,840
So both of us served in the 8200 unit,

38
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,160
but you actually took

39
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,120
an interesting path from there.

40
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,360
I know you worked at Matrix

41
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,280
on data and then product,

42
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,160
but then you transitioned into consulting

43
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,680
which is something irregular

44
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,760
for a lot of the techies

45
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,520
that come out of 8200.

46
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,680
And now, obviously,

47
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,240
you're in Harvard Business School

48
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,600
which I think is a story

49
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
worth telling on its own

50
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,040
the application process

51
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,000
and how the first year was.

52
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,280
So Hadas, take me back

53
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,120
to your days in 8200.

54
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,360
You're finishing the unit,

55
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,320
and you're transitioning

56
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,040
into sort of the real world.

57
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,200
Why consulting?

58
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,760
Why do you go that path?

59
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,480
So that's an excellent question.

60
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,520
So, I felt like I started

61
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,400
going down the path

62
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,160
that a lot of people

63
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,320
who served with us did

64
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,680
which was doing 8200

65
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,520
and then doing university.

66
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,600
And I worked for a startup

67
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,920
for almost three years.

68
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,800
I was one of the first employees.

69
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,360
Russell Rothstein, yeah.

70
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Yes. And I really liked

71
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,640
the kind of entrepreneurship

72
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,240
startup ecosystem in Israel,

73
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,400
but I realized that if I planned

74
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,160
to be in this community in the future,

75
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,040
it would actually be more powerful for me

76
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,040
to understand how big businesses

77
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,440
and big corporates and governments work.

78
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,640
So, I really felt like

79
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,080
I needed to complete my tool kit

80
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,760
with more strategic thinking

81
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,960
and strategic operations

82
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,520
of large organization.

83
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,880
So I went to, I started basically

84
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,160
recruiting for consulting.

85
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,480
Nobody knew what it was.

86
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,280
In the US, I feel like everybody knows

87
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,200
what consulting is.

88
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,280
Right. Exactly. It's like a go to path

89
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,360
for so many in the US.

90
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,360
But in Israel, you don't even

91
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,920
speak about it.

92
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,960
When you're friend

93
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,200
graduates from the unit,

94
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,000
you never ask them,

95
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,640
"Hey, are you gonna think

96
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,720
about going into consulting?"

97
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,160
Right?

98
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,280
It's not even an option.

99
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,600
Yeah.

100
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,600
It was definitely a path less traveled

101
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,840
for kind of the people we hang out with usually.

102
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,920
But I actually sort of fell in love with it.

103
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,560
I spent about four years at TASC,

104
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,280
which is basically a Tel Aviv based

105
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,560
strategic consulting firm

106
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,480
which works with

107
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,640
the largest organization in Israel.

108
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,400
Banks, telecom companies,

109
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,000
a lot of work with government.

110
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,400
And as I started working in consulting,

111
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,640
I started understanding

112
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,920
how interesting it is

113
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,720
to realize what challenges

114
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,000
large corporates are having

115
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,720
and actually see from their perspective

116
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,360
the disruption that is happening

117
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,040
to their industries by startups.

118
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,800
So by working with a bank

119
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,880
or working with other type of

120
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,480
like big institutes and seeing

121
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,800
what's coming up their way

122
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,280
and the way they cope with it

123
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,640
and the way they treat it

124
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,920
was very interesting.

125
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,760
And also seeing

126
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,440
how they incorporate technology

127
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,640
into what they're doing.

128
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,840
So, give me your two cents

129
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,360
about your time spent at TASC.

130
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,880
What was consulting for you?

131
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,480
And what value did you bring

132
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,800
these big corporates?

133
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,120
Whether it was helping them

134
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,200
integrate with technology

135
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,920
or helping them understand

136
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,440
global issues better.

137
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,560
What was the real added value there?

138
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,040
So, the company I worked for

139
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,280
did not have a digital practice,

140
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,040
so a practice that helped businesses

141
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,000
with their digital transformation journey

142
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,600
and with incorporating technology.

143
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,640
So basically,

144
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,280
I helped the company establish a practice

145
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,120
that was for digital transformation

146
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,880
and hire people that are doing product,

147
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,960
that are doing data,

148
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,760
that are doing user interfaces

149
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,000
which did not exist

150
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,480
in a traditional consulting firm.

151
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,760
And I think one of the things

152
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,960
I'm really proud of is that

153
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,600
I worked a lot

154
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,000
with the Israeli government

155
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,960
and specifically

156
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,560
the Digital Israel Bureau

157
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,440
which is in charge

158
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,760
of digital transformation

159
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,400
of Israel as a whole.

160
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,880
And I helped them work

161
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,640
on the national digital strategy

162
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,360
for Israel, which was approved

163
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,800
by government resolution

164
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,720
at one billion ... shekels.

165
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,640
And then doing projects

166
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,680
for the Ministry of Agriculture,

167
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,240
Ministry of Environmental Protection,

168
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,320
Ministry of Justice,

169
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,880
about how do they take

170
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,080
what they currently do

171
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,040
and how do they do it

172
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,200
in the digital world.

173
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,680
And it was a great journey to do

174
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,880
with really great people

175
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,680
who care about the citizens.

176
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,560
That's amazing.

177
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,040
And how long did you spend at TASC?

178
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,480
About four years.

179
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,160
So Hadas, now you're at a junction,

180
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,120
because you've done

181
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,320
your 8200 intelligence unit route.

182
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,920
You've done the data and product route

183
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,840
at IT Central and Matrix, etc.

184
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,520
And then you've done

185
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,120
your four years at consulting.

186
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,160
And now you have to decide

187
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,000
what do I do next.

188
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,320
And what you do is you go online

189
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,160
and you write 10 essays

190
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,640
to apply for Harvard Business School

191
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,360
and many more tests that are even harder

192
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,800
than the essays.

193
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,320
Why?

194
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,960
Why go to business school

195
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,160
after all those years?

196
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,800
You've had a lot of experience,

197
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
and you're much older than I think

198
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,760
than the average person, I guess,

199
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,200
who would apply.

200
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,760
Maybe I'm wrong.

201
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,160
But you've had so much experience already

202
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,840
in the workforce.

203
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,720
And you're deciding, yes,

204
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,880
to go back to school, put those on hold,

205
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,560
and to go and enrich yourself again.

206
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,320
Why do you do that?

207
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,560
So, just as you said, to enrich myself.

208
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,760
I felt that the experience I had

209
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,040
was very Israeli focused.

210
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,760
The consulting company I worked for

211
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,600
only dealt with, or almost

212
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,720
only dealt with, Israeli companies.

213
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,200
And I felt I was missing

214
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,880
the global perspective in it.

215
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,120
In the end, we live in a global world,

216
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,960
and I felt like

217
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,440
I didn't have that experience.

218
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,360
I didn't know enough people from the US

219
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,120
or from all the different countries.

220
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,840
I did not know how corporates

221
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,200
or how ecosystems look

222
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,520
in different markets.

223
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,360
And another reason I wanted to do that

224
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,720
is because an area

225
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,000
that I'm really passionate about

226
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,840
is the area of digital health

227
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,040
or health care tech,

228
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,240
which I think has a lot of potential

229
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,480
of improving the health care

230
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,160
of, well basically all of us,

231
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,120
you and me included.

232
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
So, I thought that business school

233
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
would be a good place to also learn

234
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,080
and kind of get into a new ...

235
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,320
and make this transition.

236
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,600
So it all fit in,

237
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,160
but it was definitely challenging.

238
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,000
It has high opportunity costs

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,320
of the time you lose

240
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,960
by doing two years of business school.

241
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,320
Financial cost.

242
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,120
I had to,

243
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,640
me and my husband got married,

244
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,080
went on our honeymoon in Tanzania,

245
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,200
and moved to a new country.

246
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,480
He's never been to the US.

247
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,120
It's been challenging.

248
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,400
But what is life without challenge.

249
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,280
I love that.

250
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,600
Okay. But I want to go back because so many people,

251
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,160
I mean everybody knows

252
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,280
about Harvard Business School

253
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,840
and so many people talk about it.

254
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,720
Very few people are actually there

255
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,560
and few people also apply to get there.

256
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,200
And I'd love for you

257
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,520
to give me a little bit of an overview

258
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,400
about this application process,

259
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,080
especially for our friends in Israel

260
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,560
who don't necessarily really know

261
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,400
what it's like to apply

262
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,480
to a university in the US.

263
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,280
I know that when I came to Stanford,

264
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,440
I got bombarded with questions.

265
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,800
Wow. You applied to a university in the US.

266
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,960
You went through the whole process.

267
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
You actually got in.

268
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,040
It feels like it's like this long shot

269
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,320
that because we're so far away,

270
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,760
when I don't really think that it is.

271
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,480
But I want to hear from you.

272
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,520
What is tangibly the experience

273
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,520
and what things can our friends

274
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,320
back in Israel can think about

275
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,880
as they're considering this path?

276
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,560
So, first of all, you need to be

277
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,840
in a different mindset.

278
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,440
In Israel, you're used to that,

279
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,400
basically, you sending your scores

280
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,320
and you get in, right?

281
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,920
When you apply to business school,

282
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,280
they care about who you are as a person.

283
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,960
They want to hear your personal story

284
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,320
and your personal path.

285
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,160
They want to hear about

286
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,240
your success story.

287
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,040
They want to hear about

288
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,280
very different things.

289
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,520
So, the journey to get

290
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,160
into business school

291
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,880
requires obviously the standardized test

292
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,840
where you have to do,

293
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,400
most people do the GMAT test

294
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,800
and the TOEFL, which you need to get

295
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,760
really high scores at.

296
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,800
So that's the minimum.

297
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,040
And then you need to do

298
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,480
a lot of different essays.

299
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,040
You need to re-do your entire resume

300
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,640
because Israeli resume basically

301
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,520
is a grocery list

302
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,800
of your responsibilities

303
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,280
whereas applying to places in the US,

304
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,640
and especially business school,

305
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,320
is about your achievements

306
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,800
and what makes you better

307
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,880
than your peers.

308
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,920
So, going into that mindset

309
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,200
of not being humble

310
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,160
but not being too braggy,

311
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,680
is something that is really hard

312
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,720
to transition.

313
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,280
And then finding a way

314
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,720
to tell your personal story

315
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,360
in a way that would be interesting

316
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,440
for somebody who reads it,

317
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,800
that would make somebody exciting

318
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,120
about having you there,

319
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,880
is not something

320
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,680
that I think, as Israelis, we're used to.

321
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,880
We don't write cover letters.

322
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,320
We don't write essays to get into places.

323
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,880
I personally also worked

324
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,040
with a consulting firm

325
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,800
that just helps people with applications.

326
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,720
I don't mind saying it.

327
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,800
I work for consulting,

328
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,760
so I valued having somebody on my side

329
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,520
who can read what I'm writing and be like,

330
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,000
"This is not bold enough.

331
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You can do better."

332
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,080
100%.

333
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,840
Well, two things come to mind

334
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,160
when you say it.

335
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,400
First of all,

336
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,240
what you said in the beginning,

337
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,320
and I think it's important

338
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,640
not to overlook it,

339
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,760
this idea that the SAT and GMAT

340
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,680
and your grades are the minimum.

341
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,720
They're like the foundation

342
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,200
on which these universities are looking

343
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,360
at your application and saying,

344
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,760
"Is this a candidate that will be able

345
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:12,200
to finish the material in the curriculum?"

346
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,760
So, if they got a good SAT and

347
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,480
they got a good GMAT

348
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,400
and they got good grades

349
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,920
in their undergraduate or high school,

350
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,560
then it's likely a good indication

351
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,520
that they're hardworking

352
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,240
and that they'll be able

353
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,160
to simply sit in the class and work.

354
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,400
But then what you're mentioning is that

355
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,520
they're looking for this extra material

356
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,640
about your personality and who you are,

357
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,760
what is your edge,

358
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,280
that will actually help you

359
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,640
make a positive impact on the community.

360
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,280
And I know that when I sat down

361
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,400
for coffee with my admission supervisor,

362
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,280
who at the end decided

363
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,480
on my journey to Stanford,

364
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,120
he mentioned that

365
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,800
one of the most important things for them

366
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,200
is this idea of community.

367
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,640
How can we rest assured

368
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,880
that every person who comes in

369
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,320
will have a positive impact

370
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,400
on the community?

371
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,760
Because they said it's very easy

372
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,560
to get to fill the whole class

373
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,360
with valedictorians,

374
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,560
but that's not the goal.

375
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,800
And I think that

376
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,440
I want to hear a little bit about

377
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,120
the specifically the HBS experience.

378
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,680
What was it like

379
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,360
to be there this first year?

380
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,080
So, just saying, you are absolutely right.

381
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,480
They care about the cohort so much

382
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,920
to make sure it's diversified.

383
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,240
That you have interesting people.

384
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,760
That you have people that are passionate

385
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,520
about what they do.

386
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
So, definitely right.

387
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,920
About my first year,

388
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm gonna focus on the pre-covid part

389
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,800
if you don't mind.

390
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,920
Of course.

391
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,760
The experience was great.

392
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,200
It was so different than

393
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,080
what university is like in Israel,

394
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,240
because 100% of what we studied

395
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,680
was the case method.

396
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,600
So if somebody doesn't know.

397
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,760
The case method, basically,

398
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,680
instead of theoretically learning

399
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,880
something new, you get a case study

400
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,520
about a protagonist or a company

401
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,600
that is going through

402
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,480
a specific process

403
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,840
that can relate to launching a new product

404
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,520
or changing their ... method

405
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,160
or doing something specific.

406
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,200
And then you learn the concept,

407
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,240
the business concept you need

408
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,880
to learn, through the case.

409
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,880
So the entire learning method

410
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,000
was different.

411
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,760
We have 940 people in my cohort,

412
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,040
in my year.

413
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,480
They put us in 10 sections.

414
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,600
So, my section had 94 people.

415
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,280
And they try to make the composite

416
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,200
of each section

417
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,400
the same as the large ones.

418
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,880
So 42% women,

419
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,120
the same percentage of minorities,

420
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,960
same percentage of internationals

421
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,760
in each class.

422
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,640
So you're literally in a microcosm

423
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,440
of the bigger Harvard Business School,

424
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:18,880
but you're getting

425
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,240
a tiny Harvard Business School

426
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,040
which is a reflection

427
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,800
on the greater Harvard Business School.

428
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,680
Exactly.

429
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,240
So cool.

430
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,800
Yeah. And then you study

431
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,160
with the same 94 people.

432
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,480
They assign you with your seat.

433
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,560
Basically your best friends

434
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,360
are gonna be the people

435
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,840
sitting next to you, probably.

436
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,560
Assigned seats in business school.

437
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:35,960
Yes.

438
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,800
And then for the first year,

439
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,640
they change your seat

440
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,920
after second semester,

441
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,880
but basically you sit in the same place.

442
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,440
You have your classroom.

443
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,920
Everybody hangs the flags

444
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,080
of their nationalities in the back.

445
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,160
And basically, you just sit

446
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
in the same place

447
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,240
and you have the teachers,

448
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,880
who are amazing professors,

449
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,560
just rotate through the classroom

450
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,920
and you stay in your seat.

451
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,120
It was so different

452
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,480
than my undergrad experience.

453
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,040
I went to Hebrew University.

454
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,080
It was just mind blowing the first week.

455
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,800
Give me like one of the most

456
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,680
remarkable case studies that you've had

457
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,440
because I think that, I took a few of the

458
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,800
Stanford Business School classes.

459
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,720
And when I got introduced

460
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,320
to this notion of case studies

461
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,560
where you go home at night,

462
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,680
you read these 20, 30 pages

463
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,280
of a company's journey,

464
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,480
and then you try to invoke from that

465
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,800
some lessons about,

466
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,520
whether it's leadership or commerce

467
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,960
or supply chains or whatever.

468
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,880
But give me a specific example

469
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,600
of a case study so that people

470
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,480
who don't know what it is

471
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
can relate to it.

472
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,080
I think one of my first

473
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,280
my favorite case study

474
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,640
was actually Netflix

475
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,400
which is a company everybody knows,

476
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,200
but we had a case study

477
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,480
about them in strategy

478
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,320
which was about their transition

479
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,960
from being a online subscription

480
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,600
to getting DVD by mail,

481
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,000
to basically being

482
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,440
a content online streaming.

483
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,600
And what I really liked is

484
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,200
that they basically

485
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,240
We had interviews with the Netflix CEO

486
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,640
to hear from him as the case protagonist

487
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,760
about why did he make this decision.

488
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
How did he decide

489
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,680
that he's gonna bet the company

490
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,200
on this new thing where nobody,

491
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,000
not everyone even had Internet

492
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,760
when he decided to do that.

493
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,920
So, those are the type of experiences

494
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,640
where you have the case protagonists

495
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,760
coming to the classroom

496
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,200
or talking via video

497
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,280
and kind of really being engaged in that

498
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,720
I think you remember so much more

499
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,600
from the experience

500
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,720
and you're much more engaged

501
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,320
than if you just theoretically learn

502
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,400
about disruption

503
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,760
in traditional organizations as a theme.

504
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,280
What is the social aspect

505
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,480
of the Harvard Business School like?

506
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,000
Is it very competitive?

507
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,120
Because everybody there is a rock star.

508
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,720
So, how is the social scene

509
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,960
after hours in the classroom?

510
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,800
So, it's very interesting

511
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,040
because it's not competitive at all.

512
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,880
Grades, we always say grades don't matter.

513
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,640
So you only get, in each class,

514
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,200
one, two or three.

515
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,640
You don't actually have a GPA

516
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,000
or any type of score.

517
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
In the end, you're either

518
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,240
a valedictorian or not.

519
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,800
That's it.

520
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,680
There is nothing else.

521
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,760
So, it's not that competitive.

522
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,600
And the social aspect is really fun.

523
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,720
So your section is kind of your family.

524
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,040
You have section retreats,

525
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,480
and section activities,

526
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,160
and birthday parties and baby showers

527
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,680
and happy hours and beer olympics.

528
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,560
Americans take their drinking

529
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,720
very very seriously.

530
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,240
I need two sentences about beer olympics,

531
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,640
because I haven't even heard of that.

532
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,160
So beer olympics is basically

533
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,320
a competition where you have two teams

534
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,040
that face each other.

535
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,960
They usually rotate

536
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,240
through different stations.

537
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,880
And they, for example, play beer pong.

538
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,600
They play there's a version

539
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,720
that's called soccer.

540
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,320
It's basically drinking beer

541
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,520
while doing things with cups and balls.

542
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,160
I'm not particularly good at this.

543
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,680
My husband really is

544
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,840
really really good at this.

545
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,570
But they take it very seriously.

546
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,400
Right. That far I know.

547
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,600
We got challenged by another section

548
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,600
after we had a negotiation seminar

549
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,160
and we kind of kicked their ass.

550
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,000
And they challenged us to beer olympics.

551
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,120
And we won.

552
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
But it was a very interesting experience.

553
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,240
We're all adults, right?

554
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,080
Harvard Business School,

555
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,560
the average age is like 28.

556
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,920
People are very serious.

557
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,000
And still we had a beer olympics.

558
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,720
I love it.

559
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,600
What's next on the journey then?

560
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,040
So consulting, products, data, IDF,

561
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,440
Harvard Business School.

562
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,920
I mean, where do you see your passion

563
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,840
takes you over the next,

564
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,960
I don't know, five or so years?

565
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,400
So, as I said before,

566
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,800
I'm really considering

567
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,880
and my current hypothesis is health care.

568
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,160
So probably post business school

569
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,400
would either be health care, tech,

570
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,080
or health care tech.

571
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,440
I'm still kind of trying to find

572
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,160
what would be the best place

573
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,280
right after business school,

574
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,080
but I think that down the line,

575
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,000
definitely starting

576
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,720
either my own or joining a great team

577
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,840
working on interesting health care issues

578
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,400
and trying to use technology and data

579
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,000
to solve those problems.

580
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,640
And having finished now the first year

581
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,800
of Harvard Business School,

582
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,040
I think that business school in general,

583
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,720
while the value of it

584
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,600
is not controversial,

585
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,160
but what is controversial right now

586
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,280
is sometimes you have companies

587
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,880
like Jolt in Israel who are saying,

588
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,640
"Well, we have an alternative to an MBA."

589
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,120
or they're, are at the end,

590
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,480
maybe going out in the real world

591
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,720
and doing stuff hands on

592
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,600
is a good also alternative to an MBA.

593
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,040
So, having finished that first year

594
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,520
and having this real world experience

595
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,240
in all these different sectors,

596
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,840
do you feel that this is something

597
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,760
that people who want

598
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,160
to grow their mindset on what are

599
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,080
the big global issues

600
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,360
and how to scale things.

601
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,840
Is this something really beneficial,

602
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,440
or is this more

603
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,720
for the personal experience

604
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,640
and to just be exposed to more things?

605
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,200
So I think that you can't separate both.

606
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,000
I think that at HBS, this cases,

607
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,600
So same question.

608
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,360
Experience versus. Go for it.

609
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,600
Yeah. So, I think that you can't separate

610
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,800
the extra-curricular experience

611
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,040
from the actual experience.

612
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,640
So coming to business school,

613
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,200
I moved to the US.

614
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,600
I got introduced into this

615
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
entirely different culture.

616
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,960
I learned from my 94 classmates

617
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,800
that come from all over the world.

618
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,240
This girl who was sitting next to me

619
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,600
was from Guatemala

620
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,680
and the other guy was from Kenya.

621
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,320
And some people are from the US.

622
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,280
Some people are from kind of the areas

623
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,640
that I've never been to in the US.

624
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,520
It's the social experience

625
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,920
and building your network

626
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,960
and getting to know people

627
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,080
that have different business experience

628
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,120
is not something

629
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,960
I'm not against Jolt.

630
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,840
I think it's great.

631
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,840
I just think it's kind of a different proposition

632
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,400
and a different experience.

633
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,720
Meeting the case protagonist of CEOs

634
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,360
from leading companies

635
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,360
is not something that you can kind of do

636
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,320
without this social interactions.

637
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,800
So I think being part of clubs,

638
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,280
me wanting to transition

639
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,320
to health care.

640
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,000
Being part of the health care club.

641
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Going to meet companies

642
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,080
in the Boston area.

643
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,920
I just feel like so many things

644
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,400
that I value about this experience

645
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,480
would've not happened

646
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,280
if I had gone for kind technical skills

647
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,320
at Jolt, which is awesome.

648
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,640
I'll probably do that in the future.

649
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,480
But it's just not,

650
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,040
I don't think it's a replacement

651
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,480
for one another.

652
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,040
So, what is the first step

653
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,880
for somebody who's now, I don't know,

654
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,320
they've had a few years experience

655
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,040
in the Israeli tech ecosystem

656
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,840
or other industries. And they say,

657
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,600
"Wow, I think I want to consider

658
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,160
going to business school.

659
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,680
Maybe Harvard or Stanford

660
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,600
are so far off.

661
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Maybe I shouldn't even try."

662
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,320
What is the first step that they should do

663
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,120
in your mind to get that path started?

664
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,840
I think they should ask themself

665
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,800
why they want to go to business school.

666
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,320
And then they should look at their resume

667
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,120
and past experience and understand

668
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,440
if they have an interesting

669
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,120
and compelling story to tell

670
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,280
that would want to make someone

671
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,760
from Harvard or Stanford have them

672
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,200
and they'll be

673
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,040
like a powerful contribution.

674
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
I think that's, in the end,

675
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,880
that what makes or breaks

676
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,720
a candidate for business school.

677
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,520
And I personally believe that

678
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,840
while everybody has a story,

679
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,680
sometimes it's hard to uncover it

680
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,240
and hard to realize that perhaps

681
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,600
some experience that you've had

682
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,880
a few years ago, which you sort of overlooked,

683
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,800
to a lot of others

684
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,880
it's a fascinating story

685
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,560
and you can distill

686
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,560
a lot of lessons from it.

687
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,840
And I think that what you mentioned,

688
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,480
a lot of groups

689
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,880
that are helping candidates

690
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,800
write their application.

691
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,360
It's not that they're inventing

692
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,240
their life story;

693
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,040
it's that they're helping them

694
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,000
take these stories,

695
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,520
putting them on paper in a way

696
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,160
that people in the US can read

697
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,950
and really adopt emotionally.

698
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,090
And relate.

699
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,760
And relate because, at the end,

700
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,720
our cultures are so different

701
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,120
and while there's a lot of similarities,

702
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,480
there's so many differences.

703
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,440
And I think that these consulting groups

704
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,560
are doing a fantastic job

705
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,320
at helping international students come in and

706
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,440
sort of reframe their stories

707
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,240
to the American mindset.

708
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,360
And it's not just to English,

709
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,160
but to American language.

710
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,120
But Hadas, on that note,

711
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,080
we do have to end.

712
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,800
But thank you so much

713
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,160
for being so generous with your time.

714
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,400
I have one last question: three words

715
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,120
that you would use to describe yourself.

716
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,960
Yes.

717
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,120
So I would use,

718
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,840
passionate, challenger, and doer.

719
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,480
Passionate, challenger, and doer.

720
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,200
I love it.

721
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,720
Hadas, toda raba.

722
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,360
Thank you very much.

723
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,840
Enjoy the second year of business school.

724
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,840
I hope that it's not gonna be

725
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,600
all online.

726
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,040
I hope that you go back to sitting

727
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
in that same spot

728
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,840
and hang that Israel flag back

729
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,000
in the back of the room.

730
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,960
And enjoy the rest of the quarantine.

731
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,840
I guess one more day.

732
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,680
Thank you, Michael.

733
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,640
And Shabbat shalom,

734
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,400
and good luck with your project.

735
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,640
Thank you very much.

736
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,000
Bye bye.
