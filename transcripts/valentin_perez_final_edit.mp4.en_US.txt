1 The question that me and my co-founder Max, Max Deutsch, ask ourselves was what type of life do we want to live? Right? And for us, the answer is we just want to spend time learning and creating, right? Valentin Perez, thank you so much for joining me on 20 minute leaders. How are you? Thank you, Michael. I'm doing great. How about you? I'm doing fantastic. Thank you so much for joining me and being so generous with your time. You're calling from Los Angeles and you're actually living with Cliff Weitzman who I believe was one of the first guests on the show which is pretty, pretty cool. Amazing, yeah. We're super cool friend. So, from Mexico, went to Brown University, co-president of the entrepreneurship program there, got into startups, worked in quite a few places, one of them as a software engineering intern at Snapchat, which I'd love to hear what that experience is all about. But now, most recently, you are the CEO and co-founder of Monthly, an online education platform focusing on month courses, right? Did I get that right? Yeah. The co-founder of Monthly, and we do one month hands-on online classes taught by big creators and artists. Amazing. Amazing. So, you know Valentin, before we get into really in the depth of monthly and what you're doing there, I'd love to go back a little bit and talk about your entrepreneurial journey and sort of the steps leading up to your endeavor right now. So, when would you consider you started as an entrepreneur? Oh, I would say since, like ever since I can remember. I was just always with the entrepreneurial mindset and I think it's because of the way that I grew up and the way that my parents raised me, like one of the earliest questions that I always remember my dad asking myself is, would you rather be the tail of a lion or the head of a mouse? And I would always ironically answer the head of a lion. But for him, he was always like asking that question kind of rhetorically, that it's better to be the head of a mouse, even if the small thing. You be the entrepreneur, the person like leading or having your own charge of your own destiny than being the tail of a bigger organization or some other group. So, ever since I was a kid, I was always working on projects, selling things, like building stuff, you know, websites, apps, robots, selling sushi across my neighborhood, like everything that you can imagine. Yeah. So, what was the motivation for it? Sorry? What was the motivation for doing all those projects? Was it simply to make money were some people sell lemonade in a lemonade stand or you did the other entrepreneur projects? Or was there other reasons why you went about them? Yeah, I mean, I think when I was a kid, it was mostly fun. It was just like I was just having fun playing around, that's what I found fun, fulfilling. And then it was also about sort of getting into creating value and helping other people, right? So, I see entrepreneurship is just literally the way like you're creating value and you're helping improve other people's lives. And then I think there is like, a fun, play, creating value, but a big part of it for me, too, is curiosity and like learning new things and understanding new parts of the world and that maybe as experimenting. I think some other motivators for me are love, just coming, like giving love, receiving love. Gratefulness, always being grateful about what I have and making the most out of the opportunities and chances that I have. And I think that creating value goes with the desire to be useful. Yeah, it's just creating value, love, gratefulness, curiosity, play, fun. Right. So, you're talking about creating value, love, curiosity. If I recall correctly, one of the things that you also did is send a newsletter with a bunch of gifts. Right? Talk to me a little bit about that newsletter. Yeah, so. One thing I love doing is curating things. So, ever since I was a kid, I had a list of my favorite quotes, or like a list of my favorite articles. And I always just stored all these things. And I love finding the gems in the Internet of, like, what are the best videos, what are the best articles, what are the best ideas, what are the best books. And I just like have a lot of fun doing this. And then, part of that is like I also joined a lot of newsletters. Like I spend a lot of time just learning things online and part of that was newsletters. And then I felt, you know, I'm storing all these things thinking to myself, why don't I just share all of these that I've accumulated, all of these amazing gems, articles, ideas, habits, etcetera, and just share them with my friends and family. So I just, you know, as an experiment I posted like, hey, would anyone be interested? And then I got like hundreds of messages and comments of people that wanted to get this newsletter and I just started sending it. And the premise was, you know, mouth-watering articles like juicy books. Yeah. It's like, provoke [--] pictures. So, it was like a cross, like many different types of media, all of them the best things that I can find. And it wasn't only things that I found throughout the week. It was like over the years and the whole lifetime of like creating all these things. Right? So, I focused on quality over recency. And I did sprinkle a bit of recency because part of my newsletter was also sending my favorite songs and new artist that I was finding. I also just love making Spotify plus, for example. And yeah, it was like part of the newsletter. And it actually was extremely fun and rewarding because it was a way to keep in touch with a ton of friends and family and people. I only have to write this email once and send it once a week and it gets to like hundreds of people. And then if anyone, if they're interested, they can reply or not. But I always had, like, people sharing back more thoughts, more ideas, like just having a conversation. There was just absolute blast. I think that's there's so much ingenuity in that. I took inspiration from a great friend of mine, Drew Bent. I don't know if you got to meet him, but he's a Knight-Hennessy scholar at Stanford. And he went to MIT launch with me. And he send out this year-end review Drew's Year-End Review as a one time once a year newsletter. And I started adopting that, doing it more quarterly or biannually. And it was amazing to see how with one email I can reach hundreds of people. And all of a sudden you get their responses and you're invigorating these connections. And I think that it's such a wonderful technique to get in touch with people. I'm obviously enjoying meeting new people and maintaining relationships through a show like this. So, I'm definitely in favor of all of these different endeavors. Talk to me a little bit about entrepreneurship at Brown University. What does it mean to be an American college student in America? You're from Mexico but you're studying college in America. And you're leading an entrepreneurship experience also for other students. What was that about? Yeah, so for me, I just, I knew that I wanted to get involved with the entrepreneurship scene even before I got into Brown. Once I got to Brown, like, that was like the first thing that I did. I joined the hackathon and the hackathon organizing team because I went to the hackathon as a high schooler before Brown. And so, I knew I want to be a part of that. And when I got to Brown, like, I knew that I wanted to continue working on my own entrepreneurial projects. But I also, I saw super valuable as like, you know, meeting all the other entrepreneurs, all the people interested in making things right. So, what better way than by taking the lead in the entrepreneurship club and finding these people, cultivating these people, and cultivating an environment that would be the best place for entrepreneurship, like that was my goal. I just want to make Brown and a college here that has Brown and RISD, the Rhode Island School of Design as the best place for entrepreneurship. Yeah, it was like a ton of fun. I founded four different conferences there, like founded like a speaker series like trips to San Francisco and New York to visit alumni. Like so many different things, like having 10x the group size, like double the budget of the entrepreneurship club, engage an alumni group. So, we have like an alumni presence interview a new and found a new direct, help find a new director for the new Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship, help think about the space and etc. So, I was super involved in that. And it was an absolutely super fulfilling experience and an amazing learning experience, because I saw it as a platform to practice entrepreneurship. And it was just amazing. And a platform to practice entrepreneurship, I think, it reminds me obviously of the program we both did at MIT launch. And it's all about practicing entrepreneurship. It's taking a sandbox that you can't really destroy anything, because the worst thing that could possibly happen is that you'll say, Okay, I tried, I failed. By the way, I'm still in high school/college. And it's not like I have children to feed or family to take care of, and I'll move on and take the lessons I learned. So how did that lead up now to Monthly? And what are you trying to do with the education space? Yeah, so with Monthly, what we're doing is we're revolutionizing how people learn online. Like this comes from, like I as a kid, like always my favorite thing is learning, right? Learning and creating things. So, the question, I was working on startup, working on projects, and then I realized that I could be working on anything. Like, I had the resources, I had the skills. So, the question that me and my co-founder, Max, Max Deutsch ask ourselves was, what type of life do we want to live? Right? And for us, the answer is we just want to spend time learning and creating. Right? That's what we love. And so, how can we build a system that allows us to live this life and allow other people to live this life as well. So, for us, it was like how do we build the learning platform of our dreams and who do we want to learn from? How do we make it as sociable, amazing experience? How do you make it so that you finish with tangible projects? So, for our classes, for example, all our classes, you finish with something tangible. So, in our music production class, you finish with three songs that you have created by the end of the month. In our painting class, you finish with a realistic portrait or like a painting that is inspired by your imagination and your background. You can finish with film, etc. And so, these classes, they're different from the normal online classes. Normal online classes, usually, there might be just a playlist of videos that you watch. But our classes have a specific start date and an end date. All of them are one month, hence the name, Monthly. And throughout the experience, you're put into a peer group of 20 other students from around the world. Right.? So, you can invite friends to be in the same peer group, but you're in the social experience where you will see what other people are working on. You can get feedback, you receive feedback, you see, you get inspired, make new friends. And this peer group also came from, at Brown, I started a group called, [--] where every Saturday we would meet at my house in the living room, and we would just talk about life and things that we were learning. And it was just such an intimate, amazing environment and I wanted to replicate that within Monthly. So, hence instead of seeing a class that you have like 2000 students and you don't really connect with anyone, we split into peer groups so you can connect with the 20 peers that you're learning with. And by the end of the month, you get a feedback. The creator and the instructor is also interacting with the students. And then you all finish with something that you share. So, everyone finishes with something that I can't help but share with all my friends, family, social media. And then that just brings in a lot more people in. That's amazing. So, just to understand a little bit better, the context of where Monthly, the market the monthly is in, so, are these mainly for young adults or kids that want to acquire a new skill, a specialized skill, that you then provide a month long course that is very intimate, intensive, and then by the end of which they finish with a tangible product? Is that what you're doing? Yes. Our audience is actually, you know, we've seen people that are eight year olds to seven year olds, 70 year olds, it's like a huge range of everyone is interested because our classes are singing, music production, art, even creative engineering and etc. We have a big range of topics. But you're right that the main demographic is young adults. Mostly, they might want to improve their skill, but also a lot of the times, they're just, there in their corporate job and they want to do something more with their life. They want to do something creative, they want to do something cool, they want to do something exciting, or they want to be a part of a community. And this is what we're providing to people. And we see that, you know, it's transforming people's lives. People finish the class and they're like, wow, this has been the most productive 30 days of my life. Or I've learned more in this past month than the past ten years trying to learn to make music. And these are quotes from video testimonials. At this point, we have thousands of video testimonials, people who went out of the way to record themselves of how much they love their experience and posted to YouTube. And it's just been super inspirational to see and to see what people are creating, the connection that they're making. And, it's crazy to see that our completion rates for people to finish their classes are 10x the industry averages for other online platforms. Really? Yeah. Why do you think that is? What is the factor? Yeah. I think it's a combination of factors, right? So, one, these classes, you see the end like you see what you're working towards. We frame the classes. Now this music production class, you're going to finish with three songs, right? And everything in the curriculum is structured to help you achieve that and get to that point, right? So, all the videos, like the projects, the feedback sessions, and they all build progressively towards the final projects. So, that's one thing. The other thing is the social aspect. You're in a peer group where you see that other people are submitting the projects, like watching the video. So, like monkey see, monkey do. Like humans are, like if they see how people doing this, they don't want to let them down. Even though they may be strangers, but they're in your peer group. They're like, you're going to get assigned for feedback. It also helps people. There's deadlines, and the deadlines are not just arbitrary. They're actually, in this case are useful because if you submit in time the next day, you're going to get feedback. If not, you may not get because you didn't submit. So that, then obviously the classes are framed. That's like a commitment. So, it's not just maybe I'll just like pay for some subscription service that like maybe I'll get to this later. Like it usually never happens. This is like a month and you're going to commit and there's a start date and a finish date. So, mentally people are prepared for that and the prices are also high. Right? So, there's various reasons why we wanted raise the prices high. One of them is for the commitment. Like we want people to actually commit and follow through and finish their classes. So, the classes are priced around usually $279. So, people are serious about it and they enroll and they go for it. I think that's super, super cool. Yeah. and like the instructors that we get, there are always big name people who already have big audiences are very charismatic in the way that they teach. So, people are always engaged. The curriculum that we design is very much like, we spend a lot of time being very meticulous about how we design a very effective, engaging curriculum. So, that also helps. I think it's just like such a big combination of things. Well, what surprised you the most out of the journey? Or even more interesting than that, what lessons did you take with you from your prior entrepreneurial experiences that you're saying like, wow, I'm so glad that I had these experiences at Brown and at MIT launch and as a kid, that now I've just started saying, oh, I've seen this, I've experienced this, this is how I want to tackle this? Yeah. I mean, great question. I think there's just endless things and ideas that you can learn from, even from mistakes, from successes or anything, I think you can learn. I think, are you looking for like a specific like nuggets of advice or like specific experience that happened? I'd love to know how you see your prior entrepreneurial experience folding into or molding into Monthly? Because a lot of people are saying, yeah, I'll defer entrepreneurship to when I'm good and ready, I'll accumulate professional experiences and then I'll be an entrepreneur. And here you have an example of somebody who's been an entrepreneur their whole life leading up to this moment. Oh, yeah, well, I mean, I think it's there, like, I just I see anything that comes up with Monthly, has come up like most cases like before. Or even if they hasn't come up, you have the muscle and the exercise of being able to figure new things out. And a lot of it is like pattern recognition. There are a lot of patterns, even though that might be slightly different. It's like slightly similar to other things you've done before. So, that exercise and practice of entrepreneurship, I think is like extremely valuable and fun and rewarding and everything that you want and useful for later on. I just see it everywhere. Like, you know, one thing is with working with a team and leading people, I think that was huge when I was a president at Brown. Others like how do you figure out, how do you code an app and what needs to get built? For all the apps that I had before Monthly, under my time at Brown and before Brown, I think I had seven apps in the App Store. So, I was like very familiar with the launch process. And then other learning experiences was like, you know, I built something really cool. But then I realized that even though the thing was really cool, it's not going to get to anyone's hands if there's no distribution. Right? So, learning about distribution and learning about like not talking to users and reading between the lines, I think a lot of times you may ask a question, people may say something, but they're really meaning something else or they have a deeper desire or they're trying to satisfy. So, it's a lot about building up that intuition to being able to identify these things. I love it. If you were to ask what people wanted, they would have said, faster horses. Right. Right. 100%. Valentin, I'm sad that we only have 20 minutes for this show, but thank you for being so generous with your time. Before we finish, what are three words that you would use to describe yourself. Good question. One, let's say understander. I love to understand things, it's like my favorite thing with learning, thing that I like is understanding. And so understanding about the world, about myself, about people, about concepts, everything. I just love understanding. Second one is "differinker". And this is like a made up word because basically I just made it up. It means like "different thinker". I love to think differently. I like love to just go off the beaten path, like come up with new words, new ideas, new ways of doing things. And that's something that represents that. And then the third one is "slow-B", is also made up word, which means that I love focusing on slope more than a Y intercept. And this comes from a quote that I love is, "a little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y intercept". Right? So, Y intercept is, where you may be right and that like, if you see two lines, like I may not have it be able to draw this, but usually, what matters most is the slope. Even if you started, there's a line that started up here. The slope is like this. If you started down here, the slope is like this. It'll cross it in short amount of time. So, I think as long as you're focusing on growth and learning, then you can get to anywhere. 100%. And I think that it's even more relevant when you're thinking, people often say that, look, somebody else is already doing this or somebody else is starting off at a different stage than I am. And it's not about the stage of starting off. It's a marathon. It's not a sprint. It's about how, it's about the slope, the slope of your trajectory, not about the starting point that's both takes over very, very quickly. Valentin, thank you very, very much. Enjoy your time in Los Angeles with Cliff. Stay safe and stay healthy. And thank you for being on the show. Thank you, Michael, Thank you for hosting. Take care.
