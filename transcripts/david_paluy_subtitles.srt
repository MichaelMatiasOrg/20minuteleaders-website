1
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,800
David, thank you for joining me 
and giving me your time.

2
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Thank you, Michael. 
Nice to meet you.

3
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
How are you doing? 
So you're talking to me

4
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
from Dallas?
From Austin, actually, right

5
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes. Correct. How are you?

6
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,300
And you just moved here --

7
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,300
you moved there 
before the corona started?

8
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,300
Actually, in between. 
I had the last flight from Israel

9
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,300
to United States.

10
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,300
The last one?

11
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,300
The last one, Delta flight, yes.

12
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,300
Wow! Okay.

13
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,000
It's a good thing, you got the last one. 
How is it over there right now?

14
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Is it crazy?

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,500
It depends.

16
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Everything is compelled. 
We have some friends in New York

17
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
and they suffered really hard.

18
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,000
- Oh, yeah.
- And compared to them, we are  in a

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,500
pretty good situation right now.

20
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
Definitely. Okay. 
So the most important thing

21
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,500
to know is that I'm speaking here 
to an optimist, which is great.

22
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,500
I love that, and you consider 
yourself  well-versed

23
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
in what it means
to bring happiness

24
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
to consumers.

25
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
That's my little dog here, Benny, 
who might make an appearance.

26
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
So we'll just let him 
set aside for a little bit

27
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
before he gets us into trouble

28
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
I'd love to sort of walk through

29
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,500
a little bit about your history 
your background, and how you got

30
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
excited about this topic.

31
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,000
I would love to talk to you 
also a little bit about on

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,500
what it means to have a startup --

33
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
You're the CTO of a startup
in the travel space --

34
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
marketplace in the travel space,

35
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,500
and it's pretty challenging times 
for these sorts of companies now.

36
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
So maybe you can touch on that
a little at the end.

37
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,000
- Sure.
- So let's just get started.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,600
Tell me a little bit 
about yourself.

39
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,000
My name is David. 
I was born in Russia.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,600
We just moved to Israel 
when I was 12.

41
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Since 2016, I worked a lot 
with glass companies.

42
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,600
I actually started my career 
at a company called NDS.

43
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:58,600
I build various security solutions 
for digital TV,

44
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
more like projects for DIRECTV,
BSkyB, and some other big

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
corporate clients.

46
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:12,600
I moved to my own business, 
my own startups in 2010.

47
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Since that period,

48
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,600
I had an experience working on
different products

49
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,600
from financial industry, 
advertising, et cetera.

50
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,000
I was part of 
NFX Guild accelerator

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,500
in Palo Alto 
four years ago, actually.

52
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Was co-founder 
of Free Startups Board,

53
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
with  many different 
other startups

54
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
as well as Fortune 500 companies.

55
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,500
I joined Stride a year ago,

56
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
a bit more than a year ago.

57
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Right now, we are
in a pretty interesting

58
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
and challenging times.

59
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Yeah.

60
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,000
But we do believe 
that we will create

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,500
a serious impact for

62
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,500
people when all this madness, 
over and --

63
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Definitely.   
People will --

64
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,500
definitely want to go 
to some great Safari tours

65
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,000
or some interesting experience 
in Himalayas

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
or some amazing tours

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,500
that they are like dreaming 
right now all the time.

68
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,500
And we will help them 
to make it real soon.

69
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
As a company?

70
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Yes.

71
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,500
Oh, wonderful, wonderful! 
That's amazing. I actually did --

72
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
I did a --

73
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
I went to Kilimanjaro

74
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,500
a few months ago with my family 
as well as the Safari,

75
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,000
and it was one of the most 
extraordinary experiences

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
that I've ever had.

77
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Tell me a little bit 
about yourself and why

78
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,500
you consider yourself an optimist

79
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,500
and what makes you take about 
bringing happiness to consumers?

80
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,500
I work a lot on B to B projects 
and different projects

81
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,500
that didn't make me feel --

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,500
they help me to 
get pretty good money on one side

83
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,000
and I also invest it in some other 
startup as well, but it's not

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,500
something that creates meaning
in your life and it doesn't

85
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
provide any serious value

86
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,500
if you really want to move forward

87
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
to build something that, actually,

88
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,500
you want to wake up for 
and move yourself over.

89
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,500
When I was a kid, I asked 
my mother what does it mean

90
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,500
being happy. 
And I got the following answer

91
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:36,500
from her, "When you wake up early 
in the morning, you are happy

92
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
to go to work and in the evening, 
you're happy to go home."

93
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,500
This was her definition 
of happiness.

94
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
I try to define it myself.

95
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,500
I'm probably still working 
on this and my wife always

96
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,500
joking at me like, 
"Are you talking about happiness?

97
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,500
You're still struggling to define it 
for yourself.

98
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,000
How can you actually provide 
happiness to others?"

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So try to, first of all,
find it in yourself

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and this kind of [unclear 07:03.8] 
I actually recommend

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
to all other people―

102
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,500
entrepreneurs and just people

103
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
who want to work 
in a great environment.

104
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
- Yeah.
- First of all,

105
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
starting from your own 
personal life.

106
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Define what does it mean 
happiness for yourself.

107
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,000
- Is it --
- Sure.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,500
really something that

109
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,500
matters to you at all? 
Can you take it from there?

110
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Just an example on myself,

111
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
like what does it mean

112
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
I have been happy 
for myself, right?

113
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,500
So spending time 
with people I like

114
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,000
and people I love. 
My family, for example.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I do like helping other as well.

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,500
I highly believe in solidarity 
and it's a great example right now

117
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,700
in those crazy times that people 
share some food that

118
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,700
they bought and some masks

119
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,700
and helping each other.
It's something that make

120
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,700
a huge impact.

121
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,700
And on a personal level,

122
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,700
integrity is something 
that's really important as well.

123
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,700
Those are my points, my matters.

124
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,700
When you go to your job, 
for example,

125
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,700
what matters to you, like --

126
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,700
what kind of people 
you would like to work with?

127
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,700
I can give an example.

128
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,000
I personally like working 
with people who are doers,

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,700
who are actually --

130
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,700
can deliver something.

131
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,700
I do want to be 
in a supporting environment,

132
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,300
people who help each other 
and don't blame each other

133
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,700
like, "This is your fault," 
and et cetera, et cetera.

134
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,700
It's really important that people 
respect each other as well.

135
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:42,700
It's critical to have 
really great relationships

136
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,700
in the company as well.

137
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,700
And the entrepreneur mindset,

138
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,700
it's something that 
also makes me happy.

139
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,700
And when we are moving 
the same pattern to product,

140
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,700
what do you like 
about your product?

141
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,000
or like a --

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
- Right. 
- great user experience, right?

143
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,500
You do want that the product 
you are using or making

144
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
share some common values with you.

145
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:16,700
The product must be aligned with 
your values that you believe in.

146
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,700
And if it's something that

147
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,700
you don't believe, 
you will never use it, right?

148
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,700
Right.

149
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,700
On another part, 
when you build a product,

150
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
you want real to fans.

151
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,700
And when you make 
like a significant impact,

152
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:39,700
you will have those fans 
and they have some feelings

153
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,700
about your products.

154
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,000
And let's say, 
you release something

155
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,500
they didn't like, they respond.

156
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
"Listen, we didn't like this, 
and we didn't like that,

157
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,500
but we really want this back," 
and so on.

158
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,000
They will try to convince you
that this type of product needs

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,700
to be updated or changed, 
and so on.

160
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,700
The worst part for any product

161
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,700
is people who don't really 
care about it at all, like,

162
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,700
"This product is 
indifferent to me," like

163
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
"Today, you are a hero, 
that's fine.

164
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,700
We are fighting on
 just the price and that's it.

165
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,700
And tomorrow, 
someone else will just

166
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,700
improve their supply chain 
and reduce some pricing cost and --"

167
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,700
There is no product at all like --

168
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
And your company just goes away.

169
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,700
Right.

170
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,700
Those kind of things 
that really matter,

171
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,700
I highly recommend for any person

172
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,700
who is involved in product 
building, product definition,

173
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,700
first of all, start from your life. 
Move to your work definition

174
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,700
and then, move to product. 
And by this, you can actually

175
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,700
define all of the process yourself.

176
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,700
No, that makes a lot of sense.

177
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,700
I do agree on 
a lot of points here.

178
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,700
I think this idea of resilience 
and what allows you to

179
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,700
to keep going and even when 
the going gets tough,

180
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,300
and you know, 
having those users aligned

181
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,700
with your core values.
And when your product

182
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,700
shares those core values, 
then the users are not just

183
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,000
buying your product,
but they're, all of a sudden,

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,720
becoming champions of it, 
and they feel personally

185
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,700
attached to it.

186
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,700
Actually,

187
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,700
I did a little bit 
of research before

188
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,000
and I think you have 
a pretty interesting story

189
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
of a bicycle accident, right?

190
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,300
Did I see correct?

191
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,700
Yeah.

192
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,300
You broke both your hands 
and you managed to still do

193
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,700
something interesting 
while breaking both of your hands.

194
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,700
Yeah, it's a long story about that.

195
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,700
I had some accident
 and I was in some

196
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,700
like crazy situation 
seven, eight years ago, actually.

197
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,700
Yeah. I had to recover 
myself personally,

198
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,700
financially, and just everywhere.

199
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,700
And it was a very
challenging situation.

200
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,700
One person that probably 
really helped me to move over

201
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,000
this situation was my wife, 
and she actually helped me,

202
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,700
and she was extremely supportive 
beyond this period of time.

203
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,700
And you always need this person.

204
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Some other people that I got all 
the inspiration from,

205
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,700
more people that were around me.

206
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,700
They actually helped 
me to move forward,

207
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,700
and it's pretty 
important situation.

208
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,300
- And the --
- And that you actually --

209
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,700
during that time, 
you learned Ruby on Rails, right?

210
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,700
Not exactly.

211
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,700
I actually had previously 
experienced using Ruby on Rails.

212
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:42,700
I think it was version 1.8 
at the NDS, that time.

213
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,700
And I started checking 
what's going on

214
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
in the market right now?

215
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,700
Where can I go next?

216
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,700
Like what should I do?

217
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,700
I had like a very serious 
bicycle accident.

218
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,700
I should move over.

219
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,700
I wasn't able really to write 
a code at that time

220
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,700
because I was fully disabled.

221
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,700
And I said, "Okay."

222
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:15,700
I know that Ruby on Rails 
has like a very serious impact

223
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
on many startups at the time.

224
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,700
Right.

225
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,300
And Basecamp was developed 
during this period

226
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,300
and some other great startups.

227
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,300
And I said like, 
"I have to move this software."

228
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,300
This software actually helps 
a lot of developers

229
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,300
just to build great stuff, 
and I can move forward.

230
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,300
I started learning just by doing.

231
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:45,700
At the same time, 
the demand just became very high

232
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,700
and I started helping 
other startups

233
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,700
and move forward 
from this period. Yeah.

234
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,700
And so, you became a consultant
on Ruby on Rails?

235
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,300
I also did some consulting, 
not only for startups

236
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,300
but I worked with a company
like Conduit and some other

237
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,700
big companies as well.
I worked with Gartner in New York

238
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,700
and Whitewater Cooper House 
in San Francisco,

239
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,700
- and it's cool.
- Sure.

240
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,300
So I actually had startup 
experience as well as

241
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
Fortune 500 as well.

242
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
So tell me a little bit about

243
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,700
Stride and what are 
some of the core values

244
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,700
that you have over there 
that are aligned with yours

245
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,700
that bring happiness to users?

246
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,700
First of all, 
being in travel industry

247
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,700
is great thing to deal with, 
right?

248
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
it's something that --

249
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:45,700
you always like to travel 
unless you prefer sitting

250
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,700
on your couch and just --

251
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,500
Yeah.

252
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,700
watch TV or Netflix, 
or whatever.

253
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,700
But most people do like 
travelling, especially,

254
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
in those crazy times.

255
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,700
So I am very aligned

256
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,300
with the major goal

257
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,700
helping people to find exactly

258
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,000
where they can go right now,
what type of experience

259
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,700
they can get in various places 
around the world,

260
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:16,700
not only just on the next street 
or just around you but all over.

261
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,700
-- Yeah.
-- And this is something that we

262
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,700
are trying to achieve 
by helping people

263
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,700
to move all around,

264
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,700
get to know many different jobs
around the world,

265
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,700
and move forward.

266
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,700
And this is probably 
the most interesting part

267
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,700
in Stride that we are 
working on right now.

268
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,700
And so, what is it like 
being a CTO

269
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
of an upcoming startup,
and all of a sudden,

270
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,700
corona breaks out?

271
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,700
Good question.

272
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,700
It's charged on -- 
Listen, there are

273
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,700
always ups and downs, 
and it highly depends

274
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,700
if you have enough time 
with your cash

275
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,700
on a personal level, 
as well as on the company level.

276
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,700
Yeah.

277
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,700
Sometimes, you have to make
immediate decisions

278
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,700
like some people 
you have to lay out or fire,

279
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
or just pull some projects,

280
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,700
specifically concentrate 
on cash.

281
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,700
It's probably the 
most important one.

282
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,700
Measure everything 
you're doing many times a day

283
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,700
starting from planning.

284
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,700
Is the thing that you are working 
right now

285
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,700
really matters to you 
and to your customers?

286
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,700
Will this something 
that will make a change

287
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,700
in the upcoming months?

288
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:39,700
How people actually going to
spend their time on travel

289
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,700
after the coronavirus pass?

290
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,700
Will they actually travel abroad 
or they try to stay around?

291
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,700
So there are a lot of questions

292
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,700
that we are trying to 
answer right now.

293
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,700
And I assume that nobody 
actually knows the true answer.

294
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,700
Definitely. Right.

295
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,700
But we will see.

296
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:02,700
It's an interesting time. 
It's an interesting challenge.

297
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:08,700
And we're here to make it work.

298
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,700
I'm optimistic by my nature,

299
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,300
because being pessimistic 
doesn't provide any value.

300
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,700
And you need some personal 
balance in your life

301
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,700
just to move forward.

302
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,700
- Right.
- And it's something that

303
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,700
pretty important.

304
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,700
How important is it 
do you think to be an optimist

305
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,700
in a leadership team, whether 
it's a startup or a big company

306
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,700
rather than being the pessimist 
or the realist that is always

307
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,700
trying to give
the bad side to things?

308
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,700
Because there are balancing 
personalities that I would find

309
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,700
useful also in our leadership team.

310
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,700
All right. 
Sometimes,

311
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,700
you see being too optimistic 
is not always good,

312
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,700
like you're trying to oversell 
yourself too much.

313
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,700
You're trying to bring too much 
promises without actually

314
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,700
providing any value, 
and it's not good.

315
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,700
At some point, 
it just creates a negative impact.

316
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,700
On the other side, 
you always should be

317
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,700
more optimistic than 
realist or pessimist,

318
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,700
I don't know, 
and be prepared because --

319
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:25,700
the future is bright and we 
want to go to something happy,

320
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,700
and dealing with something 
that doesn't really matter at all.

321
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,700
It doesn't provide any motivation.

322
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,700
Right.

323
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,700
These are [unclear 18:33.3] 
to your team

324
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,700
and it doesn't provide 
like any serious value.

325
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,700
- I think
- Right.

326
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,700
every entrepreneur 
must be optimistic

327
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,700
in some way; otherwise, 
nobody really can survive it.

328
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:55,700
When I'm a startup founder, 
I wake up every morning. I decide,

329
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,700
"This is the experiment 
that I'm going to do today."

330
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,700
At the end of the day,
this experiment will fail

331
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,700
and the next morning,
I have to wake up with the same

332
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,700
attitude that I am going to make 
experiment number two.

333
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,700
And this experiment 
may fail as well

334
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,700
this is a startup life 
and it's crucial

335
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:23,700
for you to survive this kind of 
trial and error routine.

336
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,700
And being optimistic  
is a must have.

337
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:31,700
How do you then delegate 
that happiness

338
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,300
and optimism to the people 
that work under you as a CTO,

339
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,700
because you're not necessarily the 
one who's writing all the code,

340
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,700
and a lot of the times, you have 
to also put on this product

341
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,700
tag and you have to bring 
a lot of that down, you know,

342
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,700
top-down for the team. 
What are some of the ways

343
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,300
that you do that?

344
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
Great question.

345
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,700
So, you really need
 to split your tough --

346
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,700
your stories into 
like small chunks, small tasks.

347
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,700
And this actually helps 
to deliver faster

348
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,700
and make frequent delivers 
actually helps the team

349
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,700
move forward.

350
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,700
Right.

351
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,700
This type of development 
mindset actually helps a lot

352
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,300
because, let's say, 
if you decide on building

353
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:22,700
a product with a huge amount 
of features and a big list

354
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,700
of requirements on it's own, 
nobody really can deliver it,

355
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,700
but if you just split it 
into small chunks of requirements,

356
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,000
and every time you build 
something, you deliver it,

357
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,700
you test it immediately, 
you get the impact, and so on.

358
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,700
- This actually helps 
- Definitely.

359
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,700
people who works with you 
move forward

360
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
and see the real impact.

361
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,700
And every line of code 
should have  an impact.

362
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,700
If the line --

363
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,700
Nobody writes code just to like --

364
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,700
as beautiful code. 
It really doesn't matter like seriously.

365
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,700
- Right.
- Sometimes,

366
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:07,700
you just have to realize 
real people actually enjoy

367
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,700
having this situation. 
It doesn't matter if you work

368
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,700
on a client right now or you're 
building some back office.

369
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:20,700
Just put on your hand 
the same person

370
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,700
and try to do the same process.

371
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,700
_ It doesn't --
- Definitely.

372
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,700
make you happy, 
just using this smaller project.

373
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,700
It's something that I always 
request from developers.

374
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
Just try to use it yourself.

375
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,700
They will actually use it, 
like literally.

376
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,300
You don't need a designer, you 
don't need a user experience guy.

377
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,700
And so, just be the user yourself.

378
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,700
Definitely, definitely.

379
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,700
So we have to -- 
our 20 minutes is coming up,

380
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,700
but I'd like to ask you 
the final question.

381
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
And it's putting you 
a little bit on the spot.

382
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
But what are three words 
that you would best

383
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,700
describe you as?

384
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,700
I already know 
at least one of them.

385
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,700
But what are the three that you 
would best describe yourself as?

386
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,700
Optimist is one of those.

387
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:14,700
I like helping people 
is the second one,

388
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:20,700
and I'm entrepreneur, 
like traveling and move forward.

389
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,700
That's really, really great. 
David, thank you very, very much.

390
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,700
- Thank you.
- It was great.

391
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,700
- Great. Take care.
- Bye-bye.

392
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,700
Bye-bye. It was wonderful, really. 
Thank you.
