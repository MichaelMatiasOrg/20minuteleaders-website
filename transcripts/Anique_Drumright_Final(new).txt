1 What do our end users actually want? Are we making it better? Are we building a platform that will stand up? What is right? What is that? What are we doing? Why are we doing it? How does it connect to our vision? And then it's ultimately like, are we delivering it? I'm so glad to have you here. All the way from Uber, TripActions, now Loom, and Teach for America before. I can't wait to talk about Product, VP of Product roles, and really, your insights into those various industries. But before we start on all of that, I want to go all the way back to Georgetown, you're playing rugby. And how that has you know, hinted towards your life as VP of Product? I mean, I've been a big believer in team sports in my entire childhood. So, I've played more soccer in my lifetime than rugby. And then I went to college and I just wanted to pick up something new, be part of a team sport. So, I found myself up on the rugby team on my freshman year. It was super fun. I still remember my first try. It was like, I caught the ball and I just remember the coach be like, "Run, run, run." And I'm like, "I'm running." It's great. You have no idea what you do and you're like, "I wish to do my best." "I'll be sprinting." We don't have much rugby in Israel. But rugby is the sport where eventually just everybody is piling on top of each other over this, you know, cone-shaped ball. Right? Yeah. It's like huge in, it's huge in Australia and South Africa. It's pretty popular in New York as well. But anyways, so then after college, I really wanted to do something that mattered. And I just thought, Teach for America would be a great place to contribute. I had had the joys of like a great public education system. And obviously I went to a really strong private university for college. And I just, I wanted to contribute. And I wanted to do something with high levels of ownership and something that mattered. And so, I was lucky to be selected to be part of Teach for America. So, what is Teach for America? What is the sort of impact you're trying to make on the public education space? Yeah, sorry, that's a great question. I should start there. So, Teach for America is, it's been around for over 25 years now. It is a non-profit that takes high performing leaders from quite a bit directly out of undergraduate university. But some put collegiate and places them into high need school districts. So, the public education system in the United States does have a teacher shortage and a teacher recruitment shortage. And so, I partners with high performing leaders puts them through a distinct training. And then you work in high need schools. And so, what were your various roles? Because you've done quite a few things within Teach for America. But it's not like you came in and said, "Okay, I'm going to be a teacher, I'm going to help others in one capacity." But you really branched out and did quite a few different things. And I'm especially curious for that because, you know, looking from your journey from an outsider, you're saying, okay, you wanted to go study in sort of politics government in Georgetown. And then you go into Teach for America. And then you find yourself, you know, going straight into high tech at full speed, both at really big companies like Uber, then to medium size companies like hyper growth, like TripActions, and now to Loom, which is more of a startup scene. Right? So, I'm really curious to hear about the journey and how you sort of paved this road. Yeah. I mean, so, a core belief of Teach for America is "teaching is leadership". And I think that, I didn't know at the time that like, learning about teaching and working at Teach for America was preparing me in many ways for what I do now. You learn, how do you get people excited to go after big goals? How do you break it down into medium goals? How do you build a culture? How do you keep going even when things get hard? And like, the results are coming in and you need to change course. Like that is all, I mean, those are some of the many things that product organizations do. And it's the same in a classroom. And so, I think it was a really good foundation in terms of building ownership, taking tough blows. Teaching is so hard, and then continuing to keep going. And when I left Teach for America, I had joined the team in Dallas and had been working on developing Proofpoint schools with, sort of attracting school leaders and high caliber teachers, and in trying to work with the district to make Proofpoint schools. But I just wanted to, I was really young and you know, things were moving really fast, career wise. And I just realized that I wanted to experience something different. I wanted to challenge my brain in different ways. So, I tried to applied for Uber, got into Uber and then kind of navigated the company to get to what I was like, ultimately more interested in, which was on the product side. And then from there, I joined TripActions. And the way that I found TripActions was, I basically went through a process of like, Okay, who are VCs I believe in. I have to understand the problem. Like, I want to be excited by the problem. And then I met Ariel and Ilan, and then it was kind off to the races. And I had also looked for startups that had ex Uber executives. You know, Uber is a mixed bag. You know, 2014, 2015, 2016, Uber, they're like highs and lows from a culture standpoint. But I do think it was rigorous and bold and courageous. And there were, you know, negative attributes as well. That coin is double sided. But like, when I first joined there, we all believed in it so much. And I knew that I wanted to work at a company, that that belief was like fully there. Right. And so, then I joined TripActions when we were 40 people. I had no idea that it would like, scale. And so, yeah, I was the first product manager. Amazing. So, first product manager, but actually pretty quickly then becoming Head of Product and then VP of Product. And how many people were TripActions by the time that you left? So, when I joined, we were a series-A, 40 people. When I left, we were 1200 valued at four billion. And my team went from just me, to then running the design or really building the design and product organization, to about 27, split between Palo Alto and Amsterdam. Unbelievable. Why Amsterdam? That was more of an engineering-driven decision. There had been another, well no. Amsterdam, because from an operations standpoint, we had set up a support team. And then our CTO had flown out there and had met with a startup that was very talented in the travel space. And so, then he made the decision from an engineering perspective, we're going to hire there. There's also like a ton of tax incentives in Amsterdam. It's like Amsterdam and Dublin, very interesting for startup But anyways, so, it was mostly like the operations team had set up and then our CTO had gone out and had met like a team of pretty talented engineers. And so then, it just became kind of a natural decision. Also, because TripActions is both a product and an operations company. Right. And good for your tech team to be close with the support team or your operations team. Your customer success team, your sales team, there's just a ton of empathy that's developed. So, it was kind of a win all around, both from a product and engineering and a support perspective. What were some of the most both challenging and exhilarating things about moving from a, you know, one person team really to now, almost a 30 person team? But more importantly than that, being a part of the incubation of what would become a 1200 person, four billion dollar company, which I'm assuming as one of the first people working on product in the company, you've gotten to see really the vision and strategy unfold along the way, as you made those transitions. So, I'd love to sort of pick your brain and fast forward during these years. But really understand, what were some of those insights that you gained throughout this time? I mean, I think the first ones that come to mind, and since you didn't send me the questions ahead of time, I have to just go off the cuff. The first is like, as you begin to build a team, the people you bring in are so exciting. Right. I think about some of the product managers that I hired, that I mentored, that I learned from, and it's just so fun, you know. Yeah. And I think, that is just like a very inspiring piece of a company growing. And then I think the second piece from a product perspective that I learned in spades at TripActions is like, you should always be responding to the market. Right. Like if you want to be winning and if you want to be a true partner to your customers, because TripActions and Loom are both B2B2C, like you need to be both over delivering and also have a pulse on how things are changing. Right. So, how do you then, as VP of Product have that pulse? How do you wake up every day, and by the way, one of the questions that before we start, you're asking, "How do you edit these videos? What software you use?" I guess that's part of the VP product mentality of constantly doing that market research. But what is your, sort of engaged responsibility with the market? How do you tangibly go about executing on it every single day as you're aligning the strategy? And when Ariel and Ilan are saying, "Okay, we'll Anique, what is the next product we should build?" then, how do you even go about thinking of that new and innovative vision? It's a good question. I mean, I think part of it is being pretty diligent about always being in front of customers. So, like, if I look at my week and I'm not like in the field at least twice, I'll like, being customer success in sales and be like, this is a lonely week. Like I need to get out there. And what does that mean, Anique? What does that mean to get in front of that customer? Is it literally, you picking up the phone and calling customers? Is that you going to meet ups or Zooms? I push in on customer calls and sales calls. And I also, if we're going to lose a deal or if this was like, if there's something at risk, I want to know from it. Because, one, it's my responsibility, but also because there's so much learning to happen. But still about this, you know, jumping in, being responsible of them, they're still learning, that's part of both leadership, but it's also a part of, you understanding that it's a process. And, you know, you have to learn from every experience. So, from your insights, what are some of the most important things that a product manager can take with them as they're building other product and strategy and growing in the ranks, as regards to a company's product? I mean, I think the first is like curiosity. I think one of the mistakes that product managers, that it's funny when I join as a customer into product meetings, that I face sometimes is product managers being defensive of their product. You're seeing uncomfortable, right? You're like, "Oh, it's criticizing." And so, that art of listening and balancing being empathetic and being genuinely curious, while also taking ownership and taking responsibility of the product that you've developed, I think it's a really, you know, it's a balance that everyone is trying to constantly get better at. Right. And there's definitely times where I hop up calls where I'm like, I didn't listen enough. Or I should have asked more open ended questions than I did. What is the difference between open ended versus closed ended questions, from a product management perspective? So, let's say that I'm now, you know, I'm the founder of an early stage company and I'm trying to get my validation or I'm trying to get some insight into whatever I'm building, what would be a key indicator whether I'm asking the right questions? Because I think that that's both something that I need to get better at. But I think that it's also something that I see quite frequently that people don't ask enough open ended questions when they're doing their research. It's like asking, do you use X tool versus tell me about how you edit your videos? Right? You're going to get so much more information. You're going to learn about their workflow, what their technique is. And you want to know all of that information. You want to like be consistently learning about it. Right. Because that will inspire future decisions. I think building that gut and that instinct is so important. And we've talked a lot about customer calls, but it's also like, you know, one of my, like strongest product managers in my current team is like, we should just be using different video services every week. Just like constantly be like just building our gut. Because I don't think you can be curious enough. Right. And also, like, what are other products that you're using daily or that other people are using and what makes you love them. Can you be conscious of that. When you're signing on to you're like, we are using Riverside.FM, there was I clicked a button and there was a great user feedback. So, I took a picture and screenshot it and sent it to PM. So, that's why it took me a second to get on. Right? It's like, can you constantly be building that instinct of what makes great product? Right. Because different people are really strong at different things. So, it's like what's going on in the actual market, right, like the investor market, competitors? What's going on with your customers, to your sales, to your support team? Like make sure you're getting in there. And you actually should be on the calls. And then the third piece is just like learning from different types of products. 100%. And I think, by the way, that one of the things that I enjoy most about these open ended questions, even more than quantity of information, it's the surprise element that when I hear something that I didn't expect or that I thought that, that wasn't going to come out of their mouth, and all of a sudden it opens up a whole new world to me that if I ask them more of a closed ended question, I'm sort of bringing my preconceived notions into the answer. And it becomes almost a rhetorical question where I'm guiding them towards a specific response, or at least I'm barricading them to some vertical that they have to, you know, they have to reside in. Whereas the open ended, I find that really, I'm getting a breadth of different world views and things that I really didn't expect. But Anique, I want to make sure that we have also enough time to talk about what you're doing now. Because I think that, yeah, go ahead. And I feel that I didn't answer your original question. Because I got too excited about the curiosity. To me, it's like in terms of great product management, I think it comes down to like, curiosity, leadership and execution. I think that you need all three of those things. If you have execution without leadership, then the teams aren't going to be happy. You're only going to execute once. But those are the three to me. And obviously, if you have curiosity, but you don't have the execution, then you're going to write some great confluence papers, but you're not going to end up building a product people love. But Anique, today you're working as VP of product in one of the startups that I enjoy most, mainly because I use it probably 50 or 60 times a day, with pretty much everything that I do, which is Loom. Loom has developed quite a bit since I began using it. And I've been really, really enjoying the product. So, when you talk to me about this customer delight and the feedbacks that also the user is getting and you're getting, I can really see that in the product that you're building there. So, as the VP of product, tell me a little bit about what Loom is, and what are some of your thoughts behind building now a product? I'm pretty sure, on a smaller scale now than with Uber and TripActions, right? But now you're seeing that fast growth as VP of Product. Yeah. So, Loom is a video messaging product that essentially allows you to instantly create a video message and get a link generated and share it to other people. And the reason why I joined is I had a tremendously difficult time giving design feedback to the team in Amsterdam when I worked at TripActions. I would sometimes sound like overly harsh over Slack. And with time zones, you'd have like two hours to work. And so, Loom enabled me just to create very quick, like, feedback loop. Yes. And like, the intent and the effectiveness and the efficiency of Loom was like just a magical experience. And I think, ultimately, and then if you ask yourself a few questions as to like, why is it so effective? Why is it so efficient? Right. Like the original form of communication was storytelling. Right? What are we doing right now? We're just telling stories back and forth. Loom is an incredible, like product to put that kind of storytelling, that human voice, that efficiency, that effectiveness, like in the forefront of how you work, especially in a distributed work setting. Which I think, like we all currently are in, and in the future we'll be in a totally different way. So, it's a little bit about Loom And a little bit about what your role as VP or Product. Is it exactly the same responsibilities you've had in TripActions, for example? What are some key differences between, you know, that a VP product might have in one company versus the other? Because obviously, the title is the same. But I imagine that the scope of responsibility is pretty different amongst different organizations. I think the responsibility between TripActions and Loom feels pretty similar. The major difference is design sets out. Like we have a design leader that runs the design organization. But I think, ultimately, the responsibility is, what are we doing, why are we doing it, is it the right thing. Right. Like, what we ultimately believe is our responsibility to our customers. Right? Like, what do our end users actually want? Are we making it better? Are we building a platform that will stand up? What is right? What is that? What are we doing? Why are we doing it? How does it connect to our vision? And then it's ultimately like, are we delivering it? And delivering it by like, when we said we were going to at the quality we said we were. And then how can you build an organization in a team that is constantly learning and constantly improving. So, we just get better and better at this dance. Right. And so, you joined Loom in August of 2020, pretty much at some peak of the pandemic. There were so many peaks that, you know, every day was almost the peak of something. And so, you joined Loom, remote collaboration, becoming, you know, diving deep into this relatively new industry that is very different from your previous industries. And so, what are some of your thoughts behind the remote collaboration, the things that you're observing within Loom that you've gotten to know over the past, I guess, four or five months or so? So, I do think there are some similarities between TripActions and Loom in the sense that they're both B2B2C. So, you're prior may be a company, but ultimately both products rely on your end user loving it. Right? And that's like kind of connected to Uber those roots. And so, being very connected to the consumers is really important. But I think, you know, when I joined Loom, I was really excited about the effectiveness and efficiency. Like, Loom can just help people connect, especially like global workforces. I think as I've you know, gotten to know the product and understand Joe and Vinay's fuller vision and experience the product myself, it's incredible how much the Loom product has the potential to really elevate the culture of a distributed workforce-- I completely agree. --in that cultural aspect, and what it can contribute. It makes your culture more effective and more efficient. But it also makes the culture more rich, more human, more lively. And I think until I started using Loom in the way that I do and starting to talk to customers that are using it in that manner, it's just an incredible, like the potential of Loom is just so huge. And I have to say, Anique, that I have to testify to this myself. I have quite a few people that I work with across the seas in various countries. A lot of them are dependent on my feedback on a daily basis, you know, every few hours. And then the difference between moving from a Slack feedback or a WhatsApp feedback, to now me recording a 15, 20 second snippet, of me demonstrating on the screen my feedback, with my bubble showing there, and me smiling and talking or even just being casual, it changes the whole relationship. It changes the dynamic. And I'm seeing it just to boost the productivity on all fronts. And I think and again, I love what you guys are doing. So, thank you for really making my work better and more collaborative. And for many of my friends and colleagues. I know that a lot of people that are using it. I don't want to take up much more of your time because I know that you're already running late to your next thing. But I really appreciate you taking the time to do this. My last question, which is my favorite one, is three words that you would use to describe yourself. I think maybe three would probably be greedy, loyal and adventurous. I love it. Anique, thank you very, very much. This was wonderful. And stay safe and stay healthy. So nice to meet you. Thank you so much for having me. Bye. Thank you.
