1
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,240
Wonderful.

2
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,720
So I think we can get started.

3
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,720
David Tennenhouse, it is such an honor

4
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,960
to have you on 20 Minute Leaders.

5
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,840
Thank you for your time.

6
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,720
Thank you, Michael.

7
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,600
Good to be here.

8
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,880
You know, I have your background

9
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,760
written down next to me

10
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,640
and I'm just overwhelmed

11
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,160
by attempting to start read it,

12
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,800
but I'll give a brief intro.

13
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,040
And I'd love to then dive

14
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,480
into your experiences.

15
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,600
So, Corporate Vice President

16
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,080
at incredible companies:

17
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,640
Intel, Amazon, Microsoft.

18
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,160
With a CEO of A9.com, subsidiary of Amazon.

19
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,080
DARPA's Chief Scientist.

20
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,320
Faculty member at MIT.

21
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,560
Partner at New Venture Partners.

22
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,080
VMware's Chief Research Officer.

23
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,280
LP at J-Ventures.

24
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,280
David, I only have 20 minutes.

25
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,800
I have to get as much knowledge

26
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,200
out of you as I can.

27
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,040
Did I get that right, first of all?

28
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,560
Was that okay?

29
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,560
You got that about right

30
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,320
Wonderful. Okay.

31
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,960
David, first of all, what does it mean

32
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,600
to be the chief research officer

33
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,760
of an incredible company like the VMware

34
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,360
which its foundation is based on research?

35
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,760
Well, the first thing is to be amazed that

36
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,520
people pay you to do this kind of thing.

37
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,480
I think, it is actually

38
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,040
just a phenomenal privilege.

39
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,840
You've got these really smart people

40
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,560
and a certain amount of it is just about

41
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,480
helping them find their way,

42
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,400
helping them connect

43
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,640
with business opportunities,

44
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,360
help them connect

45
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,880
with new research opportunities,

46
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,000
and really helping them get to the bottom

47
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,040
of how to maybe do more

48
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,920
with their great ideas.

49
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,520
Wow. Okay.

50
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,440
So, running chief research officer,

51
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,600
it sounds like it doesn't only entail

52
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,160
being the head scientist in the room

53
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,360
and choosing the path,

54
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,880
but it's also about culture.

55
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,600
It's about how do you drive innovation

56
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,280
and creativity within a group.

57
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,440
So, how do you drive innovation

58
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,360
and creativity in a world where VMware

59
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,880
is such a significant player

60
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,920
in distributed systems and the work that

61
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,160
I get to do on a day by day basis?

62
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,520
Well, the first thing to realize is,

63
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,400
people always talk about R&D.

64
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,480
I'm just the R, right?

65
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,480
But the D is the really big part of R&D.

66
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,040
So, a certain amount of this is still

67
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,520
about working with individuals

68
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,720
and as I said, helping them

69
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,000
take their great ideas.

70
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,840
So, it's really, I think you hit a stage

71
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,680
in your career where it's more, less

72
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,240
about driving your own ideas

73
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,120
and much more about

74
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,000
embracing other people's ideas

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,640
and really helping them drive them forward

76
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,080
and then sometimes standing back

77
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,440
and synthesizing them and say,

78
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,840
"Gee, you know, if we combine these ideas and

79
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,400
these ideas, maybe we can work on something bigger."

80
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,840
This is the challenge,

81
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,920
I think, in general,

82
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,280
in a research organization is that,

83
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,680
left to its own devices

84
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,240
you'll end up with many more

85
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,960
projects than you have people.

86
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,640
Wow. And how many researchers are there

87
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,840
at VMware as we're speaking now?

88
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,440
So, a certain amount there is

89
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,720
it depends how you count.

90
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,320
So, first off, you can't really say

91
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,640
researchers at VMware

92
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,600
'cause I'd say there are probably

93
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,080
many people in the company

94
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,840
that are actually conducting research

95
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,920
don't even know it.

96
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,000
Right.

97
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,760
But in terms of our corporate research,

98
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,040
it's actually a very small group.

99
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,640
So, think on the order of about

100
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,320
30 full time researchers.

101
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,320
We augment them.

102
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,600
We have postdocs.

103
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,440
We have interns.

104
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,240
So, when you said "right now" well

105
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,120
we have an enormous number of interns

106
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,320
working with both ...

107
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,160
... summertime.

108
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,760
We're in the peak of the intern season.

109
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,160
We have interns from all over the world.

110
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,840
This year, they're virtual -

111
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,440
I'm sure it's quite

112
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,560
an interesting experience

113
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,480
helping them, guiding them through this,

114
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,120
what is meant to be a very monumental

115
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,880
experience in their career.

116
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,560
Yup.

117
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,720
And then, and, so we augment.

118
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,880
The key is getting amplification.

119
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,520
So, we also actually have

120
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,680
a substantial number

121
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,160
of what we call affiliated ...

122
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,560
who are faculty members

123
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,000
that are working a day a week

124
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,640
roughly with VMware.

125
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,840
And some of these folks

126
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,200
have worked with us in the past.

127
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,400
So, for example, we have people

128
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,760
that came did a postdoc with us.

129
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,120
Now they're a faculty member.

130
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,840
They continue to work with us.

131
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,920
They send us interns.

132
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,080
So, we're not just working with them.

133
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,320
We're working with their team.

134
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,760
So, these are ways that you amplify

135
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,520
a research organization, right,

136
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,480
by adding in these these extra.

137
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,000
That's wonderful. My relationship

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,600
actually with VMware, it's funny.

139
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,080
Diane Green actually helped sponsor

140
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,240
a hackathon that I ran

141
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,000
when I was 18 in Silicon Valley

142
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,560
for young teens, 18 and under,

143
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,460
Hacking Generation Y.

144
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,440
One of my latest computer science professors

145
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,840
is Mendel Rosenblum, her husband.

146
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,280
So now we're speaking so I'm

147
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
getting to know more and more

148
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,320
of the VMware family,

149
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,280
which is wonderful.

150
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,840
But, David, I wanna take you back in time

151
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,760
and I want to now to have

152
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,840
a very selfish ask.

153
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,280
And I wanna talk about

154
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,720
young entrepreneurs like myself

155
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,920
and going through the incredible

156
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,320
experiences you've had from CEO of A9.com

157
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,680
to a partner at New Venture Partners,

158
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,720
to being a VP at three

159
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,520
magnificent corporations.

160
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,800
What major lessons can I take with me

161
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,040
as I'm just starting on my journey?

162
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:56,290
I'm just a baby here, right

163
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,160
24, I'm just now, I'm so curious.

164
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,040
What should I keep in mind as I go

165
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,640
through this journey and all of my friends

166
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,520
should keep in mind as well?

167
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,080
Well, I think there's a whole

168
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,720
bunch of things.

169
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,640
People will always say do the things

170
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,840
you're passionate about.

171
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,800
And they're right.

172
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,760
I mean, I think it's really

173
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,360
important to do that.

174
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,720
I think it's important, by the way to

175
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,000
about every five years,

176
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,640
stop and consider, right.

177
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,520
Is it time to make a change?

178
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,440
I think it's important to know yourself.

179
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,240
So there are people, by the way,

180
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,200
who are passionate about one topic

181
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,320
for decades.

182
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,840
They become the world's expert

183
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,000
in that topic

184
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,400
and they just keep going deeper

185
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,120
and their skill set is in that depth

186
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,080
and mastering that intricacy.

187
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,960
In fact, when I was in Intel we would have,

188
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,000
it was almost scary because

189
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,160
we had what we call the fellows

190
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,440
who were the experts

191
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,840
in any given technical area.

192
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,680
And what was scary was

193
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,000
you had this immense

194
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,680
many billion dollar company

195
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,880
with really the hero of lithography

196
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,880
The hero of how to design

197
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,080
the next transistor

198
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,560
The hero of how to take the things

199
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,120
from the lab into production.

200
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,320
But these people just

201
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,200
were really good at that.

202
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,560
So, that's knowing yourself

203
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,000
like maybe that's your thing.

204
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,080
For me, it's actually been

205
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,680
much more about hybridizing, right

206
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,360
So, in other words,

207
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,080
I love going into new areas.

208
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,720
Being a VC and you're getting

209
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,880
that experience now, right.

210
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,320
What's really neat is,

211
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,760
each company you go

212
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,600
it's likely that that company it's doing,

213
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,640
hopefully they're doing

214
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,000
something new and different, right?

215
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,880
So, you get to learn a new business.

216
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,360
Of course.

217
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:43,240
You've got to learn all about that

218
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,600
new vertical that they're in

219
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,040
and in fact, all the places they go

220
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,160
and that their customers are in.

221
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,880
So, I think knowing are you sort of one

222
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,000
of these people that's going to hybridize

223
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,480
across multiple places

224
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,360
and that's your strength,

225
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,320
I think of that as being

226
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,720
a portfolio person.

227
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,760
And I really came into that.

228
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,080
So, when I moved to DARPA,

229
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,400
I was then going from being sort of a

230
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,440
researcher at MIT with certain,

231
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,320
I won't say narrow,

232
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,760
because I was working across

233
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,320
what I thought

234
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,280
was a broad range of projects.

235
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,400
But now I have a big portfolio, right?

236
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,120
So, as a VC, it's more of a portfolio at,

237
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,200
or you can be the individual expert.

238
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,200
Both are great

239
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,760
but I think it's important to know

240
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,200
and there are a few people, not very many,

241
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,000
that can move between one and the other.

242
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,760
Right. Right so -

243
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,240
That's good, too,

244
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,440
but you need to know

245
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,920
which category you're in.

246
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,920
100%. And I think one of the interesting

247
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
challenges is that, at my age

248
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,000
when I'm just getting exposed to things.

249
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,760
My back story is that,

250
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,120
I grew up in a very tech savvy household.

251
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,960
My father has been in tech

252
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,080
for many many years.

253
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,960
And it took me a long time

254
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,360
to get into engineering.

255
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,600
And one of the things that he said

256
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,800
that really convinced me was,

257
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,480
"Michael, you can't assume your position

258
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,280
in the world before you experience

259
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,240
the different things.

260
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,680
So, go and learn engineering.

261
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,120
Go become good at artificial intelligence

262
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,640
and then decide what you wanna spend

263
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,960
the next 30 years on.

264
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,840
But you can't make a responsible decision

265
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,240
without actually trying

266
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,800
and giving yourself a fair shot"

267
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,680
But, David, I want to now take you back

268
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,520
and think what were some of the challenges

269
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,120
as a researcher early on in your career

270
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,680
that perhaps now are easier for you?

271
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,080
And if you were to go back to young David

272
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,320
and your various different positions,

273
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,280
what insights would you give yourself

274
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,400
to make the process a little bit easier

275
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,360
or more fulfilling?

276
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,520
Well, I think there's a couple

277
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,440
different things there.

278
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,080
I'd say is that I learned from one

279
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,360
of my mentors, George ...

280
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,120
a sort of list of standard questions

281
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,320
that he would ask, and unfortunately,

282
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,240
like I didn't learn this list.

283
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,640
So, you think, I started in Canada,

284
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,560
I did my graduate work in England.

285
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,480
Then I was at MIT.

286
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,080
Then only after that did I actually

287
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,040
pick up on this list.

288
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,600
It would have been good to know, and to start with

289
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,760
what are you trying to do?

290
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,480
So, again, it's a little different

291
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,120
from science

292
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,600
because scientists are trying to

293
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,160
ask a question almost of nature.

294
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,480
Engineers, we're trying to change the world.

295
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,160
We are trying to change something.

296
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,520
So, what are you trying to do?

297
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,320
Say it in really simple words.

298
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,400
Get it down to,

299
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,640
Google, they try to say it in five words.

300
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,600
But the important thing George said was,

301
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,680
be able to say it without a bunch of jargon.

302
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,560
And then he had this kind of neat question

303
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:41,120
which is, how do people do it today?

304
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,440
Now, that was kind of interesting because

305
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,760
here you think you're trying to do

306
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,600
anything new that nobody's done before

307
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,360
and you're gonna have this

308
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,480
whole new capability

309
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,240
and what he's saying is,

310
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,560
"Look, if this is really important,

311
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,440
people have worked out some way to do it.

312
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,640
They may be doing it manually.

313
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,600
They may be doing it through a crazy way.

314
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,800
But there's somebody out there

315
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,560
that has figured out some way to do it

316
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,720
and you need to understand

317
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,840
what that is"

318
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,360
So, you're replacing and displacing someone.

319
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,960
So, that's really kind of interesting.

320
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,200
Then, what's your new idea?

321
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,000
Really, how's your new approach?

322
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,760
How's it different?

323
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,480
And what are the three hard problems?

324
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,920
What are the, what I now call

325
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,520
when I talk to junior researchers,

326
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,760
what are the three rocks you need to move

327
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,840
in order to make this real?

328
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,320
And by the way, don't even try to move

329
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,200
all three of those

330
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,880
because maybe, this is again a lesson,

331
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:37,080
maybe if you move one of those rocks,

332
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,120
somebody else or something else will

333
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,360
move one or two of them in parallel.

334
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,600
So, but at least know what they are

335
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,080
because you don't wanna get to the end

336
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,360
and find that you got stuck

337
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,600
because it's something

338
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,920
that you should have anticipated.

339
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,920
So, now having learned about you're,

340
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,200
I've heard your story about your great

341
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,120
brilliant new idea and your new approach.

342
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,960
So, nobody's really followed

343
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,240
this approach before, you think.

344
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,200
And then his question was

345
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,680
why didn't it work last time?

346
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,760
Now, unfortunately,

347
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,560
the way he asked this question

348
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,040
tended to be very discouraging

349
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,760
but I've learned to try to be softer

350
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,080
in asking it.

351
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,440
Because what he's really saying is,

352
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,600
"Look, it's probably the case that somebody

353
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,280
tried something like this before."

354
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,080
You can get kind of get discouraged and say,

355
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,560
"Gee, damn, I thought this was

356
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,400
a whole new idea.

357
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,560
I only wanna work on whole new ideas.

358
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,200
I'm gonna have to go find something else."

359
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,040
What he was really saying was,

360
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,320
somebody has probably worked

361
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,000
on a variation of this.

362
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,920
Find it and understand why

363
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,280
it didn't work before.

364
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,760
And what I say to researchers is,

365
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,400
I trust your intuition.

366
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,640
In other words,

367
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,280
I believe that you are right,

368
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,760
that now is the right time to go try this.

369
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,200
Even if other people tried it

370
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,400
five years ago.

371
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,240
And others tried it 10 years ago.

372
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,160
And others tried it 15 years ago.

373
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,680
But what we need to figure out is

374
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,400
why your intuition is right

375
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,160
because probably what you're saying is

376
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,400
either the problem has changed,

377
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,240
and actually we're gonna apply

378
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,600
that idea from before

379
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,840
to a different problem

380
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,760
or somebody moved

381
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,720
one of those other rocks, right?

382
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
While we weren't looking.

383
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,550
Some other invention

384
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,480
has made this more feasible today.

385
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
Or something's changed

386
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,520
in the business climate

387
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,310
or in the business ecosystem.

388
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,640
But knowing why your intuition

389
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
is likely to be right

390
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,720
and that's something that

391
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,440
I wasn't as good at.

392
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,520
I think that I've always been

393
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,160
an intuitively driven researcher.

394
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,040
And it's important to know that,

395
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,960
first off 'cause it can guide your work

396
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,800
but second off, because it helps you

397
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,160
explain it to other people.

398
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,280
David, I think what I'm inspired

399
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,960
about here is this open mindedness

400
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,270
and curiosity that drives research that,

401
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,960
this whole time we haven't even mentioned

402
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,440
a single industry or a single problem

403
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,240
that you enjoy solving.

404
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,400
We're talking about the core of research

405
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,200
and finding opportunities and re-examining,

406
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,120
re-evaluating previous opportunities

407
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,480
that perhaps had those

408
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,070
big rocks stationed there.

409
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,640
And now, two years later,

410
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,790
something has changed.

411
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,440
Somebody moved a certain needle

412
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,120
that all of a sudden paved the way

413
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,120
and your role as a leader of a research team

414
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,560
is to be able to embrace that.

415
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,440
Trust your people's intuition

416
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,040
and help motivate them

417
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,920
to look for these new opportunities

418
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,110
that might not have been there before.

419
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,080
And by the way, when they go try

420
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,760
that new idea, that idea

421
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,320
that maybe people tried before

422
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,680
in these new circumstances,

423
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,110
by the time they're done,

424
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,920
it will be a new idea.

425
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,920
In other words, it will have morphed

426
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:44,640
and changed and they'll have added new insights.

427
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,880
So, it's not just a matter of

428
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,080
"The rest of our lives are just

429
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,240
re-creating ideas that some ancestors have"

430
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,160
It's this notion that as you go through it,

431
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,520
you're actually changing and gaining

432
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,880
more insight along the way.

433
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,030
And it's when you look back that you say,

434
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,830
"Oh, this is what was really important."

435
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,800
Anyway, you keep going

436
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,110
with your questions 'cause -

437
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,280
I have one that you probably

438
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,270
don't get that often,

439
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,030
but I'm still very curious.

440
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,640
Are there any regrets that you have

441
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,320
on things that you didn't do

442
00:19:21,322 --> 00:19:22,160
in your career?

443
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,560
Because with such an impressive career,

444
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,080
I think it's very easy to go and say

445
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,240
he's done it all and he's completely

446
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,480
satisfied and fulfilled at doing everything

447
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,000
you wanted to do.

448
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,160
But are there certain positions

449
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,800
that you wish, that looking back

450
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,400
you might have wanted to take a stab at

451
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,400
or different entrepreneurial endeavors

452
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,320
you might have wanted to do?

453
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,960
No, I don't think in terms of,

454
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,040
this is a mindset

455
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,350
So I don't have regrets, right.

456
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,070
In that sense.

457
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,240
Would it have been nice to have had

458
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:57,160
a unicorn when I was a VC?

459
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,040
Sure. Of course.

460
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,270
That would have been great, right

461
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,920
I'm asking this because my generation

462
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,960
is all about FOMO.

463
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,120
And it's all about fear of missing out

464
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,200
on different opportunities

465
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,960
and grappling with the different things

466
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,070
that the world has.

467
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,720
And one of the things

468
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,000
that I wanna take with me is,

469
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,280
how do I go about my opportunities

470
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,120
not constantly thinking about

471
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,030
what else is out there for me.

472
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,440
I wanna be in the moment,

473
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,400
love what I do and concentrate on that.

474
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,720
Yeah. It's interesting.

475
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,510
This is a discussion I often have with people.

476
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,480
So, for example,

477
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,720
let's say I'm speaking to

478
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,270
a research candidate

479
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
and they've got offers from a university

480
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,640
and they've got offers from us

481
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,320
and they've got offers from another company.

482
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:38,920
I'm sort of like,

483
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,200
Hey, this is wonderful, right?

484
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,280
This is one of ... problems to have

485
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,720
is when you have these other opportunities.

486
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:53,920
So, I do get the sort of,

487
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,120
I can understand how people can

488
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,920
have the fear of missing out

489
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,240
and what I'd urge them to do

490
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,760
is just look at this as

491
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,720
what a great high class problem to have.

492
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,750
That you have all these different options.

493
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,510
Now, go get started on one.

494
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,480
Right.

495
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,440
When I was a researcher at MIT,

496
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,520
I remember being in a point where there

497
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,000
I was sort of spinning my wheels.

498
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,000
Because there were three different

499
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,520
major research initiatives

500
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,590
that I wanted to launch

501
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
and I loved all of them

502
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,640
And what I eventually had to do,

503
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,240
and I got some advice on this,

504
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,960
was just start one.

505
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,200
And in fact, the advice was,

506
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,590
"David, you have to let one of these things

507
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,440
trick you into falling in love with it"

508
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,270
I love that.

509
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,160
Let yourself get sucked into one of these

510
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,240
so that you throw your energy into it.

511
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,200
And I did that

512
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,960
And because I was just sort of almost

513
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,960
holding myself at a distance

514
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,880
from all three opportunities,

515
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,440
not diving in and committing to any one.

516
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,120
What was interesting was,

517
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,440
you know what?

518
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,880
A year later, we had that first

519
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,280
project up and running.

520
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,000
And an opportunity came by

521
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,600
to submit some proposals.

522
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,240
Yeah, you know we got the second one going.

523
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,720
Right.

524
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,920
And a couple of years later,

525
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,120
we got the third one going.

526
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,520
And so, when I looked a few years later,

527
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,550
I started them sequentially

528
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,360
but in fact, we actually had

529
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,200
I say we,

530
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,120
so it's myself, my graduate students,

531
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,240
people work ... me it was a a team.

532
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,520
So, it didn't matter which order.

533
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,440
It mattered to just let myself

534
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,880
get drawn into one of these enough.

535
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,880
Fall in love with them.

536
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,000
And not feel like you,

537
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,760
and this is again

538
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,920
a discussion I often have with researchers.

539
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,640
I'd say, "I'm not asking you

540
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:51,560
to let go of that other aspiration" right.

541
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,110
Keep it and love it.

542
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,550
Let's just get going with this one first

543
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,640
and then we're gonna get going

544
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,680
with the other one later.

545
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,040
I love that mindset.

546
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,320
I love that mindset of leadership.

547
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,280
And I love that mindset of fall in love

548
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,000
with what you do.

549
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,640
And it's not that you're foregoing

550
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,550
different opportunities.

551
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,120
You're choosing which ones to do now

552
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,840
and which ones to pursue later.

553
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,760
And you don't know what later

554
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,960
holds for you as well.

555
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,830
David, 20 minutes go by way too fast.

556
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,560
And I have to end with

557
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,790
my favorite question.

558
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,160
Three words that best describe you.

559
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,310
I guess one is a focus on impact.

560
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
Okay. Focus on impact.

561
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,960
Wanting to change the world.

562
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,680
This is in a good way.

563
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,000
A positive impact.

564
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,360
I know that's an extra word hyphenated.

565
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,920
I think this sense of being

566
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,680
a hybridizer or a tech polyglot -

567
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,960
I love that.

568
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,920
across different domains.

569
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,440
And then the other is is intuitive.

570
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,160
And I'm gonna confess that I'm not

571
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,520
as data driven as some people.

572
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,760
In other words, it's funny because

573
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,680
I champion data driven research.

574
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,520
I'm constantly trying to make our company

575
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,590
a more data driven company,

576
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,360
but I will say that in a lot of things

577
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,200
in research, I think it does

578
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,400
come down to intuition.

579
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,280
I love that so much.

580
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,600
David, thank you for the inspiration.

581
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,160
Thank you for the time to do this.

582
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,840
You have so much responsibility

583
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,880
and so many people that need you

584
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,840
and need your time.

585
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,000
So, I really thank you for being

586
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,920
so generous with me.

587
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,070
And good luck with everything.

588
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,160
And stay safe and stay healthy.

589
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,760
Thank you. Great being with you.

590
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,000
You stay healthy, too.

591
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,110
And just keep going with J-Ventures.

592
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,440
Thank you very much. Take care, David.

593
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,320
Bye bye. Bye bye.
