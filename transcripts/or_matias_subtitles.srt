1
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:11,466
Or Matias, thank you for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

2
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:14,432
It's actually Matias, and thank you for having me.

3
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:21,632
That's debatable. Okay. So, I have the privilege of speaking to my brother now for 20 minutes.

4
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:26,932 
One of the most incredibly talented musicians that I have ever met and will ever meet in my life.

5
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:36,532
A musical director of Broadway, Juilliard, NYU, for Musical Theatre. Now you are lecturing at a university

6
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:39,432
What are you doing? Give me a little bit of a rundown.

7
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:45,099
These days I'm staying home and washing my hands as I hope all of your viewers are.

8
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:52,999
But yeah, it's been quite a ride. I mean, like you mentioned I've kinda run the gamut from being in classical music

9
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,099
for many years to then. Working with rock bands and pop bands.

10
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,999
And I'm kinda finding myself at the heart of this musical theatre scene in New York.

11
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,366
And now have the privilege of teaching at Manhattan School of Music which has been so rewarding.

12
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:12,932
And it's been kind of a wild trajectory figuring out how to navigate all of these musical interests that I have

13
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:18,332
And kind of keeping things fresh and really trying to trust my instincts

14
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:23,866
And in terms of you know letting the road kind of take me between these various paths

15
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:29,599
and figuring out how to just learn the most from the musical legends around me I think.

16
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,232
Definitely. So, I mean coming from what you called the entrepreneurship world.

17
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:39,432
The paths for a computer scientist or an entrepreneur are somewhat clear you know.

18
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:43,232
You're getting to a good university. You're in Israel you go to a good unit

19
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:48,066
You start programming at an early age and then you work as a software engineer and so on and so on.

20
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:53,199
How does it work in music? So, what do you have to do to get to the level of being in Broadway?

21
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,732
as musician. Now as composer. And being one of the top pianists in the world.

22
00:08:56,733 --> 00:09:04,199
Yeah. That's really a kind of a million-dollar question. I think it's like the first question that I get asked

23
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,899
by these incredibly talented young people who make their way to the city and get started

24
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:19,066
and want to know what the path is like and I think the truth is you know, there's this known

25
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:23,199
kind of phrase or adet which is you have to be at the right place at the right time.

26
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,766
But I think a lot of it is just like being in as many places during as many times as possible.

27
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:36,066
And I think that for me it was really making sure that I wasn't pitch and holing myself

28
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:43,866
to one very very specific either style or form of performance of kind of idea

29
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:46,899
of what I wanted to purse in front of me.

30
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:53,999
It was really just figuring out how to really finesse the thing that sounded interesting to me.

31
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,766
And I can be a little bit more specific. No. I grow up writing songs and being inspired by a lot of Israeli song writers

32
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,899
and American song writers and thinking that I wanted to be a song writer.

33
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:10,066
And So I spent my formative teenage years writing as many songs as I possibly could.

34
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,066
And still listen to them, yeah.

35
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:18,099
And learning from the great great song writers who I was inspired by their work.

36
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:25,466
And so I did that for many years. And then weirdly you know, when I was 16, when I was living in Palo Alto

37
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:33,799
I kind of found myself really immersed with the dream of pursuing classical music to the highest level.

38
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,366
So then I started practicing for hours a day and really taking that seriously.

39
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:42,266
And found myself a Juilliard. And you know did that--

40
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:47,266
Wait, back back. What does it mean for hours a day? Paint me a picture.

41
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:50,332
Because you know most people don't get to experience what I've experienced growing up.

42
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:55,632
Having a brother that's all there next to the piano that's doing scales on top of scales on top of scales.

43
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:57,832
Give me a run down. What is it like?

44
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:02,532
Yeah. So that's a great question. And it's something that I have to admit even for myself.

45
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:09,232
I came to it a little bit later than a lot of my Juilliard peers who had kind of been doing it since they were kids.

46
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:15,299
But for me you know, like a daily routine like you're saying what often consist of starting the day with an hour of scales

47
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:22,299
or technical exercises. And that's something that for me was really kind of the gateway into the practice day.

48
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:28,899
Warming up the hands and stretching the boundaries of what was possible physically at the instrument.

49
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:33,299
Working on things like dexterity. Working on things like precision.

50
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,399
And making sure that all the fingers were even in terms of the way they were approaching the piano.

51
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,199
So that's like you know, that's a very kind of methodical, technical form of practice.

52
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,199
And then you can really in terms of how those hours are spent, it's kind of amazing.

53
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,999
Because when you look at the idea of working on a piece of music,

54
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,732
you know there's a technical element of being able to perform it.

55
00:11:56,733 --> 00:12:02,432
So if you think of even pieces that you know people have heard of like Rachmaninoff Concertos

56
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:08,866
So there's an element of being able to play the note which in of itself is an enormous task.

57
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:15,466
And it takes hundreds of hours in order to finesse but then there's also the element of the musical work.

58
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:18,366
Which is the question of exactly how you're executing each phrase.

59
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:21,799
And the emotions that you're putting into it.

60
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:30,066
Exactly. And that is endless. And it's all about the relationship between how much control you have in a technical level.

61
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:35,366
In order to be execute the ideas that you have on a musical level.

62
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:38,566
And so that's the relationship that you work on during the practice session.

63
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:43,066
But you actually you know, when you look at sports and you look at let's say soccer,

64
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:46,799
you have some of the inevitable injuries that people have throughout their career.

65
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,832
You have some similar injuries but from a musical perspective, right?

66
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:55,099
Yeah. I mean remember the hands and your back and everything.

67
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:03,466
Yeah, it was so the kind of the crazy twist to the kind of art that my story took is that

68
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:09,466
after all these years of really practicing and getting into Juilliard and feeling so excited.

69
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:14,432
I found myself there enjoying my freshman year, I was so eager to prove myself.

70
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:19,866
That I was practicing tenfolds and sometimes spending 12 hours a day in the practice room

71
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:25,632
And few months into my very first year, I started feeling these tingles around my right arm

72
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:29,432
And it kind of went from zero to 60 in a matter of days.

73
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:34,899
And I found myself with crippling tendonitis, and I actually had to stop playing the piano

74
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:40,899
for about six months. I went back. I was seeing this Physiotherapist

75
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:47,366
so it allows me to practice for five minutes a day. And so, there was this crazy moment

76
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:53,699
where I was in this epicenter of the greatest musical institution in the world

77
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,232
and everybody around me kind of leaping and strides and

78
00:13:57,233 --> 00:14:01,699
I was able to touch the piano for five minutes a day so that was very very challenging.

79
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,166
To say it was the least period in my life.

80
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:08,366
Unbelievable. For the thousands of people who wished they could be in Juilliard

81
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:12,199
but because of their activity they don't have the opportunity to be there

82
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,699
Give me two sentences of what those four years were like. Both the good and the bad.

83
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:25,399
You open up a lard can of worms, my komatias.

84
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:31,866
So, the good is certainly the fact that you know I was at this institution that gave me musical tools

85
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:37,199
that I know for a certain that I would not have acquired anywhere else in the world.

86
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,532
I mean it's unbelievable on the amount of knowledge and technique and understanding and depth

87
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:47,932
It's something I'm drawn every day, right now, when I write for theater,

88
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:54,799
When I compose for various mediums. It's just this like amazing tool box of knowledge that I acquired

89
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,532
Do you know that the more challenging side of the school is the technical element

90
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:05,432
Because part of what the school does is that it preps you in such a profound way

91
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:10,166
to be able to tackle anything under any circumstance, with any level of duress

92
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:15,266
which means that the expectations are incredibly high and the demands are high

93
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:23,132
And sometimes it's possible to a little bit lose sight of the heart behind the things

94
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:28,932
that you're working on because the speed is so robust

95
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:34,299
And so I will say for me, as somebody who came to school already feeling like

96
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,466
I was struggling to keep up with the technical elements

97
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:42,332
It was hard for me to navigate the demands and the passion for the elements itself.

98
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:50,032
And I'm sure that with all of that you also have this huge competitive nature in any selective place

99
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,799
where you're competing at the end over slots.

100
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,332
And you know the Broadway industry, notorious for being what it is.

101
00:15:56,333 --> 00:16:02,466
And then you have this incredible transition to doing your masters at NYU

102
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:05,366
And you're transitioning more to the musical theater world

103
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:08,366
which is radically different from classical music. Right?

104
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,166
How did that even happen?

105
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:21,699
There's a story that I tell and it sounds hyper dramatize but I swear it's true.

106
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:29,599
And we can have an alibi to the story. But the story goes that during my senior year at Juilliard

107
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:37,299
I had this incredible Theory teacher named Thomas Cabaniss who I really really admire and appreciated

108
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,666
And I was writing all these songs and one day you know, what I would do is sometimes

109
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:48,366
before classes or after classes, I would linger in the teacher studios to just play my songs

110
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:53,699
Because the teacher studios has the best pianos. And so, I was kind of hanging out

111
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,332
in Tom's classroom playing the song of mine. And after the song is over,

112
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:02,766
he comes from behind the door, and he's like, "Did you write that song?"

113
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:06,499
And I was like, "Yeah, yeah. I write a bunch of songs. That's one of them."

114
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:14,566
And he hands me a piece of paper and says something like, "Show up at this address tomorrow."

115
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:17,899
Which can be creepy but it was also quite profound.

116
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:25,766
Because the address that I ended up finding myself up was this incredible human named Mel Marvin.

117
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:28,466
who to this day has become one of my greatest mentors.

118
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:32,732
And Mel Marvin, in addition to being an unbelievable Broadway composer

119
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:35,932
and brought to music for the [--] Broadway,

120
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:43,066
And also is one of the head composers of this musical theatre writing program at NYU.

121
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:47,332
And so we were at his house and he asked me to play him a bunch of my songs

122
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:52,032
And I did. And he just turned to me and said, "Have you ever thought about writing for theater?"

123
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:58,866
And I genuinely admittedly haven’t. I mean you know, we grow up in a household in Israel

124
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:03,599
which is very cultured but musical theatre wasn't heavenly on my radar

125
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,199
And I said to him, "You know what? Thank you but that's not really what I do."

126
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,599
And he said to me, "Okay. Well, have you heard of this composer? And this composer?"

127
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,266
And he started playing me all of this amazing musical theatre songs.

128
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:23,466
Like Sondheim, and Adam Guettel, and Michael John LaChiusa. All these people

129
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:26,366
And he said, "This is the music that's being read and you should check it out."

130
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:31,066
And he encouraged me to apply to this program at NYU.

131
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:35,899
And at the time I was kind of toying with the idea of maybe going to LA

132
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,932
to do some film scoring after Juilliard etcetera, but I said to myself "Why not, I'll apply."

133
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:48,032
And he very generously offered me this full scholarship. This deans fellowship to go to NYU.

134
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:53,432
And get my master’s degree in musical theater. And I said, "You know, this sounds a great opportunity."

135
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:58,799
And while I was there, I met all of these incredible people and started music directing.

136
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,566
And it kinda happen serendipitously and naturally.

137
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:05,332
Unbelievable

138
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:09,866
I mean, you've been quite in few productions on both on and off Broadway.

139
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:16,032
You know I remember much younger, I watched you as you played piano at the "Rent".

140
00:19:16,033 --> 00:19:19,932
And you're, I remember you're practicing for hours for the last five years

141
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:24,066
Which made me fall in love with that show. And in general, I mean

142
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:28,266
I owe it to you my love for musical theater now. And you know how much I love musical theater.

143
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:32,399
Arguably more than you do. This quite ironic I have to say.

144
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,132
Given that I cannot sing and I cannot play.

145
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:41,966
And I cannot dance of course. And then you went on to be a huge huge huge part

146
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:45,266
of the hugest successful show "The Great Comet".

147
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,132
And you've really seen it through it all. Right?

148
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:53,066
You really felt what it's like to bring a show from ideation to Broadway.

149
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:57,932
Talk to me about this really unique experience that even most people don't get to experience.

150
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:03,266
Yeah, kind of wild. Kind of wild.

151
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:07,199
So the story of my relationship with that show is kind of insane

152
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,899
Because, like you said, I had been kind of doing all of this, like playing piano in pits, in subbing

153
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,899
and Rent, and for the last five years, I'm really trying to make my name as a Music Director

154
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,899
And I had music directed a Reading.

155
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,599
And in theater speak, a Reading is basically a week long workshop.

156
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:33,566
It's 29 hours which you basically just workshop a piece to get it to a very very basic form of presentation.

157
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:39,199
And I had done this workshop for an amazing, amazing theater company called "Ars Nova"

158
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,799
which to this day has become kind of an artistic home to me

159
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,999
and I loved it and expressed to their artistic director Jason Eagan

160
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,399
that I wanted to be able to do more with them

161
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,166
and he said to me, "You know what? There's this guy who we just commissioned a piece from

162
00:20:57,167 --> 00:21:00,332
and you should meet him. I think you two will hit it off because you both have

163
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:06,566
your passion about class, on jazz, on rock, and come from all this background and his name is Dave Malloy."

164
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:10,366
And so, he put me in touched with Dave. And I remembered I travelled to Brooklyn

165
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:14,566
And we ended up sitting in this coffee shop and talking about everything.

166
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:21,566
From Bach to Tom Waits, to any kind of music that you can imagine.

167
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:30,166
And Dave had just started putting together the final version of Great Comet for its original production.

168
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:38,999
And weirdly, he first invited me to come audition for one of the characters.

169
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,266
The Balaga, right?

170
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:43,732
The Balaga, who was at the time also an associate.

171
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:46,432
Music Director Dave was also the music director.

172
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:51,366
It wasn't enough that he was the writer, book writer, lyricist, composer, and orchestrator.

173
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:53,466
He was also the music director of the original production.

174
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:58,566
And you know, a lot of things were happening with my life at the time,

175
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:04,166
I mean, it just so happened that I got offer to go to Australia and New Zealand for a tour with this violinist.

176
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:10,499
And so, I very sadly kinda had to withdraw myself from the pool of that production.

177
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,432
But I was following and saw it. And it was absolutely incredible.

178
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:20,466
And I was so honored when the show got picked up by a commercial producer

179
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:26,099
and then taken on to have a commercial life, Dave called me and said, "Listen."

180
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:33,132
Oh I should also say. I've also forgot that Dave also played the lead role of "Pierre" in the production.

181
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:34,899
Right. That's correct. Yup.

182
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,632
And Dave said to me, "Listen, I think I'm doing one thing too many.

183
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:41,266
I'm looking for a music director Will you do it?"

184
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:44,599
And so I came. And I'm interviewed again with the team.

185
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,132
And I became the official music director of the show in its first commercial off-Broadway phase

186
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:55,432
which was done on 14th street, right underneath the high line.

187
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:58,099
And there was this magical magical time which I remember you came to see it

188
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,332
I think to receive a photo of you young in costume

189
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:06,732
Yeah, yeah. You dressed me up. I was sitting next to you. I was feeling the power.

190
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:08,732
And you know, we fast forward and you're all of a sudden

191
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:11,499
you're in the heart of Times Square on Broadway

192
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,432
With over a thousand people in the audience in this very interactive,

193
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:20,066
engaging production with Josh Groban as the lead actor.

194
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:25,899
And every time I still see the Good Morning America snippets of where you guys are performing.

195
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,432
It just puts a smile on my face. And all my friends who loves musical theater.

196
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:33,432
They just can't stop raving about the Great Comet and the work that you did there.

197
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:36,966
It was just so incredible. But you're not just a musical director.

198
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:42,599
Because you also were nominated for an award for being an actor acting as Rachmaninoff.

199
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,332
So funny that you're mentioning him for ad list

200
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:50,599
because you're actually playing Rachmaninoff at the Lincoln Center, right?

201
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,866
Yeah. So, Dave who wrote Great Comet wrote this incredible piece called "Preludes"

202
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:59,566
which was about specifically about appearing Rachmaninoff's life when he suffered from writer's block.

203
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:04,166
And I had the distinct privilege of playing. In the show there were two of us playing Rachmaninoff.

204
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:07,566
I played the pianist version of him.

205
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:14,066
And my wonderful friend Gabriel Ebert played the kind of composer troubled from host writers block.

206
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:20,266
And yeah, I had the honor of being nominated for Lucille Lortel award for that performance.

207
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:25,466
And that piece really had my heart. I love working on that so very much.

208
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:28,599
Incredible. But your true passion after all of this and with all of this,

209
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:34,966
So you've already accomplished more than the top 99.9% percentile of musicians could accomplished

210
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:40,999
Yeah, your heart lies at composition and artistically exploring your inner life

211
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,066
And the music that you're creating is very different.

212
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:50,299
It has a lot of right jazz to it. It has a lot of different musical styling to it.

213
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,999
Tell me a little bit about what is composing to you?

214
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,999
Yeah. So, like I mentioned, this all began with me as a kid wanting to write songs

215
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,699
I mean I think you know, one of the big big big sounds that was in our house growing up

216
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:09,532
and we contributed it to, I think mostly to our father who has CDs of Johnny Richter

217
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:12,666
And wonderful Israeli song writer Matti Caspi.

218
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:18,299
And those we're these two titans playing in our house. And I remember hearing their music

219
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,032
which is infused with, and you know for Matti Caspi is like Brazilian rhythms

220
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:28,999
and for Johnny Richter, it's American jazz. And its these amazing harmonies with soulful melodies

221
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,266
And that's exactly the kind of stuff that I love doing so much.

222
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:39,066
And I wanted to pursue my whole life doing. And now I'm finally, you know I'm 32,

223
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:47,999
And finally taking the time to say, "All right, I've done all that incredible work facilitating other people’s writing.

224
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,666
And now it's time to go back and invest in my own."

225
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:55,166
And so I wrote this musical called the "The Wave".

226
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:58,599
Which is based on this really kind of heroine experiment.

227
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,899
In which a teacher turned the whole high school into this facetious movement in the 60's.

228
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,366
And I've been developing it for a few years with my fiancée Chloe Treat.

229
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:11,199
Who I know that you also interviewed.

230
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,866
And we finally, finally this year are getting the world premiere production of it in Austria.

231
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:23,167
You know, knock on wood. God willing.

232
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,199
Well, the world tour?

233
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,032
So the world premiere of this musical in Linz Austria, God willing you know.

234
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:44,866
Let's just hope the worlds starts healing as quickly as possible.

235
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:49,666
That is just incredible. So, we're almost at 20 minutes.

236
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:54,632
But if I have to ask you the most important question, I need three words that best describe you.

237
00:26:54,633 --> 00:27:02,632
Or as somebody that you worked with would describe you as.

238
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:11,899
Okay. Passionate.

239
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,099
I'd say, hardworking or diligent.

240
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,899
And earnest.

241
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,332
Earnest. Okay, explain that first.

242
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:29,599
I feel like I really believe in putting my heart out. Just being a true self.

243
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,432
I try to, especially in my work, to not put a facade.

244
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:38,266
When I write music, I try to let it be kind of the most honest and earnest side of me.

245
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:43,266
And sometimes just to allow myself to be vulnerable. Even if not everybody responds to it.

246
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:47,099
But to present myself in kind of the purest forms possible.

247
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,299
I love it. Or, akhi, todah rabah. That was amazing.

248
00:27:52,300 --> 00:29:15,067
Thank you brother Michael. This was so fun. Take Care. Bye
