1 Menstrual hygiene is a very, very taboo job in our area. I mean, you cannot talk to the men about the menstrual periods or any kind of issue. Maya Vishwakarma, thank you so much for joining me on my show. How are you? I'm really great. I'm doing good. It's beautiful here in California. So, yeah. It's nice, yeah. Thank you so much for joining me all the way from California. But really, what we'll talk about is not California. We're going to talk about India today, right. Because you're doing some fascinating work with India and helping a lot of people, both locally and at scale. So, I want to just dive straight into it. Maya, tell me a little bit about your journey and how do you get to work in rural Indian, helping a lot of women? Yes. So, Michael, I am born and brought up in India. It's a very small village called Mehragaon, and it's like you can't even find in the Google map. And that's where I grew up. And I came all the way from there to the United States. And then I study science. And then I was doing my PhD program in South Dakota. After two years, I dropped it and I joined the research here. And one thing I realized, like how many people comes from that far to here and pursue the study and have a good life. And the things I've seen in my village, back in my village and problems are arising. So, I thought, like, let's give some try and, you know, just serve those people. So, I went back to my village, search of all the problems, I knew also because I grew up there. So, then I find out, like, okay, these are the bigger issues which I can, you know, work easily because nothing is like, difficult for me since I know the people, language and culture and everything. So, then I started with this project called menstrual hygiene awareness affordability and availability. These three things like, it has to be there because in the remote area everywhere, this is the women hygiene, women hygiene is a big issue everywhere, most of the part. So, tell me a little bit about this big issue. What is the issue and what is the scale of it as well? Because, you know, coming from a place that's a little far away, it's a little distant from my understanding. So, share with me a little bit about what's actually happening. Yes. So, the thing is, like earlier time, like, if you talk about like our grandmas time, that time, they were like, you know, very, very accu with the cotton clothes. We all know, like, you know, all the time, the women they used to have the good cotton in the abundance that they can change that cloth every time they can dry. And they had that kind of a freedom. But over the time we replaced that cotton with the synthetic, with the other materials and then families getting divided and then the women space got very, very small. And now, the new modern India so-called like the architecture of the houses, the buildings that are build, you can't dry that clothes in a sun. And it is a big taboo in India. So, if you can't dry and you can't wash that clothes, then ultimately, it will be making you sick. And nowadays it's very, very hard because one woman is using the same clothes over and over and over and over. And especially in the rainy season, it gets really moisture and that's how they got UTI, URTI, cervical cancer and so many of those stuff. So, this is the major issue. And because of the biggest population in India, like we are billions in India, so, it's a hard to reach out the sanitary pad to each and everyone in the remote, in the tribal area. So, most of the women who are living in the outside, like outskirt countryside, they don't even know what is sanitary pad. And if they know the sanitary pad, it is so expensive that they can't even afford it. Because it comes with a, it doesn't come with the livelihood because they had to arrange first the food, and then only they can think about other stuff. So, most of the population can't afford such expensive pads. And if they can afford then it's not available there. So, then we started thinking about it and then we thought, like, you know how to solve this problem in our area, actually. So, tell me a little bit about this problem solving thinking. First of all, how would you define the scale of this problem? So, how many people do you think are lacking this proper hygiene or sanitation right now, because of these different norms in modern India? How big is this problem that you're tackling? So, the problem is really, really huge. The data says like still in the modern age in India, all the rural place, 70% population is still not getting the hygienic stuff. Wow. 70% in the village in the rural India, they are not getting the sanitary pad or any hygienic stuff. So, the problem is very, very big, very, very high. And I tell you, like 12% girls, they drop out because of this issue. Because in the school, when they get to periods, they don't have pads. They use the clothes and then they go to school and the school doesn't have toilets, and, you know, comfort kind of place where they can change. So, they don't go to school. And then finally, they drop out. So, 12% girls they drop out from the school because of the sanitary pad. Unbelievable. And so, tell me a little bit about your experience. How do you even get involved with thinking about a problem like this and knowing that this is something that you're passionate about solving? Yeah, because this relate to my own story. When I was growing up in those areas, I was also one of them in my teens,. So, in my high school. I also feel the similar issues, like using the clothes, and very hard time for drying them. And if they dry it's hard to keep them like six hours or so. So, all these difficulties, I went through. And then, you know, over the time, I also got some kind of infections and all issues like the other women's. And then because I was always a ward in a hospital in the medical research. So, I thought, I may can solve these issues because this relate to me. This is my very, very intimate, you know, issue that I can understand other girls, other women. So, then I went there and then I talked to the women's and heard their issues, their problems. And then we thought, like, okay, how can we go one by one, one step at the time. Then we find out, like, you know, who is the guy, I mean, who's the guy working on these issues. Then I travel all over India, find out some people. And one of them is like, Arunachalam Muruganantham, he's the guy who's biopic is very, very famous. It's called Pad Man. So, it is like one of the big blockbuster in India. So, that guy I met and he was kind of inspirational. And then I started arranging machines the materials and the women's and the trainings and scalabilities and everything. So, it's around like six, seven years journey, yeah. So, you're saying it as if it's a very, very simple. Yes, scalability, and that everything, but I would love to hear that story. Because I think that's really where it gets fascinating, how you can actually take this idea, take this poll and bring it to fruition and create a product that actually makes such a strong impact, especially in a population where it's not the same thing as creating a product and marketing it to a bunch of consumers right in the United States. It's a different type of problem, it's a different type of distribution. So, tell me first a little bit about the solution that you found, and then I would love to really talk about the distribution and the scalability of it. How do you get it to all these women? Because it's again, it's a very different industry from those that I'm used to. Yes. So, it is completely different because it's a hygiene kind of industry. And very few people work for that issues because all the multi company come forward and then they take over this. But the problem is, first of all, in our area, it's like agricultural area. And the income of the poor family capital is very, very less. And they mostly spend in like, you know, food and arranging other stuff. So, the women hygiene comes at the very last end. Like here in the United States, we live here, we include the sanity pad and all the hygiene stuff in our monthly budget. So, we buy at the same time like, you know, when we are buying our groceries or vegetables or other things, but not in India. It's not even considered like it is a things to buy. So the thing is like, when the women, they are not getting on the time, they are not educated, they are not aware, we didn't had any kind of syllabus in our book right up to 10th grade that the hygiene should be, you know, included. And this is the prominent issues and all the girls, they should learn about this thing in a school. So, this is like really big issues in our community. So, then what I thought, like, okay, how difficult it is. Right? Because I'm already working in a science side and medical side and other stuff. That time I was working in UCSF. So, then I spoke to the local people like how big this taboo is. And it is a big taboo because nobody wants to talk about this problem. So, first thing, you are a local and you need to talk to the people and convince them that like, I really want to work on this issues in this area only. Because I can work anywhere in India. But why I chose my own district, location, hometown area? Because I understand people and I want to solve that problem from that community. So, then we arrange the machines and then, you know, the material which comes all the way from China, as we all know, like it's all standard. And then we find out the good machines and we hired the women who are actually looking for a job. They are like a daily worker, the daily wage worker. Amazing. Yeah. So, we hired them. We train them what is a hygiene, how to make sanity pads. But it's a very small scale that we were working earlier. But then slowly, we gave them confidence like, hey, this is your product, you are going to work here, and we gave the brand this called No Tension sanitary pad. And they got like very happy like, hey, this is our own products we are making and we are distributing. So, then that gets like really, really around the cities and then the villages. And then we reach out to the more women. Because in India the sector is divided. Like the men's, they work in a different parts and the women, they work in a different work. It's like the industry side, you will find the more men and the less women. But in agriculture, there is like 50%, 50-50. And then there are some certain groups in all the villages like ASHA karykarta workers, those groups, they are only for the women. So, the women to women it's easy to spread out the word, spread out the products. And after that, after manufacturing the pad, then I thought like maybe the education is the most important key to, you know, educate them about the awareness, how to use pads, how to dispose the pad. Because the environmental issue is also coming up in landfilling and plastics and all that. So, we need to approach in a holistic way where we are giving the solution also, we are giving the other solution to dispose the sanitary pad. Because in India we don't have like, you know, things like separation and segregations and all that. We dump at the one place or we burn at the one place. So, this is how this was very critical because, you know, the awareness and the education part. So, I took the place that I will go around that area and stay on the road for, like, you know, a couple of months and educate all the schools and the girls hostel and the Tivoli in terms of the menstrual hygiene, like the awareness program. So, we designed the program, we designed the material. And then I went to 15 tribal area, stayed there for a few days, and then, you know, take the workshop and the conferences and the classes in all, you know, girl kind of a hostel. So, you can meet like larger population from a different villages, you train all the girls, like how to spread this message, how to reach out to other women in your village. Very, very cool. Exactly. So, this program went like really very, very successful and all the media is covered. And it came in the local news so that other people also they were reading. And this was kind of eye openers. And that time the movie was coming like Pad Man. So, eventually my name came up as a pad woman of India. So, this was the time where I spent most of the time on the road, and then I spread out like, you know, I reach out to thousands of girls, women's need it. They had millions of questions like, hey, why this happens, why that happens and so many. And unfortunately, there's no system where they can ask their queries and they can get the right answer and they can study well. Because, you know, when you have something in your mind and you are not getting answers on time, then you cannot focus on your study or in your daily day-to-day life. So, this is how like, you know, we spread out this awareness programs and the sanitary pads all over the places. I think that's just remarkable. Tell me a little bit about the most difficult thing that you've encountered throughout this process. Because you make it sound relatively okay. But I'm sure that it was incredibly difficult. I mean, you're talking about having to find a holistic approach to solving an incredible need within the country that has billions of people, and you're talking about something with a population that doesn't necessarily have also the funds and education to start with. So, I'd love to hear a little bit about the greatest challenges that you've had along the way. Yeah. So, the challenges is like I mean, if I were work in San Francisco, I have an excellent like, you know, teams I can find, I can hire people, I can get the best of the best, you know, talent there. But when you when you go to the grassroots level, work in a very, very like, you know, deep into interior, you had a very hard time to find a suitable person for the suitable job. So, this was my biggest challenge, that I cannot find the accountant, I cannot find a computer guy, I cannot find a data entry because you are living with nothing. There's no I mean, hardly electricity. And you have challenges like network and so many things. So, getting the right team on the right time, understanding, you know, they would understand your issue and you would understand their issue, it's a difficult part. And then other difficult one was because menstrual hygiene is a very, very taboo job in our area. I mean, you cannot talk to the men about the menstrual periods or any kind of issue. Convincing them, telling them, hey, this is your family, so this is your maybe mom issues, sister issues, wife issues, you know, we need to speak up about it. And then sometimes they get like, you know, they hide, they just, you know, feel shy. And even the women also they feel very shy. Like if you if you go to the room and where 10, 20 women are sitting and you start speaking about the period, they will go away. So, you cannot do that. You have to relate with something to something to something and then you come up on the on the real talk like the periods and other sort of issues. Because it's a very, very big taboo. And fighting on that is like it's a hard. So, these kind of issues I faced in the beginning, but when you open about yourself, you train like women and then 10 people other, they are speaking with you with the same issue, then people will believe. Like, hey, this is something that we really need to listen, this is something we really need to talk. So, these are the issues which I go, and I'm still facing the challenges to get the right team, to get the right people for my job in this scalability is very difficult. So, slowly we are training people slowly, slowly we are involving. Right. So, then, you know, things will improve. I know it will be a never ending challenge for us, yeah. Unbelievable. Maya, I have to say that it's inspiring to hear the both the challenges, but also you know, that the incredible work that you're doing over there. I think it's incredibly innovative. And to me personally, it's inspiring to see somebody who goes after such an important topic from the get go. And I want to thank you for being so generous with your time in the past 20 minutes. I'd love for you to share with me three words that you would use to describe yourself. So, in three words, I can say that I'm very fearless, very confident and very, I would say the learner for a lifetime. So, these are the three words which I want to conclude this. Amazing. Maya, thank you very, very much. This was wonderful. Continue making such a positive impact. And stay safe and stay healthy. Yeah, you too. Thank you so much. Happy holidays and happy New Year in advance.
