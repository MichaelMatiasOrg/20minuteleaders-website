Wonderful. Okay. Sandor Valner, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Thank you. Best to be here, buddy. So good to have you. So, we know each other through the J-Ventures Fund. You're actually, you just told me you're considered now a rabbi for the J-Ventures opening up the LA chapter, which is wonderful. And I get to work with your wonderful son as an associate at the Firm and Center. I'd love to spend these 20 minutes getting to know two things that really I know nothing about. Investment banking in Latin America. You're from Mexico. You actually, though, you've got to study in Mexico, in Weizmann institute and at Stanford University, both AI and business. And then, you go to investment banking. So, you're gonna have to give me a little bit of a rundown how that all happened. I'm gonna let you go from now on. Sandor, talk to me a little bit about your background and where you came from. Sure. Born and raised in Mexico, Lithuanian people who escaped the war coming to the United States. Couldn't get into the United States. Stopped in Mexico, liked it there and stayed there. We were raised in Mexico. And then, started schooling initially in Mexico. Then went to the Machon Weizmann for a year. Where in Mexico did you live? Mexico City. I was just there for a week with my good friend from Stanford, Santiago. Beautiful place. It's a great city. I highly recommend it. Great food, great people. Very Israeli, right? I found the people there to be very similar to Israelis in Tel Aviv. Well, it's a fun city. I highly recommend it once we got in to normalcy again, I highly recommend it. Definitely. So, then went to school in Mexico, studied engineering. Then went to Stanford and studied both business and artificial intelligence. Before artificial intelligence was what we now know artificial intelligence is. But needless to say it was very interesting. And then, I started a career of 15 years in investment banking, doing mostly international mergers and acquisitions. And then, shifted my career into private equity real estate. Managed large private equity real estate funds, also, mostly internationally. And sold my interests in the real estate company last year. And I've since been doing angel investing mostly in PropTech and FinTech. And now I'm starting a new tech-enabled investment banking. Amazing. Okay. So, Sandor, I'd love to talk about this intersection of, you're in real estate for a long time. You're an expert in real estate now. Just from my understanding, when you did that, there was traditional real estate, right? Not necessarily techy, AI powered in real estate investing, right? Yeah. This was traditional real estate. We did mostly industrial facilities, and we did a low income housing, and we did offices and shopping centers. Nothing related to tech. How big are we talking here? Is this one or two buildings? Or is this 50, 60 buildings? What's more, what we raised up close to two billion dollars and then we we ended up, I don't know how many properties, but probably a couple of hundred. Wow. So, managing two billion dollars in real estate. Is that right? Yes, we've manage public and private funds. This was part of a larger organization. What I was responsible, the funds, the two billion dollars that I managed were in Latin America. So, it was an interesting ride. Because this crisis that we're living right now, I think is my eighth crisis, in terms of financial crisis. These countries, particularly Mexico, was having crisis every six years. So, unfortunately, I've learned to live through a lot of them. And I can only say to your audience that we're probably gonna have more of them, unfortunately. Sandor, what have you learned after a crisis? Well, I've learned that most of the fortunes, on the economic side are made in the crisis. My GSB professor last quarter told me, "Michael, don't waste a good crisis." Absolutely. Absolutely. The other thing is that I think, the biggest learning experiences are during the crisis. Which is very intense periods where you are forced to really go back to basics. So, in terms of learning and in terms of eventually making money, even though it seems extremely hard at the time, or carving a successful career, obviously, it's not only about money. They're just very good opportunities. So, when you're in the middle of the storm, they're no fun. Right. Definitely. Okay. So, now, going back to this idea, you're managing two billion dollars in real estate assets. And now you're investing in in startups that are doing PropTech. So, what is property technology? And what specifically about it makes you excited, with your expertise looking at real estate as a whole? Well, I think what happened when I left private equity real estate, during my years investing in real estate I just found that it's an industry that is very opaque, very inefficient, and there are many many dimensions which of real estate, which I think can be improved with technology. What are some of  the really, like, opaque parts of it? Well, pricing, right? When you lease a space, office space, you don't really know what everything else is leasing for. You don't really know what the terms of the lease are for competitors. You don't know who's doing what as you do. For example, in the stock market, where there is a very liquid and transparent market. And I think at the end of the day, a lack of liquidity and transparency and all this friction ends up costing everybody. So, I think we would all be better off if we had a more fluid system. Okay. So we're talking about pricing. This idea that you're able to leverage deep technology to really understand markets and understand how to price better. Are there other aspects of real estate that technology can really go into? Many. For example, I'm an investor in a company that is looking to disrupt the construction management industry. And the construction management, you've got architects, engineers, the owners, the bankers, the accountants, the contractors. Everyone interacting, And they don't interact in a single platform. So, everybody speaks different languages. Decisions take forever. There are a lot of inefficiencies. We're trying to build a company that will, it's a collaboration tool where everybody can share information real time and increase efficiencies in construction. Right. Actually, this year, two friends of mine from the GSB were working on a product where they came with a hypothesis that they can look at email conversations between contractors, architects and builders and find and predict how much the project is going to be delayed so that they can warn in advance. Because usually a delay means more money, right? I haven't done construction myself, but from my understanding, a delay means money. And so, if you can predict ahead of time that there's poor communication and therefore delay is gonna come about, you can actually save quite a bit of money. And I think more importantly, you're gonna save quite a bit of headache for all parties. Please ask your friends to give me a call. Because we're trying to build really a platform to do exactly that. To predict delays, avoid delays and cost overruns. I'm going to because I actually believe, that one of the founders, she did her PhD on this. And she actually already had it something working. So, something positive already came out of this talk. But Sandor, back to you. You're dealing with this, you're also part of J-Ventures. Why go into real estate in the first place? What got you excited about real estate? And why real estate in Mexico? Why not in the US, Europe, Israel? Why Mexico? Well, why Mexico? Because I happened to be born there. And my family have historically been in real estate. And I had kind of been riding in real estate. And so, it's a nice business and a stable business. And it also offers the possibility of creating a lot of jobs and improving the standard of living of wherever your acting. And again, I  I thought that it was an industry that is fairly inefficient. And where there inefficiencies there are opportunities to have fun, to innovate, to make money, etc. Right. Okay. Now, you have your own startup. Talk to me a little bit about this one. Yes. We created a company called Network Bankers. It's a tech-enabled investment bank. We put together, We now have a network of over 30,000 CEOs around the world that are part of our network. And we're providing investment banking and investment management services to that group of 30,000 CEOs. So, what does that mean investment banking services? So, basically, investment banking, what I mean by investment banking services in this context is helping these CEOs. Advising them on raising capital, raising debt, or helping them buy or sell companies. Okay. Okay. So, these are not CEOs necessarily of early stage startups that are just raising a few hundred thousand dollars. And I'm guessing these are, later on in their lifecycle. They are, I mean, there's certainly there's some startup CEOs where we can help them raise venture capital money. But most of these CEOs manage small or middle sized companies. And some of them manage hundred million dollar companies plus, but most of them are smaller. And we will help them reach their goals by helping them buy other companies out or selling divisions or raising capital. Or their financial engineers, helping them accomplish their goals. Sure. I have to know, what are some of the biggest challenges of managing hundreds of assets in real estate? How often do you know their values? Because the values are fluctuating especially as in the recent years with the crisis all the way from 2008 up to now, how do you even get a good grasp of your holdings? In my mind, I'm imagining a team of 100 analysts sitting all day and just doing calculations. Is that the case or are there different approaches to this? Well, I mean, you asked several questions. One of the questions you asked is about pricing. You don't know about price. That is one of limitations of real estate. You have indications about what's going on in the markets, but you don't know how much your assets are worth. You can't just look at what the guy next to you sold for? Is that not good enough? You could. But there are just, the transactions are few and far between. It's not like the stock market where you have millions of shares that are trading every day. So, the transactions are limited. But in real estate, the one thing you do have is that they tend to be large and discrete assets. So, you can have a team of two or three people that are monitoring the management of a office building or shopping center. And the real estate has typically you have a team in the real estate fund. You have a team that does, for example, acquisitions. Basically, you evaluate new investments and then you have another team that does asset management, which really means that you have a team that is monitoring your existing investments. They're making sure that the offices are well managed. That their lease, that they have adequate debt, etc, etc. So, you have an external team that even though these funds tend to be rather small funds, we tend to outsource a lot of this asset management, so you end up having hundreds of people, as you'd say, monitoring all of these assets. Not directly employed by the funds, but indirectly from asset management companies. Right. Right. Did this studying AI in the engineering school of Stanford and of course, the business school, did that bring a different paradigm to your thinking behind running the business or how to leverage different technologies to help you? How do you see that education or that part of yourself and your background play into the role of this green investment banking endeavors? Well, I think the computer science background helped me organize my thoughts and helped me look into things as to how they can be scaled and automated. I think, in the back of my mind, I always had that whenever I have a big or difficult problem came about, AI didn't really play much of a role because when I studied AI in 1985 or so, you didn't have the algorithms that you have right now. The learning algorithms just didn't exist. So, it was actually a very frustrated that we were a little bit ahead of our times in terms of technology to do much. We didn't have the computer power. We didn't really have a knowledge of the required algorithms. So, to me, it was actually enlightening. It was really exciting. Once I left real estate, I discover these new things that have been, we've developed an artificial intelligence that now I can, I have a new toy that I can play with, right? I mean, this is a fascinating technology. Incredible. So, I'm really like, if you're like the young kid with a new toy trying to explore something different. And going back to the beginning of the conversation, trying to piece all of the different parts of my career into something that makes sense, which probably never will make sense. But it's an interesting jigsaw puzzle that you assemble throughout your career. But it's been a lot of fun. Definitely. I go into our computer vision course website, the notorious CS231n, it's the graduate school class for  convolutional neural networks for computer vision. And the first thing that you see on the website is a neural network that is able to take an image and classify it. And it's running on the browser. And I can just imagine, to me, coming in as a new student and seeing this fresh and having all the tools at my disposal with a few lines of code and my own personal computer, whether it's amazing or whether it's crappy, I can still run all those algorithms. Even on my phone. I'm sure it's a very different learning experience than in 1980 to 1984 and learning about these algorithms. Sandor, I'm very curious,  looking from up from very high to now going down, buying real estate, also especially for young individuals, all the time you hear in the news about the American dream to own a house, to own an apartment. Israel, also a people my age are constantly thinking about, "Okay, when I'm finally going to be able to make my first real estate investment?" What is your take on this? Is this a rational thing to do as a young person to go in and run after a real estate investment? Is it better in your mind to put it somewhere else? Or is it just like a sexy fad or is there a real meaning behind it? Well, I think you have to go back to basics. Real estate has been a relatively stable asset. That doesn't mean that it's not has its risks. But as long as you don't have a lot of leverage of debt on it, so, a very stable asset. But going back to basics, I mean, one of the things that these crisis teach you is that you should save, right? You really should save for a rainy day because you don't really know when we're gonna be quarantined or when there's going to be a slowdown or when you're out of your job, etc. Second thing you learn is that you really need to diversify your assets. So, your urge to be invested in real estate, that's great. But I don't think anyone should have 99% of their assets in real estate. Even though I love real estate, right? I mean, you should diversify. Why? Because you shouldn't have all your eggs in one basket. You should have it in a few baskets because things happen, right? Right. But all in all, real estate, One is, an investment is stable. It certainly plays a role. But more importantly, it's your house, right? So, you use it and you should enjoy it. And fortunately, in this country, which, by the way, is not the case in most countries in the world, the loan rates, the interest rates are so low that a lot of people can afford buying houses even if they're small at the beginning. This is not the case in many many countries. Right. Unfortunately, these crisis make houses less affordable. So, it's tougher. But this is a tough time. But we're gonna have better times as well. So, be patient. 100%. 100%. Sandor, I want to thank you again for this time and for all the great insights. Before we leave, I have to put you on the spot and ask you my favorite question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself or that your GSB classmates would use to describe you or your partners. Three words to describe, well, it's a good life. It's a good life. Now, it's four. Enjoy. Learn. Enoy. Learn. It's a good life. Learn, make good friends at Stanford. Start companies. Take risks. That was worth much more than three words. Trust me. Right. Thank you so much. Sandor, thank you. Take care. Say hi to your son for me. And stay safe and stay healthy. Will do. Thanks again. Take care. Bye bye.
