1
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,920
Lee Alpert, thank you for being on my show

2
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,600
20 Minute Leader.

3
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,000
It's so good to have you.

4
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,040
Hi, Michael, how are you?

5
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm doing great.

6
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,600
So, every guest that I have on

7
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,640
I ask ahead of time

8
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
how do I pronounce their name

9
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,800
because I flunk about 50% of the names

10
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
with my Israeli accent usually.

11
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,080
But now, since we know each other

12
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,720
for I think about like 12 years,

13
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,800
I didn't have to do that.

14
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,080
So, I feel like this is smooth sailing.

15
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,760
12 years.

16
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,440
Lee, you were at Stanford together.

17
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,280
You helped teach courses

18
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,680
within Stanford Computer Science,

19
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,480
helping other students that are

20
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,720
a few quarters or years behind you

21
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,120
with your new expertise;

22
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,160
product management intern at Intuit;

23
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,640
incredible experiences both in Hong Kong

24
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,200
but also in Greece, working with IsraAID;

25
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,440
and now, most recently, a new program

26
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,160
that we'll hear about near the end.

27
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,560
Lee, I'd love to talk about your journey,

28
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,160
and I'd love to talk about your role

29
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,400
as a section leader at Stanford

30
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,560
and all the other things that I mentioned.

31
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,680
But first of all, who are you Lee Alpert?

32
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,440
Yeah. Hi, everybody listening.

33
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,840
Thank you for having me, Michael.

34
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,640
I'm Lee.

35
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,320
I grew up mostly

36
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,240
between New York and Israel,

37
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,280
so I personally think

38
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,720
I got the best of both worlds

39
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
in that deal.

40
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,120
It's food wise, culture wise,

41
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,440
and just seeing being able to contrast

42
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,520
those two cultures,

43
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,080
that's been incredible.

44
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,700
Give me two sentences on that,

45
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,960
the growing up on the line

46
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,000
between New York and Tel Aviv,

47
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,840
what was that like?

48
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,280
I think it was really interesting,

49
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,560
especially because of the politics

50
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,360
surrounding the Middle East and Israel

51
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,360
and getting perspective on that

52
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,560
from both within

53
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,680
and managing to take a step back

54
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,200
and see the global view on that.

55
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,880
I think it gave me

56
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,320
a very well-rounded perspective.

57
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,840
And sometimes it's hard

58
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,160
because you feel like you're always

59
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,080
maybe disagreeing

60
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,480
or you're always defending

61
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:26,960
or you're always

62
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,760
in these tough conversations.

63
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,240
Well, I have to say that, for me,

64
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,840
it was always a dissonance that especially

65
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,040
when I was in the IDF, taking part

66
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,960
and understanding both sides of the story

67
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,640
and then all of a sudden

68
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,280
traveling for the summer to New York

69
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,760
and opening The New York Times

70
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,200
and seeing things that I didn't really see

71
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,280
in the Israeli news, right?

72
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,760
That's something

73
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,160
that's really interesting.

74
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,760
Yes, definitely.

75
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,240
And I think it goes both ways.

76
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,920
Sometimes you're seeing things

77
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,640
in the states that you never see

78
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,560
or just in the international papers

79
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,640
that you never see in Israel.

80
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
And sometimes,

81
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,280
now there are a lot of protests

82
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,920
going on in Israel.

83
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,800
And I think the voice

84
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,560
that hasn't been heard in a while

85
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,840
in Israel is becoming very vocal.

86
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,160
And to me, that's very exciting.

87
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,600
And that maybe isn't

88
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,400
in the front headlines internationally.

89
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,320
And it makes sense why that isn't so.

90
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,800
But it does help place you

91
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,000
in a more global sense.

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,400
100%.

93
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
Yeah. I think growing up with that

94
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,360
was very important

95
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,400
in shaping my perspectives on that.

96
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,600
And it's definitely something

97
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,800
I'm still always learning how to navigate,

98
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,560
both with those two cultures

99
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,440
and any others I'm experiencing.

100
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,080
Well, just as a dramatic shift to this

101
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,040
to go between between Israel and New York

102
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,000
throughout the years,

103
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,000
you went to the Israel Defense Forces,

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,320
you spent several years there

105
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,880
being with it, primarily Israelis,

106
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,720
and then one clear day you wake up

107
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,400
and you were at Stanford University

108
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,680
in a completely different world.

109
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,240
Start with that first experience.

110
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,680
Tell me a little bit about the IDF

111
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,360
and what was that experience like for you?

112
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
So, I was a medic,

113
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,200
which I have absolutely loved.

114
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,760
It was really incredible.

115
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,220
And I think what I always say

116
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,760
of my time in the Army is,

117
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,640
it was so incredibly different

118
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,600
from anything I had done before

119
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,800
or will do after.

120
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,200
It was just so unique.

121
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,560
We had attended

122
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,360
an international school beforehand.

123
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,200
So, a lot of people

124
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,040
we went to school with,

125
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,960
and there was a variation,

126
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,440
a lot went to foreign affairs,

127
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,520
I ended up as a medic in a very small base

128
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,360
in the Golan Heights

129
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,200
by the Syrian community.

130
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,840
Why medic? i thought that you would go

131
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,120
into a variety of places,

132
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,200
I didn't think medic would be one of them.

133
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,000
Not because it's not fantastic,

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,160
because I just didn't realize

135
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,400
that you had an interest in a medic.

136
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,480
Yeah. I guess,

137
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,280
it was something I fell into.

138
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,280
I definitely wanted to try something new.

139
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,760
I wanted that intense experience

140
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,800
of being on a smaller base,

141
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,840
being on a base where I would spend

142
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,520
bigger chunks of time there.

143
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,760
And I really got that.

144
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,080
I was exposed to all types of people

145
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,320
I never would have met

146
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,200
from every socioeconomic status,

147
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,600
that's really important.

148
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,220
And then being a medic

149
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,640
and especially in the military,

150
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,440
I think, if you study medicine

151
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,040
and of course I understand why,

152
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,480
but if you study medicine

153
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,400
in really any other space,

154
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,840
takes a long time

155
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,800
before you're poking someone.

156
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,000
Whereas in the IDF,

157
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,760
because of resources and just time,

158
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,600
it's really you're just going

159
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,240
and you're learning by practicing

160
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,840
on each other.

161
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,930
And it can get a little gory.

162
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,680
Medics getting fun

163
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,760
for starting to like that gore.

164
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,480
But I loved it.

165
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,400
I realized, I really liked

166
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,280
the component of helping people.

167
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,760
I liked the more intense training.

168
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,880
And you never know

169
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,760
until you're really in the situation.

170
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,480
But it was cool to learn about myself

171
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,800
that I could handle that

172
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,760
and that I was calm under pressure.

173
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,160
I think that was, I even sometimes

174
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,560
was made fun of for it a bit.

175
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,160
Soldiers would come in panicking,

176
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,440
and the first thing I would do

177
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,040
I don't ask what's wrong, I just,

178
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,840
"Okay, relax. Everyone take a breath."

179
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,320
And I think that applies

180
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,520
to anything in life.

181
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,760
And same as really just learning to work

182
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,000
with limited resources

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,400
and making things happen.

184
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,480
I have to say, so, a lot of people,

185
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,480
especially in around Silicon Valley,

186
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,360
they talk about the startup nation.

187
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,400
And one of the things that Singer

188
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,280
and his co-author talked about

189
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,120
in the Start-up Nation book

190
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,480
is this idea of resilience

191
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,840
and the quick path to maturity

192
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,920
through the IDF.

193
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,280
And while a lot of them are talking about

194
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,200
the 8200 or the elite intelligence units

195
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,480
as key factors for the startup nation,

196
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,040
people like also Eric Schmidt,

197
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,200
they talk about this exact

198
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,960
what you're talking about

199
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,880
this idea that you're being faced,

200
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,640
you're being placed

201
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,400
in these high stress situations.

202
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,520
And at the age of 18, 19, you learn

203
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,920
that the most important thing you can do

204
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,720
when somebody comes in panicking

205
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,920
is to calm them down

206
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,960
and calmly assess the situation.

207
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,120
And so, for me, that's a perfect example

208
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,480
of also something that I felt

209
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,040
that I gained through the IDF.

210
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,480
But I'd love to also transition out

211
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,800
to Stanford and hear about

212
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,360
what are that experiences like,

213
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,000
moving from putting the uniform down,

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,520
getting on a plane and finding yourself

215
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,520
in the beautiful Silicon Valley

216
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,120
in one of the most beautiful campuses

217
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,880
in the world.

218
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,120
Yeah, definitely.

219
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,760
It happened really fast.

220
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,600
I was sending in my applications

221
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,840
while hot spotting from my bunk bed

222
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,920
in the Golan Heights.

223
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,960
And then, within the span

224
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,000
of less than a year,

225
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,440
I was going from being a medic to,

226
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,360
I probably waitressed or bartended a bit,

227
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,880
got a little bit of time to travel,

228
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,960
and then I was a student

229
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,360
at Stanford University

230
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,880
which still blows my mind sometimes.

231
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,120
And I think I knew it would be a change.

232
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,960
And I knew it would be hard

233
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,520
to go back into school

234
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,320
after being out for a while.

235
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,520
And in some ways, it was even more so

236
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,200
than what I expected.

237
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,520
There was definitely one night

238
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,120
where I re-taught myself

239
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,520
what basic trigonometry was

240
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,800
the night before.

241
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,840
I'm still trying to re-teach myself.

242
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,160
So, you're fine.

243
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,880
Oh, yeah. When you hear everyone talking

244
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,680
about how they forgot

245
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,040
about their math over summer

246
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,800
and then they're just nodding, yeah.

247
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,240
Yeah, those three, four years ago, right.

248
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,320
But it's been an incredible journey.

249
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,600
I got so lucky, I think,

250
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,760
just really met incredible people.

251
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,160
Learning I think, how to navigate it

252
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,680
and make the most of all the opportunities

253
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,080
because we're so fortunate in that.

254
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,000
There's just so many

255
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,360
incredible opportunities at Stanford.

256
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,960
And sometimes, it's almost so much

257
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,520
you feel bad

258
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,800
that you can't make everything.

259
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,120
You can't make every amazing speaker.

260
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,800
And I think, with time, you really learn

261
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,720
how to navigate that

262
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,760
and make the most of it

263
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,720
and you get really excited

264
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,480
and it's so cool.

265
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Lee, give me one thing

266
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,680
that truly surprised you when you came.

267
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,000
You come in to Stanford, you're like,

268
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,440
"Wow. When I was back in Israel,

269
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,560
I did not realize

270
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,840
that this is going to be like this."

271
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,880
Oh, that's a tough one.

272
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,080
I think, honestly, for me,

273
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,040
a lot of it was just all these interests

274
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,520
that I really picked up.

275
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,080
And things that you have,

276
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,880
I guess, actually,

277
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,720
you probably knew me back then

278
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,800
but I don't know if you know this,

279
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,920
but I think, 12 year old Lee,

280
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,840
if you told her

281
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,800
she would be excited by FinTech,

282
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,240
or would have gone to computer science

283
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,320
or some business and technology

284
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,080
and get this excited, I don't know

285
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,840
if she would have believed you.

286
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,200
But I think it's discovering

287
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,520
all these different passions

288
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,640
and even the areas that you don't go into,

289
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,600
I have so much respect for all of my peers

290
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,160
that I see doing incredible things

291
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,920
in other spaces.

292
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,080
I have to say that for myself,

293
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,600
one of the things that really surprised me

294
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,720
was the amount of passion that I saw.

295
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,520
So, I knew it was a great institution,

296
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,400
I knew that it was a beautiful campus

297
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,800
and that the professors were great,

298
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
but sitting alongside peers that,

299
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,560
I looked at them as 18 year old,

300
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,680
people that I commanded,

301
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,560
soldiers that were older than them

302
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,320
just a month before I got to Stanford,

303
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,000
literally a month.

304
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,440
And for me, walking there

305
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,920
and thinking of them as children

306
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,360
and all of a sudden seeing their passion

307
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,120
and seeing them as equals

308
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,320
and we're having so much fun

309
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,280
and they're much smarter than me

310
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,400
and much better than me,

311
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,960
I think, to me, that was the greatest.

312
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,480
Talk to me, you choose to go

313
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,600
into computer science

314
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,040
and you go through that track.

315
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,800
You go through the systematic track

316
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,600
of the famous classes that we have

317
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,200
in our 106 series, and then you become

318
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,360
a sort of a teacher,

319
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,400
assistant section leader for that.

320
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,560
Yeah, definitely.

321
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,440
And I'll agree with you completely

322
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,440
on the passion component.

323
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,920
I think it's inspiring.

324
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,800
And it's people of every age, right?

325
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,880
It's 18 year olds, it's professors,

326
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,680
it's business students.

327
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,080
And for me, I didn't go in

328
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,920
unknowing I would do computer science.

329
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,800
I think a part of me almost tried

330
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
to not do that

331
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,880
because so many people were doing it.

332
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,160
But I took one course and I took another

333
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,680
and somehow it went okay, yeah,

334
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,800
or even well.

335
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,120
And I really enjoyed it.

336
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,320
And I liked how it teaches you

337
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,680
to break down problems

338
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,120
and think of the world.

339
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,200
And I think anyone who's ever coded

340
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,640
knows that there's no better feeling

341
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,600
of getting it to work right

342
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,200
after struggling with something.

343
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,520
And I got really lucky.

344
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,480
And I had incredible section leaders

345
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,720
and incredible teaching assistants

346
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,440
and professors during my courses.

347
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,760
And I've been very intimidated.

348
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,360
Stanford computer science,

349
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,080
I had no experience.

350
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,240
It was something I was scared of.

351
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,440
And then I finally got around

352
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,640
to doing it and I loved it.

353
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,280
And I thought,

354
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,200
Okay, I would like to be

355
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,080
one of the people who helped me

356
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,000
first get into this.

357
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,320
And I would like to help

358
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,120
teach this course.

359
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,920
I love it.

360
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,680
And it was great.

361
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,520
And you actually mentioned that

362
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,960
teaching students in the US [--],

363
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,360
but that's not necessarily true.

364
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,000
It's actually one of the most

365
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,960
commonly taken courses at Stanford

366
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,880
and we definitely see law students

367
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,160
taking it, too.

368
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,880
And it's just such a good place.

369
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,120
And it's great to see

370
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,320
what a variety of students

371
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,440
can enjoy this course,

372
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,080
whether it's computer science

373
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,160
as their main field of study or not.

374
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,480
So, Lee, paint me a picture.

375
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,600
Because it is one

376
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,080
of the most popular courses at Stanford.

377
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,440
It's notorious for being excellent

378
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,800
and excellent course that's been developed

379
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,240
over more than a decade.

380
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,280
The year actually

381
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,560
that you were section leading it,

382
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,880
so teaching other students,

383
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,160
you actually would change

384
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,960
an entire language from Java to Python,

385
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,840
which is I'm sure

386
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,880
was an interesting transition,

387
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,160
but paint me a picture.

388
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,920
A new student arrives at Stanford,

389
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,840
they go into the first

390
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,760
computer science class,

391
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,480
this is an incredible experience,

392
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,320
and I'd love for you

393
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,400
to maybe paint me a picture

394
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,080
of what that's like and what is the role

395
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,280
of the section leader

396
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,280
within that experience?

397
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
Yes, definitely.

398
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,520
And I think this is something very unique

399
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,080
that happens at Stanford.

400
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,960
And, of course,

401
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,160
it's dependent on resources.

402
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
But just a great model for teaching

403
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,360
is that in addition to these

404
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,880
very large lectures

405
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,720
with incredible professors,

406
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,440
they also really hire and teach and train

407
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,680
and make this community of students

408
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,120
who will help

409
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,520
with the teaching themselves.

410
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,720
And then you meet with students

411
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,960
in smaller groups,

412
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,600
maybe about 10 students once a week,

413
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,240
to reiterate what they learned in lecture

414
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,720
to actually do problem solving.

415
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,480
And for context, the lectures themselves

416
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,960
can be sometimes 300, 400 students, right?

417
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,440
Which is what people are looking

418
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,000
from the time and saying,

419
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,120
"This is not personalized."

420
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,280
"It's 400 students."

421
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,440
But the section is where you really get

422
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,880
the added value, right?

423
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,480
Yes. And for me, I remember

424
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,040
those were so helpful.

425
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,280
Just getting that practice

426
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,000
as opposed to lecture style learning,

427
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,600
which personally and I think

428
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,400
for many people, is a lot harder.

429
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,080
And then, also, when we grade their work,

430
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,720
we actually sit with students one on one.

431
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,200
We leave them notes virtually,

432
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,280
but we also meet with them in person

433
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,320
and really go over what went great;

434
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,960
what could have gone a little better;

435
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,400
how can they improve;

436
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,000
maybe give them ideas

437
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,840
for how they can take this

438
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,600
one step further,

439
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,880
go beyond the scope of the assignment.

440
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,120
And then there's also

441
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,280
a ton of office hours.

442
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,120
And I think it's that level

443
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,480
of feedback and interaction

444
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,040
that really sets us apart

445
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,480
and is the reason why these courses

446
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,800
get such great feedback

447
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,520
from every type of student.

448
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,000
And it's also great to see

449
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,040
how they've really built

450
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,880
this community of instructors

451
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,800
and they really value

452
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,120
and want our feedback

453
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,440
and how the course is going

454
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,160
both in the syllabus content style

455
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,040
of instruction in order to improve it.

456
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,440
Since they understand

457
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,200
that we have so much contact

458
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,560
with the students.

459
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,480
It reminds me a lot of the IDF mentorship

460
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,960
where age is not the factor.

461
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,840
Sometimes it's just another peer

462
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,920
that's teaching new material,

463
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,640
even though you may be more professional

464
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,520
in other fields like you have law.

465
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,920
Like second year law students

466
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,460
who are coming in

467
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,800
and you're teaching them computer science

468
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,120
and you're grading their work.

469
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,240
What do you tell a student

470
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,160
that is just starting out?

471
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,280
Because you're section leading

472
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,320
for one of the introductory

473
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,440
computer science courses,

474
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,200
which is the beginning of the funnel.

475
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,840
And one of the greatest challenges

476
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,920
that I know the faculty

477
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,080
and all around the world are dealing with,

478
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,840
both the diversity issue

479
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,520
that of the funnel, it's primarily males,

480
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,760
unfortunately, that continue.

481
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,280
And the reasons are flawed for that.

482
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,720
Because it actually turned out,

483
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,520
I believe I read a few research reports

484
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,160
that actually females perform better

485
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
in those courses than males do.

486
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,040
So, it's more of a social issue.

487
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,080
But what do you tell somebody

488
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,040
who's starting out

489
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,080
and they're having some trouble,

490
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,280
they're scared, it's difficult,

491
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,560
they don't recognize the language,

492
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,000
and they meet with Lee Alpert,

493
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,200
who's their section leader,

494
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,560
and they look at you as the teacher

495
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,200
because you're the one grading their work.

496
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,080
I think there are a lot of things.

497
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,800
One, and we do talk about this

498
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,760
and how to approach this problem.

499
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,400
I think, one the biggest thing I do is

500
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,120
I try to tell them,

501
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,040
"This was so hard for me too."

502
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,080
No one gets this right away

503
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,080
And also reflect on how far they've come

504
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,040
since they started.

505
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,040
And I think it's trying to find a way

506
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,960
to teach it which works for that student,

507
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,720
because not everyone is the same learner.

508
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,400
And there's so many different ways

509
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,360
to approach a problem,

510
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,280
especially in computer science.

511
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,960
And I think it's not giving up

512
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,400
and looking for that approach

513
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,480
that's right for the student.

514
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,520
And I think, it's actually really exciting

515
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,080
that you brought up this diversity,

516
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,960
because I'm not sure if you are part

517
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,240
of code in place that was,

518
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,400
No. Not this past quarter. No.

519
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,560
Tell me about it.

520
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,880
Yeah. It was this

521
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,520
really exciting initiative

522
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,080
that came together very fast

523
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,000
by some of the biggest

524
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,480
computer science professors at Stanford

525
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,120
and people who are involved

526
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,520
in the section leading program.

527
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,760
And they wanted to make this course,

528
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,640
or at least the first five weeks of it

529
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,520
accessible globally.

530
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,200
We have so many people studying remote.

531
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,040
For free?

532
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,000
For free. For free, remotely,

533
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
but have this style of teaching

534
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,800
incorporated into this program.

535
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,480
The same idea of section leading?

536
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,080
Same small cohorts?

537
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,240
Yes. So, in order to achieve that,

538
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,480
because, oh, I wish

539
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,520
I have the numbers for you,

540
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,560
but I know that we had

541
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,800
thousands of students

542
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,240
and we also had thousands

543
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,120
of volunteer teachers,

544
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,000
which was really really cool.

545
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,520
And I got to actually help train

546
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,120
some of those volunteer teachers

547
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,760
in the way that we do the section leading.

548
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,880
And it was great.

549
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,320
I had my Norwegian cousin

550
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,520
took the course.

551
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,120
People from all over the world

552
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,560
took this course

553
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,200
and it was really cool to see.

554
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,640
And the completion rates

555
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,920
for free courses that are in the style

556
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,560
tend to be really low because sometimes,

557
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,440
there isn't that intent.

558
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
If you're not getting a grade,

559
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,400
you haven't paid for it,

560
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,240
so, you don't feel the need.

561
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,040
But I think we did really well.

562
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,160
And it was such a cool

563
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,520
global process to see.

564
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,840
Especially with this issue of diversity

565
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,840
being so important.

566
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,440
Wow. Okay. Lee, all of that

567
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,000
is just fascinating.

568
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But I want to make sure that I leave

569
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,240
two or three minutes to talk about

570
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,400
what you did in Greece.

571
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,400
I remember following your journey

572
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,560
on social media back then

573
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,400
and it was inspiring.

574
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,800
And you were volunteering there

575
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,880
for quite some time.

576
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,240
What were you doing with IsraAID

577
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,120
over in Lesvos, Greece?

578
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,800
Yes. So, I was a humanitarian fellow

579
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,760
with them.

580
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,360
IsraAID is a nonprofit that works really,

581
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,280
they go for humanitarian disasters

582
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,360
all over the world.

583
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,400
I was focused on their project

584
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,040
in Lesvos, Greece.

585
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,680
Unfortunately, Lesvos, Greece,

586
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,800
because of its location near Turkey,

587
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,520
became really when the refugee crisis

588
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,600
was at its peak, approximately 2015,

589
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,200
a lot of refugees from all over the world

590
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,720
were trying to access the EU

591
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,840
through the small island in Greece

592
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,840
on the border of Turkey.

593
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,640
And it was just a crisis.

594
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,440
It's home to Moria refugee camp,

595
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,320
named in a lot of articles

596
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,000
as one of the worst refugee camps

597
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,360
in the world.

598
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,240
And I was there helping with medical

599
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,360
and educational programs.

600
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,240
And it's really one of the most

601
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,440
important things I've done.

602
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,640
I got so much exposure.

603
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,600
I'm still in touch

604
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,480
with so many of the people I work with.

605
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,600
They're both people who are volunteers

606
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,760
and people who are themselves

607
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,680
asylum seekers.

608
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,920
How long did you spend on the island?

609
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,640
A month and a half, I think.

610
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,440
Wow.

611
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,920
And then I continue to stay in touch

612
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,520
with people and I try to speak at events

613
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,280
about what I've done.

614
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,400
And what was really neat there,

615
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,280
and the big lesson I learned there

616
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,080
was also just how I got involved with them

617
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,240
in the first place.

618
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,480
It definitely remains

619
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,120
one of the most important

620
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,360
life experiences I've had.

621
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,760
And I got involved with it

622
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,560
because a friend,

623
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,560
they were speaking at Stanford,

624
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,480
a friend knew of my interests in the area

625
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,640
and just suggested I come.

626
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,560
And I think a big lesson I got out of that

627
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,120
and continue to try and implement now

628
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,760
and hopefully always is just

629
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,960
make your passions known,

630
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,920
help each other out,

631
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,240
and then those around you

632
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,160
will let you know of opportunities,

633
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,640
there will be so much for you,

634
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,600
and to help each other out in that case

635
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,720
and connect friends

636
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,240
and make all of those things happen.

637
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,640
I think it's also inspiring

638
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,080
that as you come to Stanford,

639
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,200
you hear very quickly is,

640
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,400
what is your next internship;

641
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,360
and what a huge company

642
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,480
are you going to work at;

643
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,400
and what big name

644
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,610
are you going to put on your CV.

645
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,040
And the fact

646
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,120
that you're putting that aside

647
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,640
and you're saying,

648
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,440
"I want to first pursue a passion

649
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,520
and I want to pursue something

650
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,800
that I can actually make a dent

651
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,280
and an impact on people's lives."

652
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,600
And only through following you

653
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,440
a little bit through that summer,

654
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,640
I know that you've impacted so many lives.

655
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,080
So, I think

656
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,720
that's a really important message

657
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,520
that definitely people that I talk to

658
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,880
in freshman year at Stanford,

659
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,040
I try to share as well.

660
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,760
But Lee, I can't believe 20 minutes go by

661
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,520
way too fast. It's unbelievable.

662
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,360
But before we leave,

663
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,560
I have to ask you for three words

664
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,280
that you would use to describe yourself.

665
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,920
Yes, definitely.

666
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,720
I think, this is always a hard question.

667
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,360
It's the hardest.

668
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,360
We were just reflecting that Stanford asks

669
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,160
a similar question

670
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,000
on their  application process

671
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,400
and how difficult it was to answer.

672
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,360
It was hard then. It's hard now.

673
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,800
I think, I would like to hope

674
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,600
that thoughtful, that I take time

675
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,240
to consider a lot of perspectives

676
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,520
on each issue, i'm delving into.

677
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,480
Passionate. That if you do something,

678
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,760
give it 100%.

679
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,160
And excited just about all the things

680
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,240
there are to do and see.

681
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,000
I love it.

682
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,440
Lee, thank you very much. Toda raba.

683
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,880
Unfortunately, I don't think

684
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,040
I'll see you at campus

685
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,720
in the very very near future,

686
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,920
but hopefully later on.

687
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,000
And continue doing good for the world

688
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,840
and inspiring others.

689
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,880
Thank you very much.

690
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,920
Thank you, Michael.

691
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,600
Have a good one.

692
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,400
Wonderful.
