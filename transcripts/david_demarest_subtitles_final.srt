217
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,160
Wonderful.

218
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,480
Professor David Demarest,

219
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,400
thank you so much for being

220
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,130
on 20 Minute Leaders.

221
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:55,835
Happy to be here.

222
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,240
Such an honor to have you here.

223
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,160
You know you are one of my

224
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,160
favorite, favorite professors

225
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,360
of my one year at Stanford,

226
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,440
but I'm sure looking back

227
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,000
at the four years

228
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,760
you're still gonna be

229
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,920
one of my favorite professors

230
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,400
because the amount of inspiration

231
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,160
that you gave me and

232
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,120
I think 19 others in the class

233
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,280
is just unparalleled to

234
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,800
what we could have hoped for.

235
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,800
Professor Demarest, you were

236
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,600
one of the head of communications

237
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,080
for the George Bush Sr. administration

238
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,160
in the White House.

239
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,960
Bank of America, Visa with branding

240
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,880
and communications

241
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,640
and an expert on strategy.

242
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,920
I just wanna hear stories

243
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,640
over these 20 minutes and hear,

244
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,880
you know, some of the incredible

245
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,440
lessons that you taught us.

246
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,600
Professor, can you tell me a little bit

247
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,560
about where you came from

248
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,840
and how you even got to be

249
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,580
in communications

250
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,000
for George Bush Senior?

251
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,240
Well, I have been active in politics

252
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,160
generally, for a number of years.

253
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,720
Helping to rebuild what was then

254
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,440
a struggling political party,

255
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,640
meaning the Republican Party

256
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,580
in the late 70s

257
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,600
and had some success doing that.

258
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,080
Reagan was elected in 1980.

259
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,360
And my boss, who was the chairman

260
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,880
of the Republican Party,

261
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,120
became the U.S. trade representative.

262
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,760
And he asked me to come run

263
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,080
public affairs for that cabinet agency.

264
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,000
And that started a career in government

265
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,200
that went on for about 12 years.

266
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,000
But there was one break,

267
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,640
and that was when I had the opportunity

268
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,160
to be Communications Director

269
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,240
for the first President Bush's

270
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,720
presidential campaign in '88.

271
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,520
And it was an absolute honor

272
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,520
to work for him, but also

273
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,040
to play on a national stage.

274
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,400
I had been Assistant Secretary of Labor.

275
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,160
I had a long career in politics

276
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,840
and government, as I mentioned,

277
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,920
but having the opportunity

278
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,480
to work at that level,

279
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,600
nationally was really very exciting.

280
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,160
I'm sure. Yeah.

281
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,880
And then he won.

282
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,440
And I went into the White House

283
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:58,920
as the White House's

284
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,080
communications director.

285
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,640
It was a wild ride.

286
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,840
And I think one of the things that

287
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,800
I took from that

288
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,280
was to always maintain

289
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,240
your perspective that this

290
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,960
was not a permanent job.

291
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,920
The White House careers

292
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,960
rise and fall overnight.

293
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,400
You have to be able to accept that.

294
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,080
The demands on your time

295
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,240
and your energy are extraordinary.

296
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,080
You have to be able to accept that.

297
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,640
But throughout it all,

298
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,520
I think one of the things that served me

299
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,440
very well was that I never sort of

300
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,400
took that job as an entitlement.

301
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,240
That it was a job that I

302
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,640
was privileged to have.

303
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,680
I was privileged to serve

304
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,000
President Bush,

305
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,680
but I knew that

306
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,760
it was going to end

307
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,480
at some point

308
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,240
whether it was gonna

309
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,520
to be two years, three years,

310
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,120
four years, eight years,
whatever it was gonna be.

311
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,000
It was gonna be over.

312
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,040
And I couldn't let myself think

313
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,280
that that was my kind of my life.

314
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,040
And I think keeping things

315
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,600
in perspective like that

316
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,680
helped me when

317
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,280
he did not win his re-election.

318
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,280
I was out of work for eight months.

319
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,760
And it never really

320
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,320
caused me significant distress.

321
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,160
And I think about what's happening today

322
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,120
with all the dislocation

323
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,480
that people are undergoing.

324
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,720
It's heartbreaking

325
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,760
in many cases.

326
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,360
People are losing their businesses,

327
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,080
or their livelihoods.

328
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,800
But this, too, shall pass.

329
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,720
And if you look at the positives

330
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,960
that have come from this,

331
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,760
people that I have talked with and,

332
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:51,080
I acknowledge that I am privileged

333
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,680
and have some resources.

334
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,040
But the time I've been able to spend

335
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,160
with my family has been extraordinary.

336
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,920
The time that I've had to think about

337
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,480
the next phase of my teaching

338
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,200
has been a godsend.

339
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,440
Just the ability to kind of reflect

340
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,760
and sit back and take it all in

341
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:19,520
and think about next steps.

342
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,440
You know, looking at all of this

343
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,920
not as a threat,

344
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,520
but an opportunity

345
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,800
I think is incredibly important.

346
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,160
So professor, what I

347
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,360
of course forgot to mention,

348
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,640
which I tried to imply,

349
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,400
was that you're a

350
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,720
distinguished professor of the

351
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,760
Stanford Business School.

352
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,240
I got to take a class with you

353
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,360
as an undergraduate

354
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,920
because you so kindly

355
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,400
agreed to teach an undergraduate

356
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,000
class on strategy.

357
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,560
And really you could replace

358
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,120
the name strategy with the name

359
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,160
context between us, correct?

360
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
But I think it's an incredible

361
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,880
... what's happening today.

362
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,200
But I have to know,

363
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,120
you're in the White House.

364
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,600
How often do you go

365
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
into the Oval Office?

366
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,240
How often do you interact

367
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,200
with President Bush?

368
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,360
And what is that

369
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,160
sense of responsibility feel like

370
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,360
when you know that

371
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,800
you're at a position

372
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,280
that perhaps every American,

373
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,440
most Americans can't even imagine

374
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,000
to be sitting where you're sitting?

375
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,800
Well, you know,

376
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,440
it's an incredible honor.

377
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,320
I probably went into the Oval Office

378
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,240
to meet with the president

379
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,640
every other day.

380
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,000
Wow.

381
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,040
Now, having said that,

382
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,120
the first time I went

383
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,240
into the Oval Office, when he

384
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,360
called me in to work on a speech,

385
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,040
he didn't like the speech

386
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,440
that had been delivered to him

387
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,280
and he wanted,

388
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,600
he was uncomfortable with it.

389
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,120
Yeah.

390
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,120
And I got this call saying the president

391
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,440
wants to see you in the Oval Office.

392
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,720
Well, of course, my heart started thumping.

393
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,400
And I walk in and I sit down

394
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,440
and he starts saying,

395
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,000
"I'm not sure the speech

396
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,760
hits all the right notes.

397
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,320
I know a lot of these people.

398
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,400
A lot of 'em are friends of mine."

399
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,800
These were CEOs that he was

400
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,600
going to be talking to at a luncheon.

401
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,560
And he says, "The

402
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,120
they probably are doing a lot of the

403
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,880
community activities already.

404
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,640
I don't want to talk down to them"

405
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,880
Meanwhile, I'm sitting there and I'm

406
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,600
looking around the room thinking,

407
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,560
"Holy mackerel, I am in the Oval Office"

408
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,440
He then says, "Okay?"

409
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,880
And I realized the meeting is over.

410
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,360
And I haven't heard a thing he said.

411
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,800
And I couldn't very well say to him,

412
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,840
"You know, I really wasn't

413
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,000
paying much attention

414
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,680
because I was so overwhelmed

415
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,320
by looking at the grandfather clock

416
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,440
and the two seats where the heads

417
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,520
of state sit and the oval rug

418
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,440
with the presidential

419
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,360
seal on it and all that"

420
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,280
And so, I got up and I walked out

421
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,280
and I thought to myself,

422
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,880
"I am screwed.

423
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,520
I have no idea how to make

424
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,920
this speech right."

425
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,800
And it's a longer story than that,

426
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,840
but you know,

427
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,920
I've taken major celebrities

428
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,440
into the Oval Office

429
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
to meet with the president.

430
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,400
And they, too, are awed.

431
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,840
I took Michael Jackson

432
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,560
into the Oval Office.

433
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,000
You know, the gloved one.

434
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,240
Right.

435
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,080
You walked next to Michael Jackson

436
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,200
and ushered him

437
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,040
into the Oval Office.

438
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,880
I did.

439
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:33,320
And it was a very bizarre meeting.

440
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,280
And it was just,

441
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,240
it was surreal,

442
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,040
is what it was. But -

443
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,120
How does that even work?

444
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,840
So somebody says, somebody who is well known

445
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
and has a lot of impact

446
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,320
can just say,

447
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,760
"Hey, I wanna meet with the president.

448
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,320
Get me an hour in the Oval Office"?

449
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,480
No, it doesn't quite work that way.

450
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,400
I had, one of my staff had heard

451
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,320
from Michael Jackson's people

452
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,320
that he wanted to see

453
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,240
the Lincoln Bedroom.

454
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,840
He wanted to visit the White House

455
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,680
and see the Lincoln Bedroom.

456
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:09,280
And we then said let's up this and

457
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,200
have him do a photo with the

458
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,920
president in the Oval Office.

459
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,040
Well, little did I know

460
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,640
that he was going to bring

461
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,800
a big entourage with him.

462
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,200
And so, I had to cleave

463
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,640
the entourage from him

464
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,560
and I made him come up

465
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,600
and meet with me in my office first.

466
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,120
That was sort of a bizarre meeting.

467
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,680
And then I didn't ever let him

468
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,560
link back up with his entourage

469
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,040
and just took him

470
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,120
and his manager into the Oval Office.

471
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,160
This is just incredible.

472
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:41,720
He didn't exactly connect

473
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,320
with the president.

474
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,240
But he did connect with Mrs. Bush.

475
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,920
And it was a very

476
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,600
interesting interaction.

477
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,520
Wow.

478
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,880
What I didn't know,

479
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,320
and this was the mischievous part

480
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,240
of President Bush,

481
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,240
as he's in the Oval Office, he says

482
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,920
"Now Michael, we're gonna go out and do

483
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,120
what we call a photo opportunity."
Like Michael didn't know what that was.

484
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,840
"We're gonna go out into the Rose Garden

485
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,920
and I'm gonna have a few remarks

486
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,200
about Mr. Gorbachev."

487
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,560
And the press secretary

488
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,720
and myself are thinking, "What?

489
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,400
He's gonna walk out

490
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,320
into the Rose Garden

491
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,120
where there's this enormous

492
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,680
gaggle of reporters

493
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,840
with Michael Jackson

494
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,920
and he's gonna talk about Gorbachev?"

495
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,160
He walks out into the Oval,

496
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,120
into the Rose Garden,

497
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,280
and he announces the first

498
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,360
summit meeting with the Soviet Union.

499
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,680
Standing with Michael Jackson.

500
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,840
It was a surreal moment

501
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,440
beyond surreal moments.

502
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,520
And all we could think of,

503
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,360
and Marlin Fitzwater the press secretary

504
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,560
got into a kind of a giggle about it,

505
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,880
was that we imagined the KGB

506
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,640
watching us and trying to figure out

507
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,600
why is he announcing this

508
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,040
with Michael Jackson?

509
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,160
What is the significance of this?

510
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,560
And we got quite a kick out of it.

511
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,840
That's just incredible.

512
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,520
And then it was just pure George Bush

513
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,200
Of course. Of course.

514
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,560
OK, Professor Demarest, moving on.

515
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,880
You're Director

516
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,830
of Communications and Branding at

517
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,680
two of the most incredible corporations

518
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,720
that really have both critical

519
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,110
infrastructure in our daily lives

520
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,600
but it really changed the way we

521
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,830
interact with our financial institutions

522
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,600
and with responsibilities greater

523
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,840
than just financial institutions.

524
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:23,840
Some of the case studies

525
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,160
that we've studied in our class

526
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,080
from your positions there just showed us

527
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,350
how these corporations,

528
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,760
their impact goes far beyond just

529
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,800
the exchange of money

530
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,070
and storing our money.

531
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,110
That's Bank of America

532
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,160
and Visa of course.

533
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,270
So what did you learn

534
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,160
running communications and branding

535
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,600
for these incredible incredible companies?

536
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,160
Well, I think the biggest learning

537
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,350
that I had from that experience

538
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,400
was to understand that brand

539
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,640
is much more than just a logo.

540
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:02,000
Brand is much more than a presentation.

541
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,750
Brand is really about a promise.

542
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,550
And it's a promise to customers.

543
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,750
It could be a promise to the community.

544
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,920
It could be a promise about

545
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,240
social responsibility.

546
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,600
All large, impactful organizations

547
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,760
make promises to a wide

548
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,310
range of constituencies.

549
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,750
Right.

550
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,560
And their reputation is dependent upon

551
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,080
whether those constituencies

552
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,350
to whom the promise is made

553
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,310
believe that it has been a promise kept.

554
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,400
And so, it's changed my thinking about

555
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,640
how to understand reputation,

556
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,830
how to understand brand,

557
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,480
and in a much the lens that I look

558
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,320
at at brand is a much wider lens

559
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,270
than it was previously.

560
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,070
Right.

561
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,200
The other thing I think I learned

562
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:59,040
primarily at the latter stage

563
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,760
of my corporate career was

564
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,750
how important strategic thinking is.

565
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,110
Yes.

566
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,880
And the ability to think strategically.

567
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,160
And what are the ingredients

568
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,720
for strategic thinking.

569
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,920
And you mentioned context.

570
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,260
That is a key ingredient.

571
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,680
A rigorous understanding of context

572
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,200
and then understanding how one

573
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,510
action creates another action -

574
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,760
Talk to me a little bit about this.

575
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,720
Talk to me about this little,

576
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,560
about this chess game of understanding.

577
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,070
Because throughout the course,

578
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,880
almost at every case study,

579
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,360
we understood in hindsight

580
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,560
that if we could just think

581
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,320
a little bit further ahead

582
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,080
and play this chess game internally

583
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,640
and realize

584
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,920
There were some instances where

585
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,880
we were amazed by how you

586
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,000
realized back then

587
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,720
in 1970 that one action

588
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,680
is gonna lead to another,

589
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,720
and you were able to save

590
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,520
six months of hardships

591
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,070
and hundreds of millions of dollars.

592
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,510
How can we possibly do that?

593
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,320
Sit down and try to imagine

594
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,400
what the possible scenarios are

595
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,750
so that we can avoid

596
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,200
the hardships already?

597
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,830
Yeah, I think one of the words

598
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,680
you just used is critical.

599
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,240
Imagine, you have to have

600
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:11,110
a flourishing and

601
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,160
thriving imaginary

602
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,310
imagination capability.

603
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:16,590
Right.

604
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,270
And that comes with test driving ideas.

605
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,120
It comes with

606
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,840
not letting the emperor walk around

607
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,830
with no clothes.

608
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,200
Right.

609
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,160
It comes with defining reality.

610
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,440
Looking at things with a critical eye.

611
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,070
You know, if you look at what's happened

612
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,160
today with this whole pandemic,

613
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,640
there was a lot of

614
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,640
a distinct lack of thinking ahead

615
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,440
and thinking about consequence

616
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,680
and the absence of defining what was reality.

617
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,000
All these mixed messages that have

618
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
come out for the last six months

619
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,200
have been incredibly destructive

620
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,510
to having a coherent strategy.

621
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,120
And so, I think that the idea of

622
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,480
really getting ingrained in your head

623
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,840
that everything you do

624
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,160
is gonna have a consequence,

625
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,800
and that consequence is

626
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,040
gonna have a consequence,

627
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,350
and so forth and so forth and so forth.

628
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,960
And the more you're able to take those steps,

629
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,680
the further you take those steps,

630
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,440
the more you're going to land

631
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,480
on the right landing zone

632
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,920
that is going to be the most positive.

633
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,680
Sure. And you know,

634
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,920
all these are leadership positions

635
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,560
that you have quite a few people

636
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:28,960
under you.

637
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,720
And a lot of these times

638
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,400
it sounds like

639
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,240
they're more crisis management

640
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,320
than they are just thinking

641
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,110
strategically. Right?

642
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,200
Because every time you're confronted

643
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,600
with a communications crisis or

644
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,920
a branding crisis,

645
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,920
you're the go to guy and says,

646
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,920
"David, please help us solve this.

647
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,790
This is your time to shine."

648
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,400
How do you go about doing that?

649
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,680
I mean, how is leading in a crisis

650
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,350
different than

651
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,160
leading when times are good

652
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,920
and you're just thinking about

653
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,350
the next nice project to do?

654
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,240
Well, you know,

655
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,840
as you heard me say in class,

656
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,600
the best crisis management is to avert

657
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,760
the crisis in the first place.

658
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,070
And so,

659
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,160
that means a lot of thinking about

660
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,760
where are the potential crises.

661
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,200
Right.

662
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,350
You know, they're all out there.

663
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,200
There are all these landmines out there,

664
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,590
and if you're able to identify them early,

665
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,000
you can navigate them

666
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,550
with more skill.

667
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,600
However, that doesn't mean to say

668
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,440
that you can avoid every crisis.

669
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,480
Right.

670
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,070
I think the important thing

671
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,880
in crisis management,

672
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,070
well there's several things.

673
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,760
One is something called

674
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,200
deliberate calmness.

675
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,840
You have to create an environment

676
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,960
for yourself that is deliberately calm

677
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,440
so that you can ask the right questions.

678
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:44,720
Right.

679
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,720
And a lot of times in a crisis,

680
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:51,400
you'll watch people run around

681
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,160
thinking that,

682
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,120
What are we gonna do?

683
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,760
What are we gonna do?

684
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,830
What are we gonna do?

685
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,280
And they haven't asked

686
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,720
the most important question,

687
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,080
which we said a lot in class,

688
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:00,480
which is,

689
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,920
Okay, what do we know?

690
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,400
What do we know about the circumstance?

691
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,280
And what do we need to know?

692
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,440
Exactly.

693
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,720
And so, if we ask the right questions

694
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,680
and we do so in a thoughtful, calm,

695
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,280
organized way,

696
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,520
you will not only be able to navigate

697
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,720
through the moment,

698
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,120
but you'll also be able to understand

699
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,240
what the ramifications are longer term.

700
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:33,400
McKinsey calls that integrative thinking.

701
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,440
The kind of thinking that you can

702
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,640
simultaneously think about

703
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,760
what you have to do in the moment

704
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,360
at the same time you're thinking

705
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,000
about the implications for the future.

706
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:47,240
And that's what we really needed

707
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,720
in this current environment

708
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,830
were people that could do that.

709
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,600
I think it's incredible.

710
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,360
I mean, every time we walked into class

711
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,760
and we received the case study

712
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,400
ahead of time and we were so

713
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,400
pumped we would discuss it for hours.

714
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,360
My good friend Santiago and I

715
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,640
before coming to class,

716
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,240
and we come in and all of a sudden you say,

717
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,070
"Okay, wait, wait, stop.

718
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,280
What do you know?

719
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,920
What do you need to know?"

720
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,440
And then we, and then

721
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,520
the second half was only

722
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,600
Okay, how can we now use this information

723
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,550
to process through this?

724
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,840
But it's not just jumping in

725
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,590
and with the first instinct, just acting.

726
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,280
Professor, you are looking at now

727
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,640
you know this global pandemic.

728
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:22,920
It was, at least to me,

729
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,000
very apparent in the tech community

730
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,480
that almost every company

731
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,720
and every institution decided

732
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,880
to deal with things differently.

733
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,760
Also in terms of universities.

734
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,000
You have universities that have,

735
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,560
that until today have not decided

736
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,200
on what's happening next year.

737
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,160
You have universities that

738
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,880
have already decided

739
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,480
that they're closed next year

740
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,000
for physical studies.

741
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And you have universities that

742
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,350
have already said they're open.

743
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,600
So, it sounds like globally

744
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,600
there's not really strategic strategy

745
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,200
for communicating with the public.

746
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,080
Of course, looking at governments,

747
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,480
it's very similar.

748
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,800
What's your take on this?

749
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,720
What does it take from a government

750
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,360
or an institution to power through

751
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,520
a crisis that we just don't know what it is?

752
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,000
We just don't know what the ending is.

753
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:08,120
Well, first of all, you have to communicate

754
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,830
coherently and consistently.

755
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,160
and that includes communicating

756
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,040
what you don't know.

757
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,070
Okay.

758
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,240
And I think that early on

759
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,480
there were a lot of leaders,

760
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,310
I won't get into too many specifics,

761
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,000
but there were a lot of leaders

762
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,840
who communicated about things

763
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,520
they knew nothing about.

764
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:28,830
Right.

765
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,960
And made assertions and comments

766
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,550
that were confusing to the public.

767
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,640
You had some leaders,

768
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,480
and I would say

769
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,310
some of the governors,

770
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,000
I think showed incredible

771
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,400
forthrightness and calm.

772
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,760
And I think somebody like

773
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,360
Governor Cuomo in New York.

774
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
Every day -

775
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,600
Very impressive. Yes.

776
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,280
briefing and saying

777
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,280
what they know, what don't know,

778
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,320
what are the practical steps,

779
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,310
what are the responsible steps.

780
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,240
He also was a moral leader

781
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,880
about what were people's responsibilities.

782
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,440
Yes.

783
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,680
And he practiced what he preached.

784
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,320
All of those things go into

785
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,720
having an ability to mobilize

786
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,080
not just public opinion,

787
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,280
but public action.

788
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,310
And so that people weren't

789
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,920
demonstrating in the streets.

790
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:33,720
They weren't resisting

791
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,520
what was calm

792
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,880
and deliberative leadership.

793
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,240
Definitely.

794
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,680
I mean, you look at New Zealand

795
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,720
just as another case study.
- Exactly

796
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,480
... see the prime minister

797
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,560
standing every day.

798
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,200
And I watched quite a few of those

799
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,960
because I was just inspired

800
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,000
every time she had a question

801
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,880
and then she looked to the doctor

802
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,280
on her right and said

803
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,960
"I don't know this.

804
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,760
Do you know this?"

805
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,640
Let's write it down.

806
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,320
Let's check on this

807
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,000
and we'll come back to you tomorrow."

808
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,960
And the next day she

809
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,070
would come back to it.

810
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,720
That's leadership to me.

811
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,960
The leadership taking ownership

812
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,520
of what you know,

813
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,320
what you don't know

814
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,800
and over communicating

815
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,920
not under communicating.

816
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,640
I talked to quite a few, through this show,

817
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,640
I talked to quite a few

818
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,600
CEOs of companies

819
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
both large and small

820
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,200
And one thing that

821
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,760
constantly came up

822
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,400
is this idea of always

823
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,640
overcommunicate.

824
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,680
Never under communicate,

825
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:20,440
especially in a time of crisis.

826
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,000
That trust that you're building,

827
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,680
and I think we talked about this

828
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,040
quite a bit about

829
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,790
in the context of branding.

830
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,200
It's you gain the trust

831
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,840
along the way

832
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,680
with the actions you do.

833
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,360
It's very easy to break the trust.

834
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,880
To do a single, right?

835
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,720
Yeah. Well, and you know,

836
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,000
the other thing is that

837
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,480
now more than ever,

838
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,320
given that communications

839
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,350
don't take place in a vacuum,

840
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,400
there is this communications environment

841
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,400
that we live in today

842
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,440
of social media

843
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:54,360
and highly partisan media

844
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,520
that is out there

845
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,920
fomenting misinformation,

846
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,120
disinformation.

847
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,800
Some of it's accurate information,

848
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,920
but how do you know?

849
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,400
How do you tell the difference?

850
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,520
Well, that's where you need

851
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,640
government leaders, corporate leaders

852
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,600
to be more thoughtful

853
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,920
so that they can command

854
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,720
the public's attention.

855
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,880
When they're sending mixed messages,

856
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,760
who does the public turn to

857
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,790
for an authoritative source?

858
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,200
There is no one.

859
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:24,790
Definitely. It's incredible.

860
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,240
Professor, right before we leave,

861
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,310
I wanna get your overall insight.

862
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,080
I'm looking at myself as

863
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,310
a young entrepreneur.

864
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,960
I am very excited to one day

865
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,080
start my company, hopefully

866
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,440
sooner rather than later.

867
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,040
I am even more excited to be

868
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,280
in one of your classes,

869
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,800
hopefully as a GSB student

870
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,160
myself one day.

871
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,800
But if you could give me one or two

872
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,720
key pieces of advice looking forward

873
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,680
from your enormous career

874
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,600
both in corporate

875
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,790
and the public service,

876
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,960
but also at Stanford

877
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,520
which you ran communications

878
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,880
which I didn't even mention.

879
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:57,550
What should I take with me

880
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,880
over my next few decades as

881
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,640
I aim to be a leader myself?

882
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,760
I think about three things.

883
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,350
And, you know, I think best in three's

884
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,840
One is always find your colleagues,

885
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:16,480
people that you're working with,

886
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,960
that are worthy of respect.

887
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,550
You want to work with people

888
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,680
that you respect.

889
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,200
Right.

890
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,280
Second, always find something

891
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,320
that allows you to grow

892
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,880
Intellectually, perhaps financially,

893
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,550
but most importantly,

894
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,640
that is going to drive

895
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,080
your intellectual curiosity

896
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,280
and keep it vibrant and thriving.

897
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,960
And finally,

898
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,640
knowing you as I do,

899
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,590
I think I would say

900
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,240
always make sure you're involved

901
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,110
in something beyond yourself.

902
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,160
So that it's bigger than you.

903
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:53,400
And that will, I think, give your life

904
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,320
and your career

905
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,240
that much more purpose.

906
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,600
I love it.

907
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,960
And definitely, I think having this

908
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,960
one on one here

909
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,960
and everything that I've

910
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,480
learned from you and

911
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,880
I wanna thank you again

912
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,080
for the incredible, incredible course

913
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,720
that you taught us

914
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,830
and for all the inspiration.

915
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,000
I think that it's one thing as a class

916
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,120
to come in and show you

917
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,040
that we're learning

918
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,520
and that we're progressing

919
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,440
and we are enjoying it.

920
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,200
But I have to tell you that outside

921
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,070
of the classroom,

922
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,880
the number of meaningful discussions

923
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,360
we've had and the thoughts we shared

924
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,590
on how inspiring this was,

925
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,520
it really, I think,

926
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,760
changed a lot of our thinking

927
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,680
in the context of what it means to be

928
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,040
a person who thinks strategically,

929
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,360
a person who looks at a problem,

930
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,200
and understands that it's bigger

931
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,160
than just the hundred words

932
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
written on the page.

933
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,920
Context is everything.

934
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,400
It's all about what we don't know

935
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,560
as much as we what we know

936
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,720
and what do we need to know

937
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,240
in order to feel comfortable

938
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,070
solving the puzzle.

939
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,310
So, thank you very much.

940
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,280
Right before we leave.

941
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:54,720
Three words that best describe you.

942
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,600
Optimistic.

943
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,310
Principled.

944
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,560
Yeah.

945
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:10,280
And determined.

946
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,350
I love it.

947
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,200
Professor Demarest,

948
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,600
thank you very, very much.

949
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,720
Enjoy your time in Florida.

950
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,280
Enjoy your time with your family,

951
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,400
and I look forward to seeing you

952
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:20,840
on campus one day in person.

953
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,040
You take care, Michael.

954
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,440
Take care.

955
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,240
Thank you for the time.
