00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,720
Eran Sandhaus, thank you for joining me

2
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,680
on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,040
Thank you for having me, Michael.

4
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,880
I am so excited. So excited

5
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,560
because I'm gonna get

6
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,680
so much inspiration now

7
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,320
about mobility,

8
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,760
about your experience as an entrepreneur,

9
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,560
as a board member and advisor,

10
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,640
but most importantly

11
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,800
about where we're headed

12
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,840
as a community of innovators

13
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,240
past covid-19.

14
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,680
Eran, let's just start.

15
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,560
Who are you?

16
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,760
Besides the fact that I know you

17
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,560
from J-Ventures

18
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,040
and all the fun that we have there,

19
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,960
who are you?

20
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,320
Wow.

21
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,160
What a big question, Michael.

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,760
Well, let me try to summarize it

23
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,280
maybe in a few words.

24
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,200
So, what I'm really passionate about,

25
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,880
I would say, is the human spirit.

26
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,320
Okay.

27
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,200
Who I am is, I like to,

28
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,840
first of all I really love technology.

29
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,960
I believe in technology,

30
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,760
and I'm someone that

31
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,920
likes to make things happen

32
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,400
in ways that are highly accelerated,

33
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,480
which is why technology

34
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,440
is important for me.

35
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,000
And the other thing

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,915
that I really care about is people.

37
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,280
Okay and social change and social impact.
So if you kind of look at who I am

38
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,960
I would say that I'm the combination of two of those things.

39
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,520
Okay. That's at a very high level.

40
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,160
Let me share with you

41
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,440
the rest of my journey.

42
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,600
Okay. So you started out in semiconductors

43
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,160
and in Texas Instruments and Qualcomm,

44
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,000
you find your way more

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,440
to an entrepreneurial position

46
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,720
and very excited about mobility.

47
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,400
What is it about

48
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,760
the entrepreneurial mindset and mobility

49
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,000
that really got you excited?

50
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah. So, as you said,

51
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,040
I started my career in semiconductors

52
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,880
and I ended up almost by mistake

53
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,680
getting into mobility.

54
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,960
So, the common denominator in my career

55
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,240
in the semiconductor space is that

56
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,560
the early years were engineering,

57
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,440
but the last decade

58
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,400
I've managed all the businesses.

59
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,720
And all of them were about

60
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,880
creating a startup inside

61
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,400
the large multinational.

62
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,160
I was the crazy Israeli guy that said,

63
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,520
"Okay. Bring this guy,

64
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,760
so he can make this vision.

65
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,240
So, how can we grow the company?

66
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,280
How can we create this new business?"

67
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,040
So I would come in and kind of I parachute in.

68
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,240
Get the lay of the land,

69
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,520
recruit the team, start to grow.

70
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,040
And I've done this for a very long time

71
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,360
because I really enjoyed the scale

72
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,480
and the breadth of what you can do

73
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,680
at the global scale

74
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,960
with a large multinational.

75
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,680
And that gave me a great career

76
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,480
for quite some time, about 18 years.

77
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:23,440
But two and a half years ago, I actually,

78
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,760
So, this was about 15 years of my career.

79
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,120
And right after that,

80
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,880
what happened is

81
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,080
I got recruited to move into mobility.

82
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,640
So Delphi Automotive were looking

83
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,120
for someone to lead their autonomous

84
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,000
vehicle business.

85
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,680
I met with the CEO

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,160
and we really hit it off

87
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,440
with a great chemistry.

88
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,280
And I asked him one question,

89
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,160
"Why are you interested to hire someone like me"

90
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,440
'cause I'm not from your business.

91
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,000
I came from semi."

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And he said, "It's very simple.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,320
I look for someone who's,

94
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,240
in the automotive world

95
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,800
we're very conservative.

96
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,680
We think about safety.

97
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,000
I want someone with a mindset

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,040
of making things happen

99
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
and has no fear."

100
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,680
Okay -

101
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,880
Now, when is this?

102
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Around when are we?

103
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,000
This was the end of 2016.

104
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,800
2016. Okay.

105
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,440
So, right at the end of 2016.

106
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,560
And I came out of the room.

107
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,680
I got a call from the recruiter

108
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,240
an hour later that said they want me.

109
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,560
And because fundamentally,

110
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,960
they figured out that

111
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,880
if you would have me on board,

112
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,320
I can help create a business,

113
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,200
which again, most people

114
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,840
totally think would be crazy to create.

115
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,240
And I took the job

116
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,440
and I fell in love with that mission.

117
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,360
You know, when you think about

118
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,320
self-driving cars,

119
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,840
the promise behind it,

120
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,880
as I said, I really care about

121
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,200
the social impact as well.

122
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,320
You know, it started

123
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,080
with reducing the casualties.

124
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,640
There's over one million people

125
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,760
dying every single day,

126
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,280
40,000 in the US

127
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,840
Sorry every single year.

128
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,600
Yeah.

129
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,840
And 40,000 people in the US alone,

130
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,440
normally not with Corona -

131
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,800
Every single year.

132
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,280
40,000 people -

133
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,400
Every single year 40,000 people

134
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,160
in the US die from accidents.

135
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,200
It's literally like a 747

136
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,880
going down every day.

137
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,840
Okay. So, this is a major, major thing.

138
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,560
And by the way,

139
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,760
most of the one million people

140
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,840
are coming from Asia.

141
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,200
Of course, there's more people living there,

142
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,760
but there's a lot to be done.

143
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,920
So, you know what?

144
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,320
It was very compelling for me

145
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,560
and for the team that they built was

146
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,600
how can we go and literally save lives?

147
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,320
And the second piece that is really

148
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,000
appealing about mobility

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,160
it's about reducing the cost of travel.

150
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,280
Okay the cost of movement.

151
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,080
And if you think about

152
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,200
what it is movement,

153
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,400
it's enabling people

154
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,680
that are outside of the cities,

155
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,720
that are living far away,

156
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,800
that don't have access.

157
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,480
All of a sudden,

158
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,880
it becomes affordable for them

159
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,480
to connect to the city to get employment.

160
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,680
Okay. So, this is something

161
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,080
that could literally reshape

162
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,920
what it is to have like a city,

163
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,120
what it is to live in a suburb,

164
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,280
what it is to be outside.

165
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,720
All of a sudden you get connected.

166
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,520
Right.

167
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,320
It also ... the time to be productive

168
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,720
the time that you travel.

169
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,400
So, I'd love to get your insight into

170
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,880
because you're an expert in the industry,

171
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,280
and you're an advisor and board member

172
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,800
of a bunch of these companies

173
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,440
that are making groundbreaking work

174
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,080
in mobility and autonomous vehicles.

175
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,680
Yet here we are in 2020.

176
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,400
We've been hearing about this

177
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,480
notion of autonomous vehicles,

178
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,280
autonomous mobility for quite some time.

179
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,480
I've talked to quite a few people

180
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,920
in a variety of these

181
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:12,400
edge technology companies,

182
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,240
and it seems like we're

183
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,640
at the 95% stage.

184
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,200
And that extra five percent

185
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,680
is very, very difficult

186
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,640
and we're not gonna get it on the road

187
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,880
until we get that five percent.

188
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,600
Is that the case?

189
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,440
What's happening today?

190
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,600
Sure. So, I don't think we're at the 95%.

191
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,920
We're at the 80% stage.

192
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,800
So, there's a lot more to be done.

193
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,960
I'm really bummed out right now.

194
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,840
I was very optimistic coming in here.

195
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,480
But let me tell you,

196
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,080
when I was recruited

197
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:36,840
into Delphi,

198
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,000
we believe that by 2020 or 2022,

199
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,560
there'll be self-driving cars everywhere,

200
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,640
ubiquitous.

201
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,300
Not only you.

202
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,560
A lot of people thought that.

203
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,680
Right. And a short while after I came in,

204
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,280
I realized that that's not gonna happen.

205
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,040
There was a lot of stuff

206
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,000
that has to be resolved.

207
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,440
However, when you think about it,

208
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,720
it's probably it's not gonna happen

209
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,960
the way that people wanted,

210
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,920
but it is gonna happen

211
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,600
a different way.

212
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,840
And it is gonna go sooner

213
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,200
than people think now.

214
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,080
And what I mean by that is

215
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,040
originally people thought that

216
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,280
their using Uber and Lyft,

217
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,760
it's gonna go self-driving car.

218
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,480
That's it. Okay, 2022, a very high percentage.

219
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,200
That's not the case.

220
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,880
However, you can now take the same set

221
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,520
of capabilities that have been developed

222
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,160
for that market

223
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,400
and apply them in other places

224
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,480
that are very profitable,

225
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,960
lucrative and very relevant.

226
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
So, for example, one of them is trucking.

227
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,360
Okay.

228
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,800
When you start to think about it,

229
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,040
there are already businesses

230
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,280
with built business models

231
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,040
that you can start to automate

232
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,920
and make money today.

233
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,760
They're very relevant.

234
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,120
So trucking is an industry

235
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,680
that there's a shortage of drivers.

236
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,080
There's a lot of things that you can do

237
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,520
once you start to move to

238
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,920
self-driving trucks. You can do deliveries at night.

239
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,280
Also some things that would really

240
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,280
alleviate a lot of network.

241
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,160
And the other thing, by the way that sprung,

242
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,160
a lot of people started to pivot away

243
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,920
from doing the self-driving taxis

244
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
to delivery robots.

245
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,720
In the last two to three years

246
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,000
and now you can start to see

247
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,640
pilots already going on

248
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,320
with Postmates, for example,

249
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,600
both in LA and San Francisco,

250
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,760
they moved to deliveries

251
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,120
with driverless robots.

252
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,480
And you can see also in downtown

253
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,640
Mountain View ... doing that.

254
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,440
Wow.

255
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,880
So that trend is gonna start

256
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,280
to look different than what we thought,

257
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,640
but it is coming sooner.

258
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,320
Personally,

259
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,880
I'm also working with the world's

260
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,280
largest public transportation company.

261
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,960
And they're also working publicly

262
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,240
on the project now for 50 pilots,

263
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,520
five zero pilots globally

264
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,280
for self-driving shuttles

265
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,400
in different location.

266
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,800
Amazing.

267
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,200
The point of what I'm trying to say

268
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,520
is if you start to narrow down

269
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,280
what it is that you do,

270
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,680
this problem starts to be manageable.

271
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,400
And that's what people are doing now.

272
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,720
So was the problem that

273
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,560
five, 10 years ago,

274
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,640
people were making these

275
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,480
huge remarks

276
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,160
and huge aspirations of

277
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,360
every car in the world

278
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,880
is gonna be autonomous.

279
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,520
And now we're just narrowing it down

280
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,280
into manageable pieces?

281
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,480
Is this the transition that we're seeing?

282
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,240
Yeah. What happened is

283
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,640
a natural process in the market

284
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,000
of like a shakeout

285
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,080
for product market fit.

286
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,640
So by and large the product,

287
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,520
the companies went to

288
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,400
minimum viable products.

289
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,320
Most companies

290
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,360
pivoted to where the money is at.

291
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,320
And therefore we started to see things

292
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,040
going into agriculture.

293
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,920
Mining is also going up.

294
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,280
Construction.

295
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,440
... operations

296
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:11,840
that they're going

297
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,240
to inside of warehouses

298
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,720
for e-commerce is booming.

299
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,480
All of that started

300
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,320
to really grow rapidly.

301
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,480
And you still have companies

302
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,960
that are doing robotaxis.

303
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,800
So, Mobilize working on it.

304
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,560
You've got Zoot that's

305
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,480
been required by Amazon. And Aurora

306
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,000
So there are a bunch of companies,

307
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,080
but they're gonna take longer.

308
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,200
So, it's just been separated from this

309
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,800
huge monolithic thing that we're gonna

310
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,760
see 100% to this spectrum

311
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,880
of things that are out there.

312
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,360
I love it.

313
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,640
Eran, what's happening now?

314
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,280
You know, we're in the midst of covid-19,

315
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,400
we all hope that it would end

316
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,640
just as fast as it came.

317
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,640
It's not gonna end anytime soon.

318
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,280
We're experiencing all these new realities.

319
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,400
I'm fascinated every day thinking about

320
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,320
how our world is changing

321
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,600
and the workforce is changing.

322
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,280
And I know that I'm going

323
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,680
to build my own venture

324
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,160
sooner rather than later.

325
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,680
And I'm constantly thinking about

326
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,360
what is my role coming out of

327
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,280
or being a part of covid-19.

328
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,360
You wrote a fascinating piece on Medium

329
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,480
about our role as innovators

330
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,120
through covid-19.

331
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,680
What's your mindset about this?

332
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,680
What is our collective responsibility

333
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,000
as entrepreneurs and innovators?

334
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,480
Right. So, thank you for mentioning that.

335
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,120
The main point that I made in that article

336
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,600
When I look back at the crisis

337
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,120
that I experienced in 2000 and 2008,

338
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,680
those years were extremely difficult

339
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,200
and challenging in many ways.

340
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,920
But on the other end,

341
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,160
it really forced me to reckon with,

342
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,160
Okay what can I do to stay on top

343
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,840
and to innovate?

344
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,120
And to really have a profitable business.

345
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,920
So, talk to me
What happened in 2008?

346
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,720
Because that's also a really cool story.

347
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,920
Sure. So, in 2008,

348
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,440
I was working for Texas Instruments

349
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,320
for TI and we're selling chips

350
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,480
to cellphone companies.

351
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,040
And we had a really good business.

352
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,720
With a very good and diverse business,

353
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
but as you can imagine

354
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,560
when there's a crisis,

355
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,120
everything goes down.

356
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,160
So, in a short period of time,

357
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,040
our revenue went down

358
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,960
to pretty much to zero.

359
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,560
And we had hundreds of employees

360
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,720
on our payroll globally.

361
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,280
So, it was a very scary time

362
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,840
I would say as a person

363
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,240
that is managing this group,

364
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,680
we had to go through layoffs.

365
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,600
It was very difficult as well.

366
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,960
But we knew that it was not

367
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,160
gonna be the end.

368
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,960
And since I also had a strategy team

369
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,080
under my command, I said,

370
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,820
"Okay, let's go figure out.

371
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,480
Let's get in the room, okay.

372
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
And while we go through all this

373
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,280
very difficult period,

374
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,760
let's think about what we can create.

375
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,600
What we can envision"

376
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,080
And we decided to go outside of our

377
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,960
four corners and we invited speakers.

378
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,240
We brought speakers who are

379
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,760
like forward thinkers

380
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,640
and everything, researchers.

381
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,080
And we sat together and we came upon,

382
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,400
one of them started to mention

383
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,080
this whole notion on

384
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,200
machine to machine.

385
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,280
Okay. That one day machines

386
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,240
will start to be connected

387
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,640
and communicate with each other.

388
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:41,960
And you know,

389
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
it really sprung our imagination

390
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,320
because if we created these

391
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,840
wireless chips that you put in a phone,

392
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,160
what if you could actually take

393
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,320
the same devices

394
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,360
and that $100 million investment

395
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,200
that we do every year

396
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,960
to generate these devices

397
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,160
and now start to put it in everything.

398
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,440
So think about thermostats,

399
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,200
doorbells, security cameras.

400
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,640
You know, these are just -

401
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,680
I mean, today it sounds like a default.

402
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,320
Of course everything is connected.

403
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,960
But back then, in 2008,

404
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,360
in the middle of

405
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,320
a great economic recession.

406
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,640
Not as default. Right.

407
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,320
So, it did not exist.

408
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,520
What it causes, it kind of

409
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,720
reckon us to think about okay

410
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,400
what if we could do something different?

411
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,000
And we literally inside of this

412
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,760
entire huge issue,

413
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,320
we recruited a team,

414
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,440
a business team, first to go after

415
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,880
chasing all these people out there

416
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,720
to find out what's out there.

417
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,560
Kind of like sending the dove

418
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,720
in the middle of the flood.

419
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,880
And they went out and they

420
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,160
came back with an analysis.

421
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,360
Okay here's a market that we can do.

422
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,400
There's another one.

423
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,560
We should go after automotive

424
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,520
and everyone all of a sudden, first of all,

425
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,880
there was a whole burst of energy.

426
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,000
So, in the midst of that crisis,

427
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,960
we all started to get really

428
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,000
excited by that vision.

429
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,560
And 12 months later,

430
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,240
we had a business unit in place.

431
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,160
We started to allocate

432
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,760
engineering resources.

433
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,680
That was 2008 marked the beginning

434
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,120
of how we brought Internet of things

435
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,920
into Texas Instruments.

436
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,840
We ended up engaging with

437
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,240
with some of the top guys

438
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,960
between Google and Apple

439
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,760
and all these guys,

440
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,080
because no one would start

441
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,920
to brainstorm with them about the stakes.

442
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,040
So, it was actually one of the most

443
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,760
productive eras that we had that.

444
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,440
A decade later that business

445
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,520
became a booming business

446
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,600
and so did the company.

447
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,200
It started at that point.

448
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,600
So, my takeaway as an entrepreneur here is

449
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,680
you have a huge crisis on your hand.

450
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,040
Your current business is shut down

451
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,640
and you're almost forced

452
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,240
to make a decision.

453
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,000
You either sit down and wait

454
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,680
and moan in dismay,

455
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,840
or you can say,

456
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,440
"Okay well let's take this time

457
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,600
to understand the world better.

458
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,400
Pivot if necessary and discover things that

459
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,040
we might not have been able to see otherwise

460
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,840
because we never allocated the energy

461
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,600
and the mindfulness to be exposed to them"

462
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Right. That's exactly the point.

463
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,000
You never wanna lose the opportunity

464
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,360
to address a good crisis.

465
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,920
That was something that was said by

466
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,567
one of the Obama advisors.

467
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,720
Right awhile back.

468
00:14:53,723 --> 00:14:54,960
Never waste a good crisis.

469
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,920
Never waste a good crisis.

470
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,360
So when you think about it,

471
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,160
that was the point of the article I made,

472
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,040
which is, When I look back in 2030,

473
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,960
okay, that's the challenge

474
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,640
I gave to everyone

475
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,600
at the end of the article.

476
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,160
Yes.

477
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,640
When I look back at 2030,

478
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,840
what is it that we'll be doing

479
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,600
now in 2020 that I'll be proud of?

480
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,000
And what is it that you'll be doing now

481
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,200
that you can look back and say,

482
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,560
"Oh, my God. That was something

483
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,360
that I created in this period of time"

484
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,920
100%. 100%.

485
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,280
So Eran, one of the things that

486
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,880
I've got to know you over these past few months

487
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,160
through J-Ventures is your kindness

488
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,800
and your motivation

489
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,320
to have social impact and social good.

490
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,880
What does that mean

491
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,120
to have social impact,

492
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,520
especially you know in our world

493
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,280
when it's very capitalistic

494
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,040
and we're constantly chasing our next goals

495
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
and our next titles and positions?

496
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,720
What is our responsibility also

497
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,560
for social impact?

498
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,320
Well, I don't know

499
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,440
what's our responsibility,

500
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,200
but I'll share with you

501
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,240
where I'm at in this journey, okay?

502
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,560
You know, a few weeks ago, actually,

503
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,400
I was very fortunate to attend a session

504
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,560
that Oded organized with Sir Ronald Cohen.

505
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,640
I think it was about four or five weeks ago.

506
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,440
And he spoke about social impact.

507
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,600
And it really struck a chord with me.

508
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,160
So I'm in this journey right now

509
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,000
to really figure out

510
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,040
what could be done with this.

511
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,040
And what was interesting

512
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,080
about this combination is

513
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,240
for the first time in my life,

514
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,600
I figured out that the two worlds

515
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,240
of social impact and entrepreneurship

516
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,880
and financial impact can actually be

517
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:19,600
joined together into something.

518
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,000
What made it truly interesting

519
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,360
in the talk with Ronald Cohen

520
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,960
was that he was talking about

521
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,760
what's really missing

522
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,200
in the world of capitalism today

523
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,480
and the way that corporations are acting

524
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,360
is that they're not measured in any way

525
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,080
shape or form, really,

526
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,040
on the social impact.

527
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,040
Some of them they issue reports and stuff,

528
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,320
but in reality they really measure

529
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,960
their financial impact.

530
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,040
And in the process,

531
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,120
they can cause a lot of harm

532
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,240
No one looks.

533
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,920
Now, what if that was not the case.

534
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,240
What if there was a scale literally

535
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,160
that you could measure

536
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,680
and quantify dollar wise

537
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,520
the social impact of a company?

538
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,040
That's a fascinating concept.

539
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,240
If you do that, you eventually start

540
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,520
to transform the playing field.

541
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,280
So, that's it.

542
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,880
That's in the realm of large companies

543
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,520
and the same thing

544
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,800
applies for investment.

545
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,040
Like what if we could literally

546
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,000
deploy capital

547
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,560
not only to invest in companies

548
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,000
that would be

549
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,800
extremely financially successful,

550
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,270
but in the process,

551
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,750
with great, amazing social returns.

552
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,400
And I think that that world

553
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,440
is really fascinating.

554
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,480
What I was not aware is that there's

555
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,960
multiple trillions of dollars that are

556
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,720
already operating in the space,

557
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,640
Like BlackRock and

558
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,920
... already put money

559
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,400
and there are already some VC firms.

560
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,880
So, for me, when I'm thinking about 2030,

561
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,440
I wanna be able to look back and say,

562
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,120
"Okay, I've created a dent

563
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,200
inside of that trend"

564
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,830
because there's something

565
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,680
that's for me personally,

566
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,880
I think it's very directionally correct.

567
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,320
Of course. So, as I'm starting my journey

568
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,280
as a young entrepreneur

569
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,080
and a lot of my friends from Stanford

570
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,600
and 8200 who are joining me

571
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,880
on this journey now,

572
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,440
what are some things with your experience

573
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,720
that we can take with us

574
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,640
as we're both looking to make a dent

575
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,960
financially and make innovation

576
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,240
and make a dent physically in the world,

577
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,080
but also with social impact in mind.

578
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,520
Because it still seems like there's a pretty

579
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,760
big dissonance between the effort

580
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,040
that we put into social impact

581
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,920
and the effort that we put

582
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,510
in to make a successful business.

583
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,640
They seem very separated.

584
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,240
And I'd love to learn for myself

585
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,680
how I can start combining them?

586
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,960
Yeah, I think the key element

587
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,440
is really to create a business

588
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,760
that the core business is the one

589
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,680
that creates the social wealth.

590
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,760
So, it's not like something

591
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,590
that is on the side.

592
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,400
It's not something that

593
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,270
comes in contradiction.

594
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,760
And there are businesses

595
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,960
that are 100% social.

596
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,510
Those are basically in the philanthropy realm.

597
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,720
There are businesses that are 100% business

598
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,000
and there's no social aspects.

599
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,800
The interesting part is,

600
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
can you create a business

601
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,830
that is 100% aligned

602
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,800
so whenever you grow

603
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,160
and you sell another unit,

604
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,790
you literally start to expand more.

605
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,830
Definitely.

606
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,070
And that's the way to think about it.

607
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,240
And the other aspect which is

608
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,550
critical for social impact.

609
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,440
It's not enough to have a declaration

610
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,200
to have social good,

611
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,800
but it's literally taking on and measuring it

612
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,830
and setting goals.

613
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,790
Which is very counter intuitive.

614
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,270
This idea of measuring your social impact,

615
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,000
not just saying

616
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,320
we are a socially conscious company,

617
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,070
but actually quantifying

618
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,030
how much social impact are we doing.

619
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,900
I mean, it sounds like

620
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,270
a whole different thing that

621
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,720
I don't think it's being taught today

622
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,240
in business schools around the world.

623
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,560
It sounds like what you're saying is that

624
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,840
this is something that should be taught

625
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,200
and that should be addressed.

626
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,440
Yeah, I personally think that's the case.

627
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,200
In general, I believe that,

628
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,360
whatever you cannot measure

629
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,480
you cannot manage.

630
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,640
Okay first of all.

631
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,520
And if you don't set a goal in the future,

632
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,240
it doesn't shape your

633
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,880
actions in the present.

634
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,590
Okay. So, think about it.

635
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,160
Any company that you talk to

636
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,640
comes with a declaration of

637
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,120
what their financial future will look like

638
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,480
in the form of their forecast.

639
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,960
If you start to literally think that way

640
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,040
that you're gonna measure

641
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,640
and put the social impact out there

642
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,400
and measure it backwards,

643
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,480
that's gonna shape your action.

644
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,240
And that's the biggest thing

645
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,830
that I will tell you.

646
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,480
Don't just settle and work for a company

647
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,790
that says we're gonna do good.

648
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,280
Because every startup that I see

649
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,040
says we're gonna do good.

650
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,320
No startup says

651
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,720
we're gonna destroy the planet

652
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,750
or abuse our employees.

653
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,680
Everyone says they do good.

654
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,790
But it's a completely different,

655
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,840
... to say not only are

656
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,560
we gonna do good,

657
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,240
but we're gonna measure it.

658
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,790
Okay and we're gonna publish it.

659
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,320
And we're gonna seek out investors

660
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,240
that want that.

661
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,400
By the way, if you do that

662
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,680
it will create the right culture

663
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,440
in the company

664
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,160
It will attract the right set of people.

665
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,080
You get the right set of board members

666
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,680
and advisors.

667
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,120
People that really wanna be there

668
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,360
because they really want the mission

669
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,000
to succeed in

670
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:16,680
a completely different level.

671
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,800
I love it.

672
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,400
Eran, we started with mobility

673
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,720
I'd love to end with mobility

674
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,880
from an aspect of

675
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,240
You've had the privilege of sitting

676
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,800
on a number of advisory seats

677
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,760
and board seats of a variety of companies

678
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,480
who are dealing with mobility.

679
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,760
And I'd love to get your take quickly

680
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,240
on this idea of not just mobility,

681
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,400
but working in an industry that is

682
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,200
constantly developing, that is really

683
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,920
moving the needle in the world.

684
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,750
What are some of your earned secrets

685
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,550
spending these past few years

686
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,160
really understanding this industry

687
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,640
and seeing all the different players

688
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,830
play a part in it?

689
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,200
Yeah, I think the biggest one is really

690
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,840
spending the time

691
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,550
to understand the pain points.

692
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,240
Okay, so there's a reason why I work

693
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,000
within companies

694
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,440
because I like to understand

695
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,600
where are the intersection points

696
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,280
between them and where are the seams?

697
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,160
Where things are actually not working.

698
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,200
So, that's a whole different animal

699
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,310
to have a conversation

700
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,040
But what I can tell you is that

701
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,680
the main value is not just understanding

702
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,040
what works well,

703
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,440
but mainly understanding what are

704
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,920
the challenges and what doesn't.

705
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,440
That's what's gonna set

706
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,830
the different blocks of the ecosystem,

707
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,000
how people collaborate,

708
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:16,760
the business models,

709
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,350
the value chain. All of that

710
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,040
I love it. Eran, right before we finish,

711
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,590
I have to ask the most important question.

712
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,240
I need three words that you would use

713
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,200
to describe yourself

714
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,080
or that Oded would use to describe you

715
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,400
or anybody that worked with you

716
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,240
would use to describe you.

717
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,400
Yeah. I would say passionate.

718
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,880
Socially aware or social impact

719
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,590
would be a good one.

720
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,480
And the other one I would say innovator.

721
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:39,920
I love it.

722
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,480
It's so not surprising that almost

723
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,920
every person I have this show with

724
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,240
says passionate.

725
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,360
It makes me passionate definitely.

726
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,270
Eran, toda raba.

727
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,680
Thank you very much.

728
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,200
And best of luck with everything.

729
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,480
I can't wait to see these things on the street

730
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,040
and seeing the world actually change.

731
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,520
And I promise here and I'm gonna look back

732
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,440
at this conversation in 2030

733
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,480
to think about social impact

734
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,840
in a more quantitative way.

735
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,600
And I agree that that's the way to look.

736
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,160
I think it's beautiful that every person

737
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:08,880
would love to say,

738
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,640
"Yeah, I'm doing good for the world

739
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,440
and my company is doing good for the world."

740
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,240
I'm taking from this conversation

741
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,280
I wanna find a way to quantify this.

742
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,830
When soon I'm gonna start my own venture.

743
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,790
So, thank you for that inspiration.

744
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,440
Thank you, Michael.

745
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,680
Let's create the future.

746
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,520
Okay, thanks.

747
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,000
Take care.
