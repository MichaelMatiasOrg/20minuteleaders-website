1 Zack Bodner, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. It’s my pleasure. Thank you for inviting me, Michael. You know, when I look at you, I think of the person that’s allowing me to get Israeli entertainment in Palo Alto because before corona times, I would come almost weekly to the JCC for the weekly Israeli artist. I know that I may be experiencing the JCC different than a lot of other people around the community, but that’s you gave me such a great gift. So, first of all, thank you. It’s really great. It’s my pleasure. And I’m glad you’re taking advantage of all of the opportunities we’re offering, or at least one of the many opportunities we’re offering. And in this time of lockdown, we’re doing virtual OFJCC and the Israeli stuff that’s happening on Facebook Live is phenomenal. So, I hope you’re taking advantage of that as well. - A hundred percent. - There’s a lot of other stuff you could be doing as well, Michael. And when we open up, hopefully, sometime soon, I’m happy to share with you what those are as well. I would love that. Zack, you’ve been involved on the intersection of Israel-America Judaism for so long, but actually you started off by playing varsity soccer in Yale. Is that correct? [laughs] Yes. I don’t know if that’s where I started, but I definitely started at a certain point there. Yes, I did. I went to Yale to get the great education that Yale offers and to play soccer. I was recruited to play soccer there. I played goalie and it was an incredible experience. I actually took a little bit of a break. I went and studied at Hebrew University in Jerusalem for one semester, my junior year at the Rockford School. And while I was there, I actually played with Hapoel Jerusalem so played a little bit of ball with them as well - Wait wait you played professionally with Hapoel Jerusalem? Not officially 'cause I was playing NCAA ball. NCAA is the National Collegiate Athletic Association. So when you're playing - Actually, my girlfriend at Stanford just won the national championship this year as a striker. - Hey, mazel tov! Mazel tov Great. [laughs] But, so I trained with them. I trained with Hapoel, I didn't play officially with them, but it was a great experience. That’s what changed my life the time in Israel, I met the woman who I ended up marrying - Wow! ... became my wife and made the best friends of my life. I came back and I realized this is what I wanted to do with my life, something related to Israel and the Jewish people. So, here I am. - What did you study at Yale? I studied psychology and I focused on psychology of religion. I’ve always been a seeker. I’ve always been kind of a Jew in the wilderness, right Looking for the answers. And so, this was kind of like, "Why do people ask these big life questions?" And I thought, "Why does the dog howl at the moon?" These are the sorts of questions that I was always asking that led me to ultimately do graduate school work in philosophy of religion and theology, which is highly marketable, let me tell you. What you’re doing with GSB is gonna get you a much better job out of graduate school than what I did with a graduate degree in theology, Michael. Amazing. I definitely GSB is definitely in my radar right now. I’m still in the undergrad, but I love that I love people think that I’m in the GSB. So right now it’s planting seeds in my mind that I know I can get there, and I’ll get there one day. Exactly. Exactly. I think it’s your maturity having spent time in the army. You’re older than most of the young students at Stanford, I think. I hope to get there one day. And I just love it. I am trying to take a bunch of GSB courses because it’s just the building next door but that’s for another topic. Zack, I want to talk for a second about Judaism 4.0. You had a great TEDx talk that you gave about it and I love the very first sentence that you said. You said Judaism is a lot of things, but at the same time, it’s none of those things. So, please give me a little bit of insight into what is this Judaism 4.0. Yeah, right. Well, Judaism is it’s a religion. It’s not a religion. It’s a people. It’s not a people. It’s an ethnicity. It’s not an ethnicity. It’s a moral code. It’s a culture, right. It’s all of the above and none of the above. It’s 3,000 years old, and yet, people are still confused by what Judaism is. And that’s because it's evolved over time. And I talk about 4.0, Michael, because I believe we’re in the fourth era of Judaism. The first era was the era of the Mishkan where we were wandering in the desert and our portable holiness went with us. 2.0, we settled in Israel, the Holy Land. We built the temple. It was destroyed. Built the next temple. It was destroyed. But that period of centrality, our spirituality had a home. And then, destroyed 70 CE. You know the story and ever since then, we’ve been in the 3.0 era, which is the dispersion - - Right. - the exile, right. But what’s happening, and ever since kind of the enlightenment, is Judaism has started to realize that it can also be a part of secular society too, right. And this is what's confused people about is it a religion or is it not a religion? How can you convert out, and yet, how can the Nazis still say, “Well, you’re Jewish" even if you converted? Does it mean there’s a blood issue, there’s ethnicity? Well, now, we know Jews can also be Asian. They can be African-American. They can be Latino, right It’s not just about Yiddish. as we think about. There's Sephardi Jews. I married a nice Sephardi girl. I like that. [laughs] Yeah. So, we’re now in this moment of 4.0. We’re on the cusp. And it’s a lot of different factors that are contributing to this moment, but it’s creating a sociological crash. Right? Our whole outlook has been flipped on its head. So, we have to ask ourselves, what is the Judaism of the future going to look like? So, our job, our vision at the JCC here in Palo Alto is to be the architects of the Jewish future. We consider ourselves to be the ones helping people think about how can they do Jewish their way. So, Michael, you came and you connected to your Israeli-ness here at the JCC, right And so, one of the things we’re saying is: "How do the Israelis bring their version of Judaism here to American-Jews and how can we as American-Jews export that to Israel?" That’s one of things we need to think about, right? Because a lot of Israelis, as you probably know, think that you’re either secular or you’re orthodox and don't recognize there's a lot in between, right. In America, Judaism has this whole Mosaic in between Haredi or Khiloni - Yeah. - Right? But if Israelis can see that here and bring that back So, I’ll give you an example. Right - Please. Some Israelis, shlichim, who come here experience American Judaism, they saw what a reform Jewish synagogue, a Friday night service could be like. And they went back, and they brought that to the Namal in Tel-Aviv, on the port. And now you go on a Friday night Yes there's this beautiful service, right Mixed men and women, and singing and Israelis are like, "... What is this?" Right? That’s an Israeli import from American Judaism. - Right. - By the same token, I think we, in America, we need to import the idea of the Mechina program. - Yeah. - The idea of Jewish service that all Israelis like you serve in the army. How can we do this for American-Jews so they feel like they’re a part of something in the community and not just, “I’ve had my bar mitzvah. I’m done.” Right now, I think one of the things I was exposed at is through J-Ventures, which you’re also an LP of, and the fund that we’re both involved with. But I came to the room and you have about a hundred partners in the room, all incredible executives and investors. A lot of them, Israelis a lot of them American-Jewish. And all of a sudden, I believe there were some Americans there who said that this is their first interaction with Israelis. Israelis, all of a sudden, are communicating with American-Jews and not just, you know, in the Sunnyvale kibbutz So, I think that I’m learning also that there are these huge differences. And one of the things that I was exposed to was the idea that, as an Israeli, I don’t remember the last time my friends and I really visited the synagogue in Israel, yet a lot of my Jewish friends here it’s kind of a thing to go to synagogue. And it's and you know almost I feel like you’re more Jewish than I am, and I’m very Jewish. So, it’s really interesting to see all these different cultures come together. Right. I think that what your experiencing and being a part of with J-Ventures and at the JCC is this acknowledgement that we can learn from each other and be a part of each other’s worlds and give and take spiritually, culturally, religiously, and then we can love each other as a family even if we disagree. - Yeah. - Right and this is the part that I fear actually, Michael, is that this next generation of young American-Jews are only judging their relationship with Israel through the two things that they have issues with, right. The Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians and also the Chief Rabbinate in Israel. The two things that many American-Jews disagree with, that’s the whole lens though which they view Israel is through those two things. And I’m saying no, no, no. The relationship with Israel is much bigger, much more beautiful, much longer lasting and much more complicated and you have to kind of transcend those differences. And by the same token, I’m saying to Israeli-Jews, don’t just look at us as failed Zionists because we don’t have the ḥutspâ to make aliyah. Don’t just look at us and say, “You’re not even gonna be Jewish in a few generations because of intermarriage or assimilation, or anti-Semitism, right. So, we’re talking past each other. And what you’re seeing with organization like J-Ventures or the work we’re doing here at the JCC is this integration, the weaving together of Israeli-Jews and American-Jews, and it’s making all of us better. And that way, if something happens like in the next few weeks with annexation, Michael, there’s gonna be, especially in the liberal bay area, there’s gonna be a lot of ... for American-Jews around what’s happening in Israel. But if you love Israel and you recognize that they have to make some tough decisions that maybe we don’t agree with and we have every right to talk about our positions on these, but don’t let it define your entire relationship with Israel. Right? Figure out how just like when you’re sitting around the Shabbat table, Michael, with your crazy Uncle Larry who has crazy views Maybe he’s a Trump-lover and you’re not. Or maybe he hates Trump and you love Trump, but you’re still family and you have to figure out how to sit around the Shabbos table and the Pesach table and embrace each other even if you’re arguing. This is what Jews have done for generations, the machloket. - Yeah. Right. We’ve never agreed on each other. Yeah. You put two Jews in a room, you get three different opinions. Exactly. Exactly. Zack, talk to me a little bit about where are we headed. You’re seeing these trends. You were a part of AIPAC for many, many years. In leadership positions, both at the JCC and AIPAC. Where are we headed, let’s say, 10 years from now or 20 years from now? Are there big changes? Are there different trends? Optimism? Pessimism? Yeah, I think that there are trends that can go either way, frankly. Number 1, we’re seeing institutional affiliations dropping. Right? So, membership in American synagogues is dropping. The old legacy institutions are dropping. And you have the older generation of Jews who are wringing their hands and ... and worried but they shouldn’t be because this next generation, your generation, you’re not walking away from Judaism. They’re starting up new, cool Jewish ways of doing, right? There’s the Urban Adamah, and there's Moishe House, and there’s Wilderness Torah, and there’s At The Well. But there’s also this ethos of the Jewish Tikkun Olam, social action, right. Jews are doing Jewish by getting involved with the racial justice movement, right So, they’re still doing Jewish. Right. But the dropping of institutional affiliation is going to change the landscape. That’s a trend that we have to watch out for. The second trend is the ethno-graphics are shifting, Michael, which means that it’s no longer about, are you Ashkenazi or are you Sephardi? like I said, right There are Jews of color. I’ll tell you a story. There’s a Japanese woman on our board of directors here at the JCC. She’s not Jewish. She didn’t convert. She married a Jewish guy. The Jewish guy, he doesn’t really care about doing Jewish. He’s happy that his wife cares. She’s the one who’s doing She’s Japanese and she’s the one driving the kids to Hebrew school. She’s the one who makes challah. She’s the one who does the Passover sedar. So tell me, who’s Jewish in that relationship, right? Right. The future is going to belong to those people who choose to do Jew, we’re all going to be Jews by choice, right. We’re all going to be Jews by choice. That’s another trend we have to pay attention to. The third is, this is the first time ever, ever, ever in Jewish history where there’s both a strong Jewish homeland in Israel and a strong Jewish diaspora, mainly here in America. There’s been one or the other, but now we have both and figuring how we work together, it goes back to what I was saying before, we have to find a way to transcend our differences. These trends are going to be incredibly important. And the last thing I'll say is - Doesn’t it feel also that the Jews in the diaspora, or the centralized ones in the US, it still feels pretty fragmented. You know you have a strong centralization of Jews in, let’s say New York. And then, you have in Palo Alto. And you have maybe north So do you consider that centralized or is that also because the distance from here to New York is just as great as, you know, from Israel to London. It’s true. But those distances are breaking down now because of the ability to do exactly what you and I are doing right now. And that speaks to what I think is the last biggest trend: science and technology. The massive pace and speed of science and technology are changing everything. Look, you and I can have this conversation even though we’re just a couple of miles away from each other. But we could do this with folks in Israel. You can have a Haredi woman and a secular man, or vice versa actually talking like this now right across time zones, across mechitza. You can have age. No, it goes away all of a sudden. So, yes, there is a central place here in Palo Alto and a central place in New York, but we’re breaking down these barriers now. And so, think about how we can now have real Talmud study with the chavruta that’s sitting thousands and thousands of miles away. Okay, think about how science and technology are changing things so it’s not just a Shabbos elevator in Jerusalem, Michael, but what if Tesla allows for a Shabbos car? So, now we can drive on Shabbos. Imagine if, they’re now figuring out how to make these impossible burgers and this plant-based meat. So, imagine now that we can have actually kosher pork and kosher bacon. Science is changing everything and those are the small things, but imagine the big things as well. Imagine when virtual reality allows us to actually stand at the base of Mt. Sinai and experience revelation for ourselves. Right? So, time goes away. Space goes away. Science and technology is changing everything and those are the positive trends, but it can also have a dark side as well. For example, the genetic testing. If somebody says, “Well, you can now test whether you are genetically Jewish or not, and that means you’re either in or you’re out" I could see that going in a very, very dark and scary - No, and obviously I mean in Israel, there’s a bunch of different conflicts. Tel-Aviv just recently, they very recently announced that gay couples can declare themselves married and get the benefits of being married, which is a huge, huge incredible feat that they managed to get through, finally. But I am also witnessing in Israel that there is a greater conflict emerging between secular Jews and religion Jews within Israel, between the regular citizens and then the Haredis. And one of the amazing things that I’ve been observing through technology and such is Moshe Friedman from Bnei Brak with ... he brings on this amazing group of Haredi technology enthusiasts and creates this venture capital arm in Bnei Brak, bringing together also people from Tel-Aviv and creating this mishmash, and showing that, yes, we’re actually not that different. Sure, one eats pork. The other one doesn’t. But we’re all the same people at the end. And I think it’s beautiful. Zack, we have just a few minutes left. I wanna get your mind about leadership a little bit because you have dozens of years of experience with leadership and I’d love to get your point on leadership as a whole. Thank you, Michael. And it’s been a great conversation. I love the way that you’ve made this happen. It’s very grassroots and it’s very indicative of what’s going to happen in this next generation, right. Thank you. - No longer do you have to have somebody heckschering you, blessing you, saying, “You are now a leader; therefore, you get to interview whomever." It’s gonna come up and bubble up organically, grassroots the way you have. So, I love that you’re - Thank you. an example of this and thank you for inviting me to be a part of this conversation. Look, leadership takes all forms as we know. And people talk about peace time leaders and war time leaders, peace time CEOs, war time CEOs and you have to take on different personality types for different environments. I think about what a real leader has to do and what a real leader doesn’t have to do. And I have this acronym. It just happens to be the word scaffolding. I think a real strong leader has to offer the scaffolding and allow the rest of his or her team to do the rest. And what does this scaffolding entail? The S, you have to offer the strategy. How can you be the one thinking about what it’s gonna take to achieve the goals of the organization? The C, you have to change the culture and set the culture and determine are you gonna micromanage or are you gonna give people a lot of freedom. Is it going to be a culture of shared leadership or not, okay. I think the A is the architecture. What does the setup of the organization look like? What does the org chart look like? Who reports to whom? Right? F, focus. You have to provide the focus so that people aren't wandering off, but you also have to allow people a little bit of autonomy in that. The second F is forecasting. You have to be able to see the future. Right? People are looking for what is the future, what's right around the bend and some of the questions you asked me, right. The O is for oversight and determining what oversight. Are you gonna measure daily metrics, weekly KPIs, monthly, quarterly? What does that look like? Right? The L is for leadership, okay, and leadership development. And that’s not just kind of like the generic way, but who are you looking to in the future to bring onto your board of directors, to be your next round of investors? Right. Who’s your kitchen cabinet? That’s leadership development. So, not just a one-man show, but who are the people that are gonna help you and help the whole organization lead with you. Right, exactly. I is inspiration. In many ways, the CEO has to be the CIO, the Chief Inspiration Officer. Right. The N is for network because you are the guy at the top or the woman at the top and you are the only one who could talk to other leaders at that level. So, you are the one who keeps that network in your own industry. Right. So, the network is the N. And finally, the last is the G, which is the golden circle. Simon Sinek has this great TED talk, you’ve probably seen it, about the golden circle. Yes And we all have to sell from the center of the circle, which is the why. So, you as a leader, have to provide the why. What is the reason why you are doing whatever you’re doing? So, that’s how I think about leadership and anything outside of that acronym, I leave it to the rest of the team. Zack, why are you doing what you’re doing? Why are you the CEO of the JCC in Palo Alto? Why? Because this is my calling. This is what I’m meant to do. Really, this is in my kishkes. It’s what I am meant to be doing at this time in my life. I took this job. I loved AIPAC. I ran the Pacific Northwest region of AIPAC for almost 15 years. I loved it. I didn’t want to leave, but when somebody approached me about this opportunity, I realized that I I actually believe the next 100 years of American-Jewish life, Michael, is gonna be built by the Jews out here. The last 100 years of American-Jewish life was built by East Coast Jews. Everything that we know from the synagogue structures, the legacy institution. New York Jewish deli defined our food, right? Jewish humor came from the Borscht Belt in Broadway. But the next 100 years of American-Jewish life, it's gonna be built by the Jews out here because they have the resources, they are the ones who are disenfranchised with the way that we used to do Jewish and they want to change it up, and they have the willingness to break glass, move fast, think like Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. So, those three things mean that these Jews out here are going to create the next generation of Jewish life. They may not know it yet, but I want to be a part of that conversation. I want to help them think about what it means to do that. That’s why I’m in this role. I love it. I love it. Zack, last question, the most important one. I need three words that you would use to define yourself or any of your colleagues at the JCC or AIPAC would use to define Zack Bodner. Good question. I think passionate, as you could probably hear from me. I’m passionate about life, about the causes that I attach myself to, about the people in my world. So, number one is passionate. I think number two is genuine. I always have to be myself even if that means sharing bad news as I’ve had to do in this last week with the changes that are coming at the JCC because of our budget situation. Yeah. And I think, finally, the last word I would use to describe myself is gregarious. I’m a people person. I like to be out there. I like to engage. I like to which is why this lockdown and the social distancing is so hard for me in particular, right? This way of connecting is great, but it doesn’t replace I want to give you a hug, Michael. I want to just be able to sit and break bread with you. I want to share a drink with you. And so, being the gregarious extrovert that I am, it’s very hard for me in this situation, but I think those are, at least, some of the words I would use to describe myself. I love it. Zack, thank you so, so much. I love that you’re on ... right now. [laughs] Really phenomenal. Thank you for the inspiration and for the time. I learned so much. So, thank you for that. - Thank you, Michael. Appreciate you inviting me. Thank you and I’ll see you at the JCC one day when corona is over. One day, God-willing. - Take care. - All right. Take care. - Thanks, bye-bye. - Bye-bye.
