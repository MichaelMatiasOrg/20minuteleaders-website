1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,080
And I really believe

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,000
that business is done human to human.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,080
And it's about bringing humans together.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,480
And because the community is people,

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,040
all you need to do really is listen

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,720
to the people in the community

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,070
and understand their needs.

8
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,400
Orlie Gruper,

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,520
thank you so much for joining me

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,440
on 20 Minute Leaders.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,920
Good morning.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,040
Good morning.

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,360
Thank you for having me.

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,600
It's a pleasure and an honor

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,200
to have you here.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,360
Executive director of EcoMotion.

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,120
The whole smart mobility space

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,440
is you know, fascinating.

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,840
There's so many advancements

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,240
and there's so many things

21
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,920
that are happening

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,400
that I can't even keep track.

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,640
And when I think about,

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,560
you know, where we're headed

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,000
in the next five or 10 years,

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,760
I'm incredibly excited.

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,640
You know, before we even talk about

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,400
your journey and who you are,

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,320
tell me a little bit about

30
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,120
what is smart mobility

31
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,080
and why is it something

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,640
that is so fascinating to you?

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,640
Wow.

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,320
It's my favorite topic.

35
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,600
So, smart mobility

36
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,760
is anything that is smarter,

37
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,560
greener, more efficient,

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,000
better save more money or

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,358
also just improve I guess,

40
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:42,600
something that is smarter than before.

41
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,363
If you look at mobility until now,

42
00:01:45,364 --> 00:01:49,160
mobility used by vehicle,

43
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,745
now we're starting to see

44
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:51,760
that metro in Tel Aviv

45
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,560
and micro-mobility and bubble,

46
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,320
which is Via technologies

47
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,480
and all these other things.

48
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,725
So, we're right now seeing this

49
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:03,240
whole new revolution that is coming.

50
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,400
And basically I look at this revolution

51
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
kind of like we had

52
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,040
the Industrial Revolution, and then

53
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,880
we had the telecom revolution.

54
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,040
And what I love about the telecom

55
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,640
revolution, this is what I compare it

56
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,603
with in the mobility world is that

57
00:02:20,604 --> 00:02:22,520
when we had the whole

58
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,480
telecommunication era

59
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:27,440
that had a lot of investment and a lot of

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,080
developing of technologies in this field,

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,960
a lot of money was thrown in.

62
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,680
In the end, we haven't seen, like we,

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,200
we didn't even understand

64
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
where we're going to.

65
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,600
And we didn't understand that we're

66
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,108
all end up with a flat screen. Right?

67
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:44,801
It's something

68
00:02:44,802 --> 00:02:46,480
that no one thinks still happening

69
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,959
and this is like

70
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,800
a very given thing to us these days.

71
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,880
So, mobility for me is the same thing.

72
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,600
There's right now a lot of investment,

73
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,760
a lot of improvements.

74
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,000
A lot of people are working on it

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,360
from a lot of different angles.

76
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,151
We have no idea what [--],

77
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:02,776
but for sure it's going to be

78
00:03:02,777 --> 00:03:06,000
a whole new, exciting era for us.

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,840
I think that is such an interesting

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,040
analogy, this flat screen analogy.

81
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,962
Now, when I'm thinking back

82
00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:11,880
to when I was a kid, you know,

83
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,775
we're talking about 2004, 2005.

84
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,080
And we're looking at all these

85
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,120
advancements with the telecommunications.

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,440
Nobody really knew that in 2006,

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,920
Steve Jobs was going to go on stage

88
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,120
and show the flat iPhone,

89
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,320
the touch screen, and really create

90
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,880
a whole revolution in that sense.

91
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,840
And I think it's just inspiring

92
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,480
to think that we don't really know

93
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,278
what this iPhone representation

94
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:36,829
is going to be in the smart mobility space

95
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,800
moving forwards.

96
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,360
But Orlie, take me back a little bit

97
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,000
about to your journey.

98
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,160
How do you even get started

99
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,280
with smart mobility?

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,680
What is that trigger and what have been

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,840
some of your experiences

102
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,680
within the space?

103
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,366
Well, today, you know,

104
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,352
I see that it's farther

105
00:03:54,353 --> 00:03:56,375
than I thought in the beginning,

106
00:03:56,575 --> 00:03:59,702
because I was always passionate about

107
00:03:59,703 --> 00:04:01,531
old fashioned vehicles.

108
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,280
I wanted a motorcycle

109
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,120
since I can remember.

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,720
And at the age of 15,

111
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,400
and I really wanted one already

112
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:09,487
and I could have it.

113
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:10,160
At the age of 16,

114
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,880
I started getting lessons.

115
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,360
And my parents let me have a lesson,

116
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,700
but they wouldn't mind me first

117
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:17,720
like in the end.

118
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,446
So, it turns out

119
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:19,971
I had to found my own company.

120
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:20,680
And I founded

121
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,400
an electric motorcycle company.

122
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,240
But I guess, professionally, it started

123
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,200
in the Army, in the Air Force.

124
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,760
I was

125
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,440
exposed to the whole aviation world.

126
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,948
I was in the room operations

127
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:36,948
of an F-16 squad,

128
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:38,240
and then a commander of course.

129
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,400
And I love aviation

130
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,080
and everything it brought with it.

131
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,200
And how, you know, it's crazy,

132
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,000
but we really take for granted the thing

133
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,080
that we go into this

134
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,160
vehicle, even if it's a car,

135
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,336
we sit down and then we come out

136
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:55,560
on the other side

137
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,840
after, you know, just resting for a while.

138
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,960
And after the army,

139
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,000
I was recruited to operate

140
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,360
private aviation fleet.

141
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:07,799
So, I continued with this passion.

142
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:11,415
And I did my BA in business majored in IT

143
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,520
and then founded the Blitz Motors.

144
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,480
I sold my half six years ago.

145
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,980
They just IPO-ed last week,

146
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:20,400
which is really exciting.

147
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:22,720
Wow. Congratulations.

148
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,960
Yeah, it's amazing.

149
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,256
It's electric motorcycles, you know.

150
00:05:27,257 --> 00:05:29,369
And every motorcycle that someone,

151
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,272
like got off the road, old school petrol

152
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:35,916
with the whole smoke coming out

153
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:38,863
type of motorcycle and putting on

154
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:41,720
a new electric green coagulant.

155
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,857
It's like, everyone sold is like

156
00:05:44,858 --> 00:05:46,720
it was an amazing,

157
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,040
amazing experience for me.

158
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,480
And I think that's incredible.

159
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,759
Orlie, I have to ask about the founding

160
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,997
of the Blitz company

161
00:05:55,998 --> 00:05:58,280
with electric motorcycles.

162
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,750
It has to be a little bit different

163
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:02,329
than starting another software company

164
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,280
or you know,

165
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
the typical startup that you see today

166
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,400
that is mainly software focused

167
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,160
with either BTC or B2B.

168
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,458
You're here selling literally vehicles

169
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,583
that have to be certified

170
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:13,360
to go on the street.

171
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,080
They have to be saved.

172
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,347
They have to provide some

173
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:16,720
good experience to their users.

174
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,733
Tell me a little bit about

175
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:19,146
this founding of the company

176
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:20,700
and some of the interesting challenges

177
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:23,000
that you had along the way.

178
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,240
Wow. So many challenges.

179
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,800
Well, I guess it started really

180
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,956
by understanding what is needed

181
00:06:33,957 --> 00:06:36,400
and what exists, right?

182
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Because when you're doing a startup,

183
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,720
it doesn't matter what you do.

184
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,680
It's okay if you start searching

185
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,120
and you see that other things exist,

186
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,491
which are the same,

187
00:06:51,492 --> 00:06:53,440
we're all on the same market.

188
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,560
It's okay. It means, there is a market.

189
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,360
But you need to see how you do it better

190
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,531
and how offer something

191
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:01,258
that they don't offer, right?

192
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,640
Right.

193
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,520
So, in motorcycles,

194
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,072
I mean it was, I saw that there's

195
00:07:08,073 --> 00:07:11,560
a very high power but super expensive one

196
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:13,540
and not expensive ones,

197
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,004
but not at all meeting the requirements

198
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:18,089
of the Israeli rider, right?

199
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,280
They want to be

200
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,400
on the road, they're into power.

201
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,560
And then I went out looking for one

202
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,840
and we couldn't really find one.

203
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:32,099
So, we found different manufacturers

204
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,385
that created different parts

205
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,440
and found an assembler

206
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
that assembled everything

207
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:40,964
under our brand and created this vehicle,

208
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:43,120
two-wheel vehicle that

209
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,529
was at the same price

210
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,520
of petrol vehicles on the market.

211
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,920
But still, you were saving

212
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,040
from day one and you're high powered.

213
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,000
So, we gave people what they wanted.

214
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,720
And regarding challenges, so many.

215
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,520
Wow.

216
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,960
One time we meet, you know,

217
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:00,920
a manufacturer that will do it,

218
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,880
that will get on this adventure

219
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,640
second to get the Israeli government

220
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,920
on board with this

221
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,760
Ministry of Transportation

222
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,160
and then the Israeli Standard Institute,

223
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,080
and there's just that is a whole,

224
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,320
is a whole challenge.

225
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,702
We have a lot to go through

226
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:22,600
with easing bureaucracy

227
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,240
and then it was creating

228
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,530
a showroom in Tel Aviv,

229
00:08:26,531 --> 00:08:30,589
and creating a whole garages network

230
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:32,680
all over Israel so they could

231
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,120
maintain the vehicle and then, you know,

232
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,640
creating a clientele and maintaining.

233
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,520
The thing I loved about the clients

234
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,640
is that they created their own bike club.

235
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,640
Like the electric motorcycle bikers club.

236
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,080
And really moving, yeah.

237
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,600
It really shows how

238
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:50,360
people were connected to our products.

239
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,400
I love that. Orlie,

240
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,480
I think this is a perfect segue

241
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,413
to the whole community scene.

242
00:08:56,414 --> 00:08:57,607
Because your product,

243
00:08:57,608 --> 00:08:59,480
your electric motorcycles created,

244
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,400
created some grassroots communities

245
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,383
that started as a result

246
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:04,960
of people buying into your product,

247
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,640
the mission and the experience.

248
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,560
But then you went and you intentionally

249
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,440
helped run and are still running,

250
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,686
i think the biggest

251
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:14,960
smart mobility community.

252
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
I think over 600 startups

253
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,000
are involved with community,

254
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,400
am I right?

255
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,494
Yeah. Over 600 start ups

256
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:24,720
and 12,000 community members.

257
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,960
Because startup can't really

258
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,920
grow within a void.

259
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,400
We started a community that brings

260
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,160
together all the relevant players.

261
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,960
So we have industry players, investors,

262
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,280
government entities, principalities,

263
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,160
academia, all in one.

264
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,240
And yeah, it's amazing.

265
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,600
EcoMotion started in 2012.

266
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,200
I used to be an entrepreneur.

267
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:46,150
As part of the community,

268
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:49,760
I started meetups, we're like 15 people.

269
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,190
And the guy they brought to talk

270
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:55,120
was talking about

271
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,680
innovative design more in 2012.

272
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,827
We weren't really talking about

273
00:09:59,828 --> 00:10:01,720
the whole digitalization yet,

274
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,294
but understanding that that's the future

275
00:10:04,295 --> 00:10:05,321
and how Israel

276
00:10:05,322 --> 00:10:07,960
in this digitalization of mobility,

277
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,880
we talked about smarter mobility before

278
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,640
so, digitalization is a huge part of that

279
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,880
and how Israel now has

280
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,720
an advantage to do that.

281
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,720
And this community is amazing.

282
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,154
It's moving, actually.

283
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,726
Everyone is so engaged

284
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:26,812
in creating this better future

285
00:10:26,813 --> 00:10:28,480
and really good people.

286
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,600
So, it's a great job.

287
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,040
I love that. Orlie,

288
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,347
tell me a little bit about

289
00:10:34,348 --> 00:10:35,681
building a community

290
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:37,280
and running a community.

291
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,760
First in general,

292
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,520
the different challenges

293
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,823
and the things to keep in mind

294
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:42,840
when building a community,

295
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,520
but then specifically smart mobility.

296
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,080
And in a growing industry that is often

297
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,680
perhaps, misunderstood about its potential

298
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,320
or it's still if you can consider

299
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:55,520
pre-iPhone era, right,

300
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,480
in terms of the analogy

301
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,520
that we had before.

302
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,640
So, what are some of the challenges

303
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,040
and exhilarating factors

304
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,200
of running a community?

305
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,240
So, community is people.

306
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,520
That's what you need to understand.

307
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,400
And I really believe

308
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
that business is done

309
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,920
human to human, and it's about

310
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,280
bringing humans together.

311
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,800
And because the community is people,

312
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,400
all you need to do really is listen

313
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,040
to the people in the community

314
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,120
and understand their needs.

315
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,600
And then with the power

316
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,160
of the community and the quantity

317
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,400
to deliver those needs.

318
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,473
And these needs keeps changing

319
00:11:35,474 --> 00:11:36,440
all the time.

320
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,160
So, you really needs to be on top of it.

321
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,400
We have on our team a community manager,

322
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,680
a partnerships manager.

323
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,320
We have an implementation manager.

324
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,480
And yet when we meet with startups,

325
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,400
the whole team meet with them.

326
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,330
It's not like one person job

327
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:53,880
because it's really important for me

328
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,805
that the whole team

329
00:11:54,806 --> 00:11:56,120
can jump up of the trends,

330
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,600
the technology and the needs to hear

331
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,218
the startup all the time

332
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,994
and to try and pick up, you know,

333
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:03,476
in between all these meetings,

334
00:12:03,477 --> 00:12:04,760
try and connect the dots.

335
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,960
So, when I just started at EcoMotion,

336
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,560
for example, I heard a lot of startups

337
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,640
saying, okay, now there are so many

338
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,756
investors out there

339
00:12:13,757 --> 00:12:15,880
in the field of mobility, how do we know

340
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,640
who is relevant for us and so,

341
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
I heard this a lot of times

342
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,893
and then I was like,

343
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:27,240
okay, we need to do something.

344
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,945
So, ran into the kitchen

345
00:12:28,946 --> 00:12:30,792
and started cooking a plan.

346
00:12:30,992 --> 00:12:32,840
And we understood in the end that we want

347
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,520
to map all the investors out there.

348
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,680
And now we have like a digital map where

349
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,852
it goes according to the different sectors

350
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:40,680
as we see them.

351
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,120
So, you can see really the logos

352
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
into different categories

353
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,800
and you can filter by round.

354
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,280
So, you know

355
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,360
who's the relevant investor for you.

356
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,718
And when you click one you have a whole

357
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:51,480
all the information about this investor

358
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,513
and who is the person

359
00:12:52,514 --> 00:12:53,840
to contact in the company.

360
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,600
So, we don't need to connect

361
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,293
and do intros and things like that.

362
00:12:58,294 --> 00:12:59,840
The community can meet each other.

363
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,967
But it's a lot about

364
00:13:00,968 --> 00:13:04,169
getting supporting tools for that

365
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,280
and facilitating those interactions.

366
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,499
That makes perfect sense. Yeah.

367
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,440
Tell me a little bit, though,

368
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,840
about investments in smart mobility.

369
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,134
Are they the same

370
00:13:16,135 --> 00:13:17,960
as in a regular startup?

371
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,160
Is the due diligence process

372
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,480
is a little different?

373
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,040
What is the thinking process when you go

374
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,160
and evaluate a company that is perhaps

375
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,920
doing something that

376
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,217
the market is not yet accustomed to,

377
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:29,712
there maybe not even governmental support

378
00:13:29,713 --> 00:13:31,280
or infrastructure yet,

379
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,880
but you're building a technology that

380
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,400
could potentially have a positive impact?

381
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,536
Well, I think

382
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:39,539
most governments of the world are now,

383
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,508
you're probably talking about autonomy.

384
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:42,920
So, I think most governments

385
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,600
in the world are now on board with this

386
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,320
in trying to understand how they create

387
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,720
regulation that is

388
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,600
supportive and not restraining.

389
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,029
Because it is really hard

390
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,896
to make up rules today

391
00:13:55,897 --> 00:13:57,653
for something that, you know,

392
00:13:57,654 --> 00:13:59,271
you only know the impact

393
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,360
in deployments in a few years.

394
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,880
So, regarding investments, I think

395
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,400
it's like many other fields.

396
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:07,200
The first thing

397
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,960
in investments is the team.

398
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,640
So, that's a really important one.

399
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:13,160
It doesn't matter what field you are.

400
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,406
The team is the first thing

401
00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:16,125
people look at when they put money.

402
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:17,760
They put more money on the human

403
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,280
than they do on the technology.

404
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,960
Because in the end, the technology

405
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,760
will be made by humans creating it.

406
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,232
So, an investor wants to know that

407
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:32,898
the entrepreneurs will be able

408
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:35,760
to stand back up once they fall,

409
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,220
will be able to find solutions

410
00:14:38,221 --> 00:14:39,634
when they're put on a brick wall

411
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:41,966
because they will, many times.

412
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:43,600
And they're frustrating in the domain.

413
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,120
But that's, I think, the main focus.

414
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,800
And there's many different

415
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,600
types of mobility when we look at it.

416
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,320
So, you have the whole

417
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,600
autonomous and connected world.

418
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,680
And in this, like last year or so,

419
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,989
there's a lot of talk about

420
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,640
level four and five being pushed back.

421
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,960
But level two, three here and now,

422
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,960
and there is so much technology

423
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,120
is needed already for these levels.

424
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,023
So, it shouldn't frighten anyone

425
00:15:17,024 --> 00:15:18,794
wanting to go into this field

426
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:21,651
because there is so much more to be

427
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:23,120
created for that.

428
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,400
And that's the near future.

429
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,080
And also, I've seen really high

430
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,320
A and seed round investment.

431
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,168
So, a lot of companies

432
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:36,520
can really run for a while.

433
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,183
And the other things

434
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:40,091
are like mobility services.

435
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,280
So, it can be an app like Moovit.

436
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,200
Yeah. This is our mobility today.

437
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,470
And it could be

438
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:49,190
kick scooter shared platform.

439
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:51,440
Like we need to remember

440
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:53,360
Bird and Lime and all of those

441
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:56,160
were non-existent like five years ago.

442
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,040
Right?

443
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,486
It's like a whole new thing.

444
00:15:58,487 --> 00:16:00,300
It's mind boggling

445
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:01,145
And it's awesome too

446
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:02,618
because we don't see our life

447
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:04,840
without it now.

448
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,840
And think how much

449
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,984
there is more to create on that

450
00:16:07,985 --> 00:16:08,675
and how much

451
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,080
there is more to optimize.

452
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,250
And the mobility in different countries

453
00:16:14,251 --> 00:16:16,200
is not at all the same.

454
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,792
Like Israel doesn't have

455
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:20,389
the great public transportation

456
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,400
where other countries do.

457
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,320
And there's advantages

458
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,000
and opportunities in each one of those.

459
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,326
Right.

460
00:16:28,327 --> 00:16:29,120
Orlie, tell me a little bit about

461
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,412
the future of smart mobility

462
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:32,640
from your take

463
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,960
and from observing the work

464
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,760
of hundreds of startups.

465
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,320
What are some of the most exciting

466
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,080
advancements tangibly that we can expect

467
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,880
to see in our streets, on our phones,

468
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,080
satellites, whatever it may be?

469
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,926
How is our consumer behavior

470
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:49,343
expected to change realistically

471
00:16:49,344 --> 00:16:52,680
over the next five or 10 years?

472
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,408
Wow. Five or 10 years, okay.

473
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:58,371
You're narrowing down

474
00:16:58,372 --> 00:17:00,520
to more like the now.

475
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,720
Right.

476
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,320
What we are feeling the

477
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,880
five to 10 years in the shorter version,

478
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,360
shorter term is,

479
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,040
and I'm speaking this is too hard

480
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,600
for me because you know it's,

481
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,440
a lot have happened in the past 10 years.

482
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,040
But in this five to 10 years, I think

483
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,080
everything will become more seamless.

484
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,680
We're still buying tickets for stuff

485
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,000
that's not going to happen anymore.

486
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,356
You're just going to use things

487
00:17:31,357 --> 00:17:35,360
and will be added to your bill kind of thing .

488
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,627
Where if you hop on a kickscooter

489
00:17:37,628 --> 00:17:39,539
and then you get on a train

490
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,680
and you come off

491
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,600
and then you get on a bus then,

492
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,600
all of that ride will just be billed to you.

493
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,711
You don't have to deal with,

494
00:17:47,712 --> 00:17:49,240
with too much payments.

495
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:55,120
In terms of logistics, I feel,

496
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,932
these five to 10 years,

497
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:57,029
from what we experience

498
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,719
in this whole corona era is like,

499
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,160
e-commerce, yeah, like craziness.

500
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,680
And this affects also logistics.

501
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,894
And I feel like logistics

502
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:09,640
is going to improve tremendously.

503
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,920
We're looking at instead of big trucks,

504
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,600
like picking things off the ship

505
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,320
and taking that into the city,

506
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,640
it's going to break down into smaller,

507
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,080
smaller packages and more urban like

508
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,200
logistics, something that is

509
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,560
more compatible with the city.

510
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,960
100%.

511
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,680
In whole, I feel this city is,

512
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,160
and most cities are

513
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,720
making more walkways and more bike lanes.

514
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,200
And Amsterdam was there

515
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,760
long ago before us.

516
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,307
But it really shows right now

517
00:18:47,308 --> 00:18:51,087
that we're going back to this era

518
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,720
or forward to this era.

519
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,691
Regarding the autonomy,

520
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:59,560
then I think in time years

521
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,911
it'll be weird to drive

522
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:04,743
a whole way from our house

523
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,040
to the end destination.

524
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,520
I can't say, you know,

525
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,080
what level will be at and all of that.

526
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,000
I always say I'm not a prophet,

527
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,100
but I'm sure it will be weird.

528
00:19:18,101 --> 00:19:19,842
You know what I mean?

529
00:19:19,843 --> 00:19:20,920
I love that.

530
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,518
I love that distinction, by the way, Orlie.

531
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,960
Because you're not just saying that,

532
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,280
you know, it'll be common.

533
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,149
The fact that you're saying

534
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,630
that it'll be weird to drive the whole way

535
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:30,971
it implies that it's not just

536
00:19:30,972 --> 00:19:32,753
that the people who ride the wave

537
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,520
are going to be the first consumers

538
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,236
that are going to jump into, you know,

539
00:19:36,237 --> 00:19:37,320
like we have with Tesla's.

540
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,049
But you're saying that

541
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:38,999
our consumer behavior

542
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,813
is going to already shift in such a way

543
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,844
that it'll be odd to not have

544
00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:45,597
some sort of autonomy

545
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:47,160
along your driving route.

546
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,303
Perhaps, some people

547
00:19:48,304 --> 00:19:49,871
will have full autonomy.

548
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:51,240
But the average person,

549
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,064
it will be weird if they don't.

550
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:54,080
Orlie, unfortunately, you know,

551
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,800
20 minutes go by so quickly.

552
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
But I really want to thank you

553
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,960
for your time and for your generosity.

554
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,120
It goes by quick, right?

555
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,398
But I'd love to ask you

556
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:04,386
for the most important question,

557
00:20:04,387 --> 00:20:05,560
which is three words

558
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,840
that you would use to describe yourself.

559
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,623
And I really wanted

560
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:08,698
to talk about gardening,

561
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:10,040
but we just didn't have time.

562
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,320
So, we'll keep that for the next episode.

563
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,315
Yeah.

564
00:20:14,316 --> 00:20:17,400
Three words I use to describe myself.

565
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,320
Well, I guess I'm a child of light,

566
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,720
love and creation.

567
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,080
That's like the three words

568
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,920
that guide me in life.

569
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,170
This is what I feel

570
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:32,040
is the true meaning to everything.

571
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,840
Wonderful.

572
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,760
And what motivates me.

573
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:36,200
Wonderful.

574
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,680
That sounds great.

575
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,760
Orlie, thank you very, very much.

576
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,000
This is a fantastic thing of inspiration.

577
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,560
And stay safe and stay healthy.

578
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,960
I can't wait to share this to the world.

579
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,910
Thank you.

580
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,040
Yes. Thank you.

581
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,040
Chow chow.
