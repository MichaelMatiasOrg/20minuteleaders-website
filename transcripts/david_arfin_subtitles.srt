1
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,400
Wonderful.

2
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,800
Okay, great.

3
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,120
David Arfin, thank you so much

4
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,840
for being on my show

5
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,640
20 Minute Leaders.

6
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,430
My pleasure. Good to be here.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,380
I can't wait for this.

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,560
[--]

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:38,880
Yeah.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,040
Well, first off, where are you

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,110
because this is not a virtual background.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,280
A lot of people have this

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,200
is as a virtual background,

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,400
but you're actually there.

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,520
I am right now staying in

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,720
Potomac, Maryland,

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,430
which is a suburb of DC.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,470
I was actually born in Potomac, Maryland.

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,515
So, it's quite a funny coincidence.

20
00:00:55,518 --> 00:00:56,250
No kidding.

21
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:56,720
Yes.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,480
So, we are very close

23
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,920
to Great Falls Park,

24
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,120
which is just, it's a national treasure,

25
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,360
as are all of our national parks.

26
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,080
Wonderful. Thank you so much for taking

27
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,200
the time to do this.

28
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,360
I think it's very, it makes a lot of sense

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,200
that this is your background,

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,400
given that you're an expert

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,920
in renewable energy and working in

32
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,400
fast growing companies that are making

33
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,600
a real difference in the world.

34
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,440
Very quick background.

35
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,600
Stanford MBA

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,880
in the Graduate School of Business.

37
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,440
Moving on, you held

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,360
numerous executive positions,

39
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,840
Solar City, Ninedot, so many others

40
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,040
that I missed along the way.

41
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,400
But I'd love to hear a little bit

42
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,000
about you from your journey

43
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,640
going into the space.

44
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:47,000
So, I'd say the journey,

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,880
I can't say, gee,

46
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,600
when I was a business school student

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,120
or an undergraduate,

48
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,160
this is what I always

49
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,360
wanted to do in my life.

50
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,200
Each thing is a response to the needs,

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,040
opportunities and creativity

52
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,080
that I can bring to it.

53
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,080
So, I started professional life

54
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,240
as a community organizer

55
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,080
in the Jewish community in Los Angeles.

56
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,680
Working for the GCRC,

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
which brought in some values

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,760
that I care deeply about.

59
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,120
I worked in Washington, DC

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,000
as a health staffer

61
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,040
and as an education lobbyist.

62
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,080
Then I went to business school,

63
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,880
got a entrepreneurial bug.

64
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,320
Started a few companies,

65
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,680
and then ended up

66
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,320
in 2006 seeing the Al Gore movie

67
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,840
Inconvenient Truth.

68
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,000
And that was eye opening both from

69
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,720
the issues around climate change,

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,480
as well as the business opportunities

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,320
to create some interesting,

72
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,960
sustainable businesses.

73
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,120
So, by a little work

74
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,560
and a bunch of discussions

75
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,600
and happenstance,

76
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,560
I came up with a pretty good idea,

77
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,120
together with some other people,

78
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,880
to do a solar leasing program.

79
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,320
So, instead of somebody having to make

80
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,560
a massive investment

81
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,080
on having to buy something

82
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,080
that they never bought before,

83
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,960
and they think it's a good idea,

84
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,640
but it's a hard decision to make.

85
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,600
Instead, change the ownership model,

86
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,880
work with some of the incentives

87
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,680
that are out there

88
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,080
and create something new.

89
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,120
And I did that.

90
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,840
And I have been fortunate

91
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,480
to be able to take that idea.

92
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,200
And once that spun off of it

93
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,080
and spend the last 14 years

94
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,200
working in energy with fantastic people.

95
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:33,880
Unbelievable.

96
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,240
And, you know, one of the things

97
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,320
that have always intrigued me

98
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,120
as an entrepreneur,

99
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,320
I'm thinking about solar

100
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,440
and I'm thinking about this transition of

101
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,560
how do you get,

102
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,240
even when the technology matures,

103
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,440
how do you get people to buy

104
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,280
into this, the average citizen?

105
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,960
And I think a lot of it ties back

106
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,600
to the way people manage their money

107
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,400
and how they think about

108
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,080
expenses and rewards,

109
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,520
because essentially the sell,

110
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,280
if I understand it correctly,

111
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,320
let's say solar panels on the roof.

112
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,480
The sell is you're gonna

113
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,040
pay a lot of money now,

114
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,760
you're gonna return the money slowly.

115
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,960
And within a few years,

116
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,680
they're gonna reach a break even point,

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,040
and then you're going to start saving money.

118
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,240
But it's a very different thing than,

119
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:12,920
you're not saying,

120
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,360
"Here, I'm gonna give you cash."

121
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,440
You're saying, "You're gonna lose less."

122
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,040
Right? It's a different mindset.

123
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,640
It's a different sell.

124
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,520
Yeah.

125
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,920
A lot of what I think about

126
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,320
is risk and reward.

127
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,720
Right.

128
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,040
And kind of behavioral economics.

129
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,320
So, if you basically take,

130
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,440
we all have these little things here, right?

131
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,440
Yup. These are new cell phones.

132
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,080
And we know we are going to be subscribing

133
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,440
to expensive services

134
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,400
the rest of our lives.

135
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,440
And if somebody came up to us and said,

136
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,640
"Gee, wouldn't it be nice

137
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,560
if you just put up $30 thousand

138
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,680
and we will,

139
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,200
that's gonna prepay the rest

140
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,000
of your life of cell phones."

141
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,440
You may say, "That's a terrific idea."

142
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,320
But instead, I'd rather spend a thousand

143
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,440
dollars a year on it

144
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,960
over the next 40 years, hopefully.

145
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,320
Right.

146
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,760
Maybe 50 if I'm pushing it.

147
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,840
But whatever that took with it,

148
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,080
whatever that create it.

149
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,120
So, the telecom industry

150
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,720
built out the infrastructure

151
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,560
and made a compelling proposition

152
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,720
to customers to pay by the month,

153
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,880
to pay by the day.

154
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,560
To pay, in autos, it's paid by the mile.

155
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,680
And that's basically how you get

156
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,680
new technologies adopted faster.

157
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,080
You know, the old Xerox machine,

158
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,640
it's hard to sell it for

159
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,400
five thousand dollars to an office.

160
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,880
Sell it for 10 cents a copy?

161
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,200
Go ahead. All day long.

162
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,520
Right. Okay. That's fascinating.

163
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,920
But so, nevertheless,

164
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,600
you watch the Al Gore movie.

165
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,240
Is that really the turning point for you

166
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,120
when you realize that

167
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,680
there was a huge problem in the world

168
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,920
and then you decide to spend

169
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,920
the next 14 years

170
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,640
working on these things?

171
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,600
Well, I kind of knew

172
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,400
there was a problem in the world.

173
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,240
I just didn't know how I connected to it.

174
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,160
Okay. So since then,

175
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,960
you've held all these positions.

176
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:00,960
When did you join

177
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,960
Solar City as Vice President?

178
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,320
I joined Solar City

179
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,000
in the very early days

180
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,480
in May of 2007.

181
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,600
Wow.

182
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,000
And so, I had the idea

183
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,040
of a solar leasing product.

184
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,520
Lyndon Wright and Peter Wright,

185
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,480
the co-founders of Solar City,

186
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,160
instantly got like financing was important

187
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,920
and perhaps just as important

188
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,840
that Elon Musk understood

189
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,480
that customer financing was important.

190
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,800
So, they basically said,

191
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,600
"Ah. That's the idea that we need

192
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,520
to be able to go

193
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,040
from being a small company

194
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,320
to being a large company

195
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,680
to being a massive company."

196
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,240
Ended up getting 35% market share

197
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,680
in the United States.

198
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,240
Which is just unheard of.

199
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,120
Unbelievable.

200
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,160
So, essentially as part of Solar City,

201
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,600
talk to me a little bit about this journey,

202
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,080
because  you have the privilege of

203
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,280
being as a pioneer in this realm

204
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,440
of transitioning a country and going solar

205
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,080
and seeing this technology develop

206
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,040
and seeing how customers interact with it.

207
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,240
So, and you're actually working

208
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,280
on strategy, right?

209
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,320
Within solar cities.

210
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,440
So, how do you work on strategy

211
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,640
in the context of renewable energy?

212
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:16,920
Wow.

213
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,360
Well, you start by understanding

214
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,680
what the customers want

215
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,560
and where where markets are.

216
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,840
In energy.

217
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,520
you have to be very policy sensitive

218
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,240
because everything depends

219
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,920
on the tariffs that you pay.

220
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,960
The incentives and the penalties

221
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,760
that are out there.

222
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,600
A few two different things.

223
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,160
So, you have to understand

224
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,480
and it's a very interdisciplinary area,

225
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,440
which is why I like it.

226
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,800
So, some of my time I get to be,

227
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,840
what is strategy?

228
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,640
It's a combination of economics,

229
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,600
of consumer behavior,

230
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,280
risk and psychology,

231
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,160
finance, energy, hardware,

232
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,440
devices and accounting

233
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,160
and policy.

234
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,920
And I'm not an expert

235
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,400
at any one of those things,

236
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,840
but I have enough experience

237
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,280
and kind of just see

238
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,320
or observe things in the world

239
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,400
where you can combine those.

240
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,200
And if you do that, you can come up

241
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,640
with some interesting solutions.

242
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,560
And what I loved about Solar City was

243
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,480
they let me create this solution,

244
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,680
encouraged me to create it,

245
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,280
put their muscle behind it

246
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,880
and changed the organization,

247
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,000
changed the industry.

248
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,520
And that was a commitment from leadership.

249
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,880
And Lyndon Rive in particular,

250
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,880
to understand that we needed

251
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,240
to sell things differently,

252
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,080
we needed to approach

253
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,160
the consumer differently.

254
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,560
And it was a really interesting

255
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,520
disciplinary approach

256
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,240
and it was a big risk.

257
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,280
I thought it was

258
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,520
obvious that it would work.

259
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,400
And there were months

260
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,840
and months that was hard to do.

261
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,000
And in particular,

262
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,960
when we started this,

263
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,560
remember I said we joined in 2000

264
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,160
and I joined Solar City right

265
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,520
as they head-started in 2007.

266
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,840
That was right before

267
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,080
the big crash of 2008.

268
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,280
So, to go to the Wall Street banks

269
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:07,920
and to say,

270
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,600
"We'd like you to buy a portfolio

271
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,640
of 5000 rooftop solar systems."

272
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,280
during the midst of a housing crisis

273
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,040
that we have never seen before.

274
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,840
And the security on this is gonna be

275
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,040
a little less than you would get

276
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,480
on a second mortgage.

277
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,920
You know, we had a lot of doors slammed

278
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,718
in our face.

279
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,600
But we had good people

280
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,320
on our team

281
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,200
and very good people

282
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,880
on the Morgan Stanley team at the time.

283
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,360
And we were able to get deals done.

284
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,520
And that set a trajectory for me,

285
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,400
for the business and for the industry.

286
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,440
Unbelievable.

287
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,480
And through Solar City,

288
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,480
did you ever cross parcels so with Elon

289
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,040
and get to hear a little bit

290
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,880
about his perspective

291
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,240
and how he sees the industry?

292
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,400
I did.

293
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,440
And Elon is a very bright guy.

294
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,600
Much more introverted than

295
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,400
his public persona on Twitter.

296
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,360
His Twitter, I was just about to say, yeah,

297
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,920
He's really an engineer.

298
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,560
Right.

299
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,440
And he sees what is possible

300
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,360
and then doesn't understand

301
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,360
why you go from what is possible to,

302
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,480
why can't you do it tomorrow?

303
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,960
Let's get this thing out there.

304
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,760
Let's push.

305
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,240
Because he started a PayPal.

306
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,760
He actually had a natural,

307
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,040
let's just say, dislike

308
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,200
or suspicion of banks.

309
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,760
Yeah.

310
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,480
He said basically,

311
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,000
you're gonna go to banks.

312
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,040
You're gonna explain this idea.

313
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,720
You're gonna explain to them

314
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,880
how they can make a lot of money

315
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,640
and they're not gonna know

316
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,800
what to do with this

317
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,040
or they're gonna try to steal your idea.

318
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,600
Right.

319
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,520
So, he's an incredibly bright guy.

320
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,920
And he was very supportive of

321
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,720
helping to steer the ship towards

322
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,360
a mass customer experience.

323
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,200
He just wants everything

324
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,400
done really quickly.

325
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,880
Perfectly.

326
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,480
Yeah.

327
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,760
And yesterday.

328
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,080
And as a result, the management style,

329
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,920
he gets a lot out of people.

330
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,880
And everybody who's worked

331
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,760
in an organization for him

332
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,960
for a period of time will tell you that

333
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,240
they contributed.

334
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,520
If they didn't contribute, they were out.

335
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,280
And they gave a lot of themselves.

336
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:31,400
And that's, I called it a management bonus

337
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,320
or a management characteristic.

338
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,520
You work really hard.

339
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,000
I mean, I think at the end

340
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,680
a lot of people are working on ventures,

341
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,560
and I'm thinking constantly about things

342
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,680
that I wanna do later on,

343
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,200
as an entrepreneur myself.

344
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,600
That's part of the motivation

345
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,720
for speaking to you here

346
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,880
and getting this inspiration.

347
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,920
At the end, when you're talking

348
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,880
about changing the world

349
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,520
and actually changing the world,

350
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,680
not writing that on a slide deck

351
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,160
and saying, "I'm gonna revolutionize XYZ."

352
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,960
But actually going and doing it.

353
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,000
You know, I think that at the end

354
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,080
you can forgive a little bit

355
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,040
of an offset in expenses myself,

356
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,960
but you can forgive a little bit

357
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,080
of hard work and a little bit of pushing

358
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,080
and the results are showing.

359
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,840
But, David I'm talking to you now

360
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,720
as a young entrepreneur.

361
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,800
I'm gonna go on my own path.

362
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,680
I'm gonna have to make some

363
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,840
difficult decisions on what I work on,

364
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,720
how I work on it and with who.

365
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,480
And I'd love to get a little bit of insight

366
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,480
into this world of renewable energy,

367
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,440
which you're an expert on by now.

368
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
What are some of the things

369
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,720
that are happening around the world

370
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,080
in this industry

371
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,840
that I should be aware of?

372
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,000
Because honestly,

373
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,480
it's not the sexiest thing

374
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,520
in the hallways of Stanford right now

375
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,040
and probably not in the lot of places

376
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,760
in the world.

377
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,200
So, let's talk about renewable energy.

378
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,280
Right. So, there's so many different ways

379
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,800
to start to answer that question.

380
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,240
Good. We have to we have about

381
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,120
seven minutes

382
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,120
so, we can talk about everything.

383
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,520
So we'll flow on advice

384
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,480
that's not a problem.

385
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,640
So, I am against of just separate

386
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,880
to the grid connected world

387
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,320
where we can improve our energy sources,

388
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,200
and the off grid world.

389
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,800
And there are, call it,

390
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,480
two billion people out there

391
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,880
in the world today

392
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,880
without reliable access to electricity.

393
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,560
Two billion without electricity.

394
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,440
Without reliable access.

395
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,240
Without reliable access to electricity.

396
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,240
So, and some without electricity at all.

397
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,080
But it's also the reliability.

398
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,715
If you have electricity

399
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,920
three or four hours a day,

400
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,960
that's a lot better than nothing.

401
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,040
But you still have have other needs.

402
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,640
So, I would start with the ability

403
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,280
to look at the world.

404
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,160
That is what we call off-grid

405
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,280
or semi off-grid and look at what it is

406
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,520
that can be done to bring electricity

407
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,400
and literally light to those people.

408
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,840
And that's maybe

409
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,640
250 million people in India

410
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,240
throughout Latin America and Africa.

411
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,280
And there's just, suburbs are

412
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,120
going to be very different.

413
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,240
They don't have all the appliances

414
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
because they don't have electricity,

415
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,280
obviously.

416
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,880
So, bringing in a light, having them also

417
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,680
on a pay as you go system,

418
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,640
I think is really terrific and important.

419
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,600
And whether that's the

420
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,360
lights for their house

421
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,840
or there in the village.

422
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:22,680
Whether it's a light

423
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,480
for their working place,

424
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,840
whether it's refrigeration,

425
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,040
being able to charge their cell phones.

426
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,360
Let me ask you this, David,

427
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,840
Is the problem,

428
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,720
so, we have electricity in many places

429
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,120
around the world.

430
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,820
And we have these systems.

431
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,320
Is the problem,

432
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,520
I want to know whether it's

433
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,760
the chicken or the egg problem?

434
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,680
Do we have the technology

435
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,440
and we just have to spend money

436
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,720
to scale it and implement it there?

437
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,280
Or are we looking for more

438
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,160
financially viable solutions,

439
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,960
more technologically savvy solutions

440
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,240
to make it more efficient?

441
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,720
And because we don't have them yet.

442
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,360
That's why we don't have electricity.

443
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,440
Which one is it?

444
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,360
So, for solar, for wind, for bio gas,

445
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,480
we have the technology today.

446
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,440
That is plenty good to be able to make us

447
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,320
much, much more energy independent.

448
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
We still have to evolve.

449
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,560
We still have to improve.

450
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,400
We still have to make inverters better.

451
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,280
We have to capture more hours

452
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,600
of sunlight in different ways,

453
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,280
Per square foot that you're using.

454
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,000
But the technology is there.

455
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,040
I think a second part of energy

456
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,040
is storing it.

457
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,120
So, you can have windmills tilt.

458
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,520
Wind turbines going all night long

459
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,480
offshore or in the Midwest.

460
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,480
But that's not where the demand is.

461
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,760
That's not where the load is.

462
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,600
So, you have to be able

463
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,120
to bring that somewhere.

464
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,160
And it's really good to have a,

465
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,040
you need storage and storage is coming.

466
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,080
It's here.

467
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,000
But the prices have to come down.

468
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,240
And just like in solar panel,

469
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,360
solar panels cost 10% of what they did

470
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,840
when I started over a decade ago.

471
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,360
They're 10% now.

472
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:02,960
And we're gonna get

473
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,160
the same thing with storage

474
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,240
and we're gonna get other system.

475
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,400
So I think,

476
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,840
Look, I'm MBA.

477
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,200
I'm not technical.

478
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,320
I wish I could develop

479
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,120
the next generation of solar panel

480
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,520
or a chemical reaction

481
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,240
that brings more energy better, faster.

482
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:19,880
That's not me.

483
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,960
That's a lot of smart people using AI

484
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,720
or other ways to invent the technologies

485
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,040
and improve the technologies.

486
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,000
I look at the world from a,

487
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,480
how do you get people to adapt?

488
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,880
What's the business model

489
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,520
that you can look at and says,

490
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,960
"I can get on one hand

491
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,840
the end user to adapt,

492
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,200
and on the other hand,

493
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,920
somebody to underwrite the risk

494
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,400
that technology will work

495
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,840
and that person will pay for it.

496
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,600
Why are there two billion people

497
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,520
without electricity

498
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,160
if we have solar, wind, water,

499
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,240
We have all these possibilities.

500
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,240
Why aren't we just spending

501
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,400
the billions necessary

502
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,720
and we are spending

503
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,800
the money on different things.

504
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,160
But why are we not spending them

505
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,920
on providing electricity?

506
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
What are we waiting for?

507
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,680
Is this policy issue,

508
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,920
a governmental bureaucracy issue?

509
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,640
Is this a technology issue?

510
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,400
I'd say it is 90%

511
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,920
government bureaucracy policy.

512
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:26,520
Not sending the grid into areas

513
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,960
that need the grid.

514
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,440
And if you go to these remote areas

515
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,550
that have democracy, for example,

516
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,310
you will often hear,

517
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,920
"Yes. The power grid is coming."

518
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,720
"Vote for me."

519
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,070
"I will get power to you."

520
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,720
"I will get electricity to you."

521
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
And every few years

522
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,640
when the election comes up,

523
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,790
the same types of promises are made.

524
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,440
But then there is not the follow through.

525
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,680
There's a technical challenge,

526
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,160
which is you have to run wires

527
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,310
and you have to build infrastructure.

528
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,030
And countries can do that.

529
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,550
And states or provinces can do that.

530
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,160
But it requires a level of discipline

531
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,440
and working through things.

532
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:08,440
And it's incredibly slow.

533
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,270
I mean, if you look at America,

534
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,480
we didn't have much electricity

535
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,200
a hundred years ago.

536
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,320
You know, we've got one of the

537
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,920
greatest grid in the world.

538
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,160
And that was done largely because

539
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:22,720
of policies and government support.

540
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,240
And I'm not saying that

541
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,840
we're in the same place

542
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,680
in these rural areas,

543
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,320
but there's so much more that can be done.

544
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,030
And I think business model evolution

545
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,350
is a part of what that is.

546
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,790
Right. It makes a lot of sensitivity.

547
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,320
After so many years in this industry,

548
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,160
what are you excited about today?

549
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,000
Tomorrow morning,

550
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,350
what are you gonna be working on

551
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,320
that really excites you.

552
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,310
New business models that basically take

553
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,160
policies, economics, incentives,

554
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,600
customer behavioral things.

555
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,680
We're working on some really

556
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,520
interesting things in New York City now

557
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,830
on community energy

558
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,240
and Ninedot Energy is leading the way.

559
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,400
And hopefully come September,

560
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,830
we will bring on

561
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,680
a seven and a half megawatt system,

562
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,880
which will bring 60 million

563
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,040
kilowatt hours a year

564
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,160
onto the grid for the next 25 years.

565
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,240
And our users will be

566
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,830
all over New York City.

567
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,800
And it's gonna support

568
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,550
the grid in unique ways.

569
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,030
So, I'm excited about.

570
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,680
And I'm also excited about more solar

571
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:32,030
and more electric vehicles,

572
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,270
Mopeds.

573
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,200
What is that?

574
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,320
What is a mopeds?

575
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,840
Electric mopeds like the rebel system,

576
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,400
which is just amazing.

577
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,640
Okay.

578
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,240
I love scooters and docking stations

579
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,480
like the one Swiftmile makes.

580
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,280
Yeah. Yeah.

581
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,640
It's just there's so much

582
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,350
cool stuff out there.

583
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,800
And in this covid area,

584
00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:00,030
we kind of see a lot of problems

585
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,240
and life is gonna change.

586
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,590
And one of this things might change is

587
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,960
how we use our vehicles

588
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,270
and what types of vehicles we use

589
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,440
and which streets are like.

590
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,160
And how much of our land

591
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,880
we end up using to park cars

592
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,070
and to move cars.

593
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,920
You know, one of the most difficult things,

594
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,680
and I'm looking at Tel Aviv,

595
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,680
I'm riding here my bike in Palo Alto

596
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,480
and it's beautiful.

597
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,960
There's a bike lane everywhere.

598
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,510
It's so wide and wonderful.

599
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,440
I go to Tel Aviv Yafo and we have

600
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,070
hundreds of scooters waiting to be ridden.

601
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,160
And I'm scared to death.

602
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,320
I want to ride a scooter.

603
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,680
I want to ride my bike in Tel Aviv,

604
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,640
but I can't.

605
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,830
But I do wanna ask though,

606
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,120
we're both a part of J-Ventures.

607
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,800
And so, we're looking at a bunch

608
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,750
of early stage companies.

609
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,960
Are we seeing an increase in companies

610
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,440
that are dealing with these problems

611
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,720
or is there a shortage of good talent

612
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,680
that is trying to work with electricity,

613
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,480
with mobility,

614
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,120
within renewable energy?

615
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,000
There's a lot of talent coming in.

616
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,750
There's a lot of talent in the field.

617
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,440
The key thing and the signals

618
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,400
are going to be

619
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,040
how will investors

620
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
look at these opportunities?

621
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,040
And I think we have seen

622
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,080
a lot of excitement on vehicles, on rebel

623
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,270
which I mentioned the scooter craze.

624
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,030
What happened?

625
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,440
You know, it was a bubble

626
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,160
from a valuation side,

627
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,920
but it also prove the point.

628
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,400
And then created the opportunities

629
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,520
for things like these docking station

630
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,680
for a recharging economy.

631
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,160
So, there will be electric vehicle

632
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,280
and not just electric vehicles,

633
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,350
autonomous vehicles,

634
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,240
cars that we could think of,

635
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,240
truck lines that go on various routes

636
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,880
and then can draft behind each other

637
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,440
in very short separation

638
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,000
and save on fuel costs.

639
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,700
From that water,

640
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,840
and it's not just electricity.

641
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,120
It's also on the water side

642
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,200
and other resources that actually

643
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,320
consume a ton of electricity.

644
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,790
But there's opportunities.

645
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,200
Hopefully the venture crowd

646
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,160
and the venture world

647
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,160
and they have a lot of mind to think,

648
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,160
in the venture world

649
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,760
that they follow each other.

650
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,040
And when the word gets out

651
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,350
that clean tech is great,

652
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,760
Like it was in the [--],

653
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,320
then there is a lot of investment.

654
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,240
And then all of a sudden the word got out.

655
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,350
It's tough. We don't know enough.

656
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,920
So, I think that's gonna happen.

657
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,440
What I'm really excited about now is

658
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,720
kind of the combination of

659
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,160
very large commitments by companies

660
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,400
to lower their carbon footprint

661
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,800
and things that would have taken

662
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,640
four years to get through committees

663
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,480
and processes

664
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,640
to do a power purchase agreement

665
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,310
for a solar farm or whatever.

666
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,720
Now, whoever runs energy there

667
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,200
they could show that it's a fair deal,

668
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,880
a good deal, they're saving on carbon

669
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,280
and they're saving money.

670
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,640
They can get those through.

671
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,040
And that combined with the things like

672
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,160
the Gates Foundation

673
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,120
and our breakthrough energy

674
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,110
and other major foundations,

675
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,070
the Rockefeller family.

676
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,720
Folks who are saying,

677
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,160
"What got us here won't get us there."

678
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,960
And we're heading

679
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:23,520
from a climate side is disastrous.

680
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,400
We know this and,

681
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,120
but there's a lot of fund solutions out there.

682
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,480
And whether it's just high tech

683
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,070
and can develop something big,

684
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,160
or figure out a better model

685
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,520
for the scooters, how to move scooters,

686
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,240
how to build lanes for the scooters,

687
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,760
how to signal.

688
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,360
The one thing I'd love to throw out there

689
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,960
for the world that we need desperately

690
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,600
is a cheap, dispensable

691
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,520
or disposable helmet.

692
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,440
It comes with every scooter ride

693
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,480
and every little bike rental in the city.

694
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,720
That happens because people like you,

695
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,960
like me go on Tel Aviv,

696
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,520
we go on these scooters

697
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,840
and we are less of taxi

698
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,400
than we know we should be.

699
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,520
I completely agree.

700
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,040
David, I need three words

701
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,280
that you would use to describe yourself.

702
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,520
Three words to describe myself.

703
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,760
Adventurous.

704
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,110
I love new adventures.

705
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,640
It's why I'm an entrepreneur.

706
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,880
And it's why I get to live

707
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,000
in different parts of the world.

708
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,920
This is a hyphenated word, Values driven.

709
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,120
Okay. Sure.

710
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,960
I do things that are consistent

711
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,760
with the values and work with people

712
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,160
who are consistent with the values

713
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,760
that I hold.

714
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,560
And Indomitable.

715
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,550
You may not know that word.

716
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,550
I don't.

717
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,040
I don't know the word in Hebrew,

718
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:58,070
But indomitable is

719
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,830
It's what entrepreneurs need to be.

720
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,240
They don't see at what age

721
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,280
as something that is insurmountable.

722
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,360
You keep going.

723
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,480
You keep working.

724
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,240
You try this way.

725
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,160
You try that way.

726
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,550
I love it.

727
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,840
And my friend Rich Kelly

728
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,400
gave me that name.

729
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,590
And I like indomitable.

730
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,200
So, there we go.

731
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,000
I love it.

732
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,160
David, thank you very much.

733
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,760
Toda raba.

734
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,800
Thank you for the inspiration.

735
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,520
Thank you for the work you're doing.

736
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,790
Toda raba Michael.This is a pleasure.

737
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,760
[--]

738
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,520
Toda raba. Bye bye.

739
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:31,920
Bye bye.
