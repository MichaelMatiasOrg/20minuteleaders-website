00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,280
Gideon Intrater, thank you so much

2
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,720
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,400
Thank you.

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,160
Thanks. It's good to be here.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,840
So, we're gonna talk

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,960
about metal today, right?

7
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:32,600
Bare metal.

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,960
Bare metal.

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,390
Gideon, you know,

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,560
as a young entrepreneur,

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,360
going through Stanford here in Palo Alto,

12
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,400
we see all the sexy things on the news

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,560
and all these new and shiny devices

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,920
and really really cool things

15
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,040
but sometimes I think

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,320
we forget to look back

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,400
and really the core

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,280
of what's happening

19
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,790
and the core of technology,

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,280
which you've been dealing with

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,640
for quite some time now

22
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,960
in VP engineering positions

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,000
and CTO positions.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Let's talk about metal.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,560
But first, Gidy, tell me a little bit

26
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,880
about where you come from.

27
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:07,200
Okay. So, I've been a CTO architect

28
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,720
pretty much my whole career.

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,560
I've started way way back in Israel

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,800
and was heading the

31
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,880
computer architecture team

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,560
at National Semiconductor.

33
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,920
Moved to the US with ... worked

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,920
for a good number of years

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,120
for another CPU company

36
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,800
called MIPS Technologies.

37
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,160
And until this morning,

38
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,560
I was working at the

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,040
semiconductor company called Adesto

40
00:01:34,045 --> 00:01:35,800
which today was acquired

41
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,480
by a different semiconductor company called -

42
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:39,860
Mazel Tov.

43
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:40,520
Dialog Semiconductor.

44
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,320
Thank you very much.

45
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,880
Yeah, we're all happy about it.

46
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,120
You're saying it so casually.

47
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,520
Really, mazel tov.

48
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,280
Yeah. Thank you.

49
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,080
How many acquisitions

50
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,240
of this now have you been a part of?

51
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,920
Oh, a good number of acquisitions.

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,640
There's a lot of stuff that's happening

53
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,000
in the semiconductor business.

54
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,320
Now it's not as visible

55
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,560
as the software business

56
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,080
or the apps business,

57
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,440
but a lot of things are happening.

58
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,400
I was at MIPS and it was acquired.

59
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,480
I was consulting a number of startups

60
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:13,120
that were a bunch of them were acquired

61
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
and now this company that I'm in

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,720
was the deal was closed this morning.

63
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,040
Unbelievable.

64
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,520
Gideon, why is this not in the news?

65
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,960
I mean, this is obviously in the news.

66
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,200
You just have to look a little bit deeper

67
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,000
than another autonomous

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,880
vehicle company being acquired.

69
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,520
But why is bare metal

70
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,000
not in the headlines?

71
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,360
Well, first you just don't read

72
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:38,040
the correct sources of media, right

73
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,360
That's 100% true.

74
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:46,560
Well, it's not as sexy as software.

75
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,800
It takes us much longer to get

76
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,520
to an exit in this business.

77
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,640
This business requires

78
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,680
significantly higher investments.

79
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,760
So, two people in their garage

80
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,960
cannot really get a company to an exit

81
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,200
within a couple of years.

82
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,160
That doesn't happen.

83
00:03:05,161 --> 00:03:06,920
Adesto, which is the company

84
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,320
that I was a part of

85
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,520
has been around for 13 years

86
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,000
before it was acquired

87
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,080
about eight, nine years

88
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,840
before it went public.

89
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,560
Wow.

90
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,560
So, it takes much much longer.

91
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,200
And the problem is we're building

92
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,360
semiconductor devices,

93
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,520
you call it bare metal,

94
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,120
but what we're doing is

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,880
designing semiconductor chips

96
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,880
that are pretty much the baseline

97
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:32,560
for pretty much all the software

98
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:35,760
that's being used in the world.

99
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,800
And we have to do a lot of things

100
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,400
to make this happen

101
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,160
and it just takes time and money.

102
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,320
Okay. So, let's dumb it down for me

103
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,680
because I know nothing about this.

104
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,840
What is the semiconductor business?

105
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,320
What are these technologies?

106
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,880
What are you building

107
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,960
on a day by day basis?

108
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,920
So, it depends.

109
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,800
Different companies are

110
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,840
building different things.

111
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,480
Everybody knows about Intel

112
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,400
which is building the CPUs

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,680
that are driving the PCs.

114
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,520
And now Apple is gonna be building

115
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,320
their own CPU that's gonna drive

116
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,200
the new Mac machines.

117
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:10,440
So, these are the things

118
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,320
that are typically much more in the news.

119
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,280
Then there's another tier of companies

120
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,440
that are building products

121
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,680
that go into cell phones.

122
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,240
So, a lot of people know about Qualcomm

123
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,560
and other such providers

124
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,840
But then you go deeper,

125
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,880
and for example the business

126
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
that we're a part of

127
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,120
which is the industrial IOT,

128
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,000
these devices are done

129
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,680
by a whole bunch of smaller companies.

130
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,680
And most of them

131
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,120
you just don't have a clue

132
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,920
that these devices are sitting

133
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,560
within your printer

134
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,520
or your food processor or -

135
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,560
We're literally talking

136
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,400
about the chips.

137
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:53,160
The chips that are in almost everything

138
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,880
that we see in our day to day right now.

139
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,400
Exactly.

140
00:04:55,405 --> 00:04:58,400
And many of them include CPUs inside.

141
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,200
So, a lot of them at the end of the day,

142
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
are running software.

143
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,360
So, there's a lot of design

144
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,680
that goes into these systems.

145
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,920
First building the chip

146
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,600
then building the software around it.

147
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,440
So, even the software people

148
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,880
that are building the software

149
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,720
that goes into that.
I'm not in the news

150
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,000
nobody knows about them.

151
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,440
but that's what actually

152
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,520
is driving your car

153
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,120
and that's what driving pretty much

154
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:21,760
every one of these devices

155
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,560
that you're buying at Amazon.

156
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:26,520
Right. That's just incredible.

157
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,520
And take me back a few years

158
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,800
because you've been in this space

159
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,920
for quite some time.

160
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,560
And I grew up into a world that

161
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,640
IOT, Internet of Things devices,

162
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
are prevalent

163
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,000
and almost everything I touch

164
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:41,480
has a brain of its own.

165
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,920
But I think when you started

166
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,840
in this industry,

167
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,920
it wasn't like this, right?

168
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,720
No, no, no, no, no.

169
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,400
I've been in this business about 30 years.

170
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,000
And even at that time,

171
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,600
computers were relatively scarce.

172
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,040
There was typically a car had

173
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,040
one processor that was controlling

174
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,680
the engine and that was it.

175
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,120
Today, a car will have

176
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,120
tens and tens of microprocessors

177
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,240
that are doing everything

178
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,360
from rolling the windows down all the way

179
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,320
to showing you the way.

180
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,000
Even a cell phone has a number

181
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,640
of microprocessors inside

182
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,920
dealing with different functionality.

183
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,720
So, there's microprocessors

184
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:23,920
practically anywhere

185
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,760
and most of them are hidden.

186
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,600
Most of the people don't even know.

187
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:30,520
And this, what the Internet of things

188
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,640
is doing today

189
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
is what used to be called in the past,

190
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
embedded systems

191
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:37,080
which were systems where the software

192
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,760
was deep inside.

193
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,960
Nobody knew that about this software.

194
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,240
It was just done by whoever

195
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,520
built the system.

196
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,400
But there was no way

197
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,760
to update or upgrade it.

198
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,920
Now, with the Internet of Things,

199
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,240
pretty much all these pieces

200
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,240
are capable of being upgraded

201
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,600
and updated over time

202
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,960
which makes it beautiful.

203
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,600
It allows you to add features

204
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,840
later in time.

205
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,040
TESLA made a whole business

206
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,680
of upgrading your car pretty much

207
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,240
after you actually bought it

208
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,080
which is something that was unheard of

209
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,280
in the car industry before.

210
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,880
Incredible. So, what is there to come?

211
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,680
Because it seems that now

212
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,560
everything is already connected

213
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,920
and everything is pretty much

214
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,360
communicating with itself.

215
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,640
So, what are the big milestones

216
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,600
that we can foresee

217
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,280
in the next few decades?

218
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,040
The big thing that's happening right now

219
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,400
is actually taking AI

220
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,440
and driving it all

221
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,120
the way to the edge of the network.

222
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:37,720
So, the camera in your in your door

223
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,000
will actually be able to figure out

224
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,600
whether it's you or somebody else.

225
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,600
So, and a whole bunch

226
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,280
of other applications

227
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,680
where the knowledge to know

228
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,080
how the processing power,

229
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,880
whether extended processing power

230
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,360
or even AI will all be

231
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,800
at the end of the network,

232
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
the edge of the network,

233
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,440
without the need to go back to the servers

234
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,000
and make decisions and do that

235
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,000
requires first for you to be connected,

236
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,360
and second there's latency.

237
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,600
You don't want stuff

238
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,760
to go up to the network

239
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:11,160
and you don't really want Amazon

240
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,440
to actually take all the words

241
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,360
that are being said

242
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,560
within your living room

243
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,040
and send them up to their server.

244
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,400
You want to get the service,

245
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,400
but you want it to be done locally

246
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,960
without Amazon actually

247
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,240
getting that information

248
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,760
and storing it on their server.

249
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,760
So, a lot of this intelligence coming down

250
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,640
right to the edge of the network

251
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,280
will make a big change in the way

252
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,040
these devices are operating.

253
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,000
Right. So, and it sounds to me that

254
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,840
there are some hidden difficulties

255
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
or hidden challenges

256
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,440
that a software engineer like myself

257
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,080
may not even realize

258
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,760
because I could be developing

259
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,400
artificial intelligence models

260
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,400
pretty easily

261
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,240
either using AutoML by Google

262
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,200
or just TensorFlow with Python or PyTorch.

263
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,080
But it sounds like what you're saying

264
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,000
is that the challenges

265
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:02,720
of running these models on device,

266
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,400
on the camera that's on the door

267
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,760
is not just the software.

268
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,480
There's a lot of the processing power

269
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,480
and the memory,

270
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,440
those are all challenges

271
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,240
that we're still facing today.

272
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,280
Right. I can't afford to put

273
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,960
a server farm in my house.

274
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,400
So, you have to figure, we have to figure

275
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,280
out ways to make these algorithms

276
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,320
more efficient, to make

277
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,560
the hardware more efficient

278
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,040
so it would be able to run it.

279
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,040
In many cases,

280
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,560
you need to be running it

281
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,600
with a limited amount of energy.

282
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,960
For example, the battery operated devices.

283
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,440
So there's a lot of innovation

284
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,920
that's going on right now

285
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,640
into building devices

286
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,840
that are smarter and capable

287
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,160
of doing these smart things at the edge

288
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,840
with the limitations of cost, power

289
00:09:45,845 --> 00:09:49,200
and pretty much everything else

290
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,640
that is what you expect

291
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:54,160
at the end of the day to have

292
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,520
in your right next to your front door.

293
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,000
Definitely.

294
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,280
So, the things that you're building,

295
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,120
are these the challenges

296
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,240
that you're working on,

297
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,840
making these things possible?

298
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,400
Yeah. We're working on AI at the edge.

299
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,600
We're also working

300
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,040
on security at the edge.

301
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,120
So, all these devices need to be secured

302
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,480
and you really wanna make sure

303
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,680
that nobody manages

304
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,400
to penetrate in your house,

305
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,760
into your bank account,

306
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:27,320
through your connected fan, right?

307
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,040
So, there's a lot of work

308
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,400
that's being done in these areas as well.

309
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:31,920
Yeah. I believe that

310
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,840
it was, somebody shared with me a paper

311
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,560
from the Technion

312
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,200
of a couple of people who managed

313
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,720
to actually hack a ceiling fan

314
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:41,040
and get some personal data

315
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,480
about people through that.

316
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,960
Right. Right. Right.

317
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,080
Pretty fascinating.

318
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,200
So, what excites you about this?

319
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,680
I mean, this does sound exciting now

320
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,240
that you're explaining what it allows.

321
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,840
But at the end, you're not working

322
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,720
on the camera of Ring

323
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,160
and you're not working on the ceiling fan.

324
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,960
You're working on the technologies

325
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,120
that then companies can use

326
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,000
to make their IOT, right?

327
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,800
Right. But what's happening

328
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,160
is that the engineering companies

329
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,880
that are building the end product

330
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,040
are becoming trying to become

331
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,200
leaner and leaner.

332
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,560
And what happens is that

333
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,880
the semiconductor vendors

334
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,960
that are offering devices

335
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,920
to these applications

336
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:27,440
are providing significantly more software

337
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,160
and more of the application

338
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,240
within the device, within their offering.

339
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,760
If you look today at TV, for example,

340
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,040
the chip that's actually controlling the TV

341
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,320
comes from a vendor that provides

342
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,160
not just the chip,

343
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,640
but the operating system

344
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,120
and a lot of the software.

345
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,520
At the end of the day, the various OEMs,

346
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,040
the main difference

347
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,720
between their devices would be

348
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,880
just the brand name on that

349
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,200
pops up when you turn on the TV.

350
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,080
Could easily be that 90% of the software

351
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,400
is the same software that was built

352
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:06,160
or provided by the semiconductor vendor.

353
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,400
So, semiconductor vendors

354
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,760
are actually becoming much more

355
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,480
of a vertically integrated suppliers

356
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,160
of a lot of the software

357
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,600
and a lot of the solution.

358
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,920
We're providing these devices.

359
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,520
We're providing the software.

360
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,000
We're providing even boards

361
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:25,080
that include all the pieces together.

362
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,600
And then in many cases,

363
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,640
OEMs in China and in Taiwan

364
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,480
would just take these designs and

365
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,560
pretty much take them to production.

366
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,200
Fascinating.

367
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,040
And are there demographic shifts

368
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,480
that you're seeing in the industry

369
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,000
in terms of young people coming into it?

370
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,120
Because I'm just thinking about

371
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,800
my experience at Stanford.

372
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,760
It's much sexier to go into software

373
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,000
and just use Python to write these

374
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,200
machine learning code.

375
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,960
And honestly, most of the companies

376
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,400
that are coming to hire on campus,

377
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,840
that's what they're looking for.

378
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,120
I don't remember a single company

379
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,640
that came that had stand out and said,

380
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,480
"Come work with us

381
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,680
in the semiconductor industry."

382
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,320
So, what's happening with that?

383
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,480
Well, our industry

384
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,800
is actually becoming older.

385
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,480
You go and visit the offices

386
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,720
and you'll see people that are

387
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,080
slightly older than the people

388
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:19,040
that you would see at typical Google site.

389
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,675
Right.

390
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,760
Yeah, that's true.

391
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,880
Although we're still getting

392
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,920
a lot of young engineers,

393
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,560
there is a shift of engineering

394
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:33,760
from the US into other places where people

395
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,640
value the semiconductor business more.

396
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,680
So, you'll see tons of startups in China.

397
00:13:39,681 --> 00:13:40,480
Really?

398
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,520
You'll still see a bunch of startups

399
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,720
coming up in Israel.

400
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh, yeah.

401
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,760
By the way, why was Israel a hub

402
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,320
or is still a hub for this?

403
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,560
Why is that?

404
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,640
That's a good story.

405
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,440
It has to do with multiple

406
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:57,920
different things,

407
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,720
but one of them was Intel.

408
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,280
Intel came to Israel in 1974

409
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,880
and started the design center.

410
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:09,360
And then within a few years,

411
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,320
engineers from Intel start moving

412
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,440
to other companies they thought

413
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,280
that'll have better opportunities

414
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,120
with still with American companies.

415
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,440
So, Motorola and National Semiconductor

416
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,120
started design centers.

417
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,320
But then in the late '80s,

418
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,840
people started realizing

419
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,000
that there's opportunities with startups

420
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,040
and money came in.

421
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,600
A lot of people got to a, pretty much

422
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,920
a glass ceiling in terms of

423
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,320
as a subsidiary of a big American company,

424
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,280
you couldn't get any further.

425
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,800
So, what happened was that,

426
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,440
and money was relatively abundant.

427
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,040
And so, startups started

428
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,440
and I can tell you that in the early 2000s,

429
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,920
Israel was probably more startups

430
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,040
than practically any place in the world,

431
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,880
maybe with the exception of Silicon Valley.

432
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,320
Even now, I think there are more

433
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,160
semiconductor startups in Israel

434
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,360
than practically anywhere in the world.

435
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,440
It's not the same numbers as they were

436
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,040
in the early 2000s,

437
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,680
but it's still a huge number.

438
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,320
So, it's not that it was more common

439
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,560
just to go to the Technion

440
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,000
and study the space.

441
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,840
It was more so that the industry by chance

442
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,280
came to Israel in 1974,

443
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,840
people saw the opportunity

444
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,080
and it got everybody excited?

445
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,120
Yeah. It was an exciting business.

446
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,000
Think about it, at that time

447
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,520
the other businesses were mostly

448
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:38,040
build boxes for ...

449
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:39,500
Yeah.

450
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:44,000
So people, some of the top people in the industry

451
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,040
or actually the top students

452
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,000
out of the Technion, went to work

453
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,960
for Intel, National, and Motorola.

454
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:53,480
At the time, I remember

455
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:56,360
I joined a little bit later than that,

456
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,880
much later than that

457
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,440
about 15 years later.

458
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,560
But at the time,

459
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,680
for every job at National,

460
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,080
we had about 100 people

461
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,215
that were applying.

462
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:06,133
Wow.

463
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:07,800
And we definitely rejected people

464
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,280
that were extremely good.

465
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,400
Some of them are CEOs of companies

466
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,840
that exited with millions

467
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
and millions of dollars.

468
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,480
And we told them,

469
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,160
"No, you're not a fit for working for us."

470
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,840
We could just pick whoever we wanted

471
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,160
to work at the company.

472
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,680
Unbelievable. And is there now,

473
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,920
is there a scarcity in good engineers

474
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,080
in the semiconductor space?

475
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,720
I think there's always been scarcity

476
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,120
in terms of good engineers.

477
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,400
Good engineers are not growing on trees

478
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,560
and it's always been a challenge

479
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,560
and now there's definitely

480
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,720
a bigger challenge due to the fact

481
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,920
that there's a lot of people

482
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,680
that are going to other businesses.

483
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,360
And I don't think that the universities

484
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,120
are generating enough engineers,

485
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:55,120
neither in the US nor in Israel.

486
00:16:55,121 --> 00:16:57,600
Right. And it's interesting to hear

487
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,800
that there's, it seems that

488
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,840
there is a shift to Asia

489
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,480
for a lot of these businesses

490
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,840
as opportunities are rising.

491
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,880
And I'm really curious to know

492
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,680
about leadership

493
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,720
in the semiconductor space.

494
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,720
I talked to quite a few executives

495
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,680
and leadership positions

496
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,720
in the software space where I'm at.

497
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,560
What is it like leading technology and

498
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,680
leading teams in the semiconductor space

499
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,280
from your experience?

500
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,040
Is that different

501
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,160
than in the software space

502
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,510
or are these sort of two similar animals?

503
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,400
I think they're pretty similar animals.

504
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,440
There is obviously a little bit

505
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,720
of a difference in terms

506
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,510
of what you need to achieve -

507
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,280
Right. Also the length of time

508
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,880
that it takes to come to production.

509
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,790
Right? I mean, it takes years versus months.

510
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,310
There's also the risk.

511
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,440
Software doesn't have to be perfect

512
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,920
when it comes out of the factory.

513
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,790
You can update it and upgrade it,

514
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,800
and people invented this model of

515
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:51,200
let the customer

516
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,550
debug my code.

517
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,840
You can't do that with semiconductor.

518
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,040
With semiconductor, you take the chip out,

519
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,030
meaning you take it to production.

520
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,160
And then if you have a bug,

521
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,520
it will take you about six months

522
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,550
to fix that bug.

523
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,040
So, and the cost of fixing that bug

524
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,360
could be hundreds of thousands

525
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,750
or could be millions of dollars.

526
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,720
So, you can't really afford

527
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,590
to have bugs.

528
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,920
So, the result is that

529
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:15,760
the complexity of semiconductor devices

530
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,440
is not as big as a complexity

531
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,070
of a big software system where

532
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,040
there's hundreds of people working

533
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,200
on the same project.

534
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,840
I think the biggest projects are

535
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,110
Intel's microprocessors, probably

536
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,270
one or two thousand people

537
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,000
working on the program.

538
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,000
Most programs are much much smaller

539
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,720
with tens or hundreds of people.

540
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:45,320
But, so I think at the end of the day,

541
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,840
software systems could be

542
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,520
significantly more complex

543
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,960
and more difficult to manage,

544
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,030
however they manage it to just operate

545
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,040
not be bug free

546
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,320
where in the semiconductor business,

547
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,000
you have to figure out a way

548
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,400
to make it bug free.

549
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,040
And the result was a lot of tools

550
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:08,520
that were designed to help the engineers

551
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,510
actually figure out ways to clean the bugs.

552
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,800
Bugs are always in error,

553
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,480
and you just need to figure out a way

554
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,400
to get most or all of them out

555
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,480
of the design before you roll it out.

556
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,030
I mean it sounds pretty scary.

557
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,520
You've got to experience quite a few

558
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,350
roll-outs and deployments of these chips.

559
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,040
I mean, you deploy them and you're like,

560
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,550
"Okay. We did our thing.

561
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,200
I guess we're working on the next thing

562
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,840
And let's just hope that we don't wake up

563
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,240
and see an article that says

564
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,320
that there is a huge bug

565
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,640
in one of our chips."

566
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,550
Yeah. Yeah.

567
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,160
Well, you've seen what happened to Intel

568
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,400
with some of these security bugs.

569
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,400
This is a disaster.

570
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,720
The number of chips that are deployed

571
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,080
and the time that it was found,

572
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,760
which was in some cases

573
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,750
years after the chips went to the market.

574
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,030
And now, what do you do about it?

575
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,200
So, in many cases

576
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,640
you find some work arounds.

577
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,400
Some of them are reducing

578
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,919
the performance of the device

579
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,159
and some of them

580
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,680
are not completely foolproof

581
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,440
and you have to live with it.

582
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,520
I think I recall that

583
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,080
there is an interesting case study

584
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,600
from one of my business school classes

585
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,750
of a time when a chip, it was found that

586
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,200
once every million calculations

587
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,550
it had a miscalculation error, right.

588
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,880
And it was a huge deal

589
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,040
of how does the company,

590
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,550
do they collect all the chips back?

591
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
But you can't because they're already

592
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
in all the computers.

593
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,200
And it was fascinating.

594
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,790
Right. Right. Right. Yeah.

595
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,240
It's a huge huge problem.

596
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,320
And there's tons of money

597
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,510
that's involved in that

598
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,560
both for the semiconductor vendor

599
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,760
that's building the chip

600
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,680
and for the OEM that sells it

601
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,960
at the end of the day.

602
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,960
Not an easy problem to deal with.

603
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,920
I think it takes a lot of courage to go

604
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
and sell something to millions of people

605
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,000
and hope that nobody finds anything wrong.

606
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,680
Hey, it's much easier than being

607
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,600
a structural engineer that's responsible

608
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,920
for a bridge that falls,

609
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,160
or a doctor that is

610
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,750
actually doing surgeries.

611
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,600
It's all relative.

612
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:09,160
On the spectrum it's not that bad.

613
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,920
I love it. Okay.

614
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,240
Gideon, right before we leave,

615
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,520
I wanna thank again for the time

616
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,200
that you're giving this.

617
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,000
And we didn't even talk about.

618
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,790
I'm very curious, I mean you're also part of J-Ventures

619
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,350
as a limited partner there.

620
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,040
So you're also active with

621
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,960
early stage startups

622
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,320
and you're active also

623
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,000
in helping do due diligence

624
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
and I love that you're balancing

625
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:29,080
these two worlds very technological,

626
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,830
yet also on the investment side.

627
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,960
But before we leave,

628
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,480
I have to ask three words

629
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,360
that you would use to describe yourself.

630
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,480
Okay. So, I would say

631
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,550
innovative problem solver.

632
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,240
That's probably

633
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,400
the easiest way to describe myself.

634
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,960
Innovative problem solver.

635
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,310
I love it.

636
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,480
It's all about solving problems

637
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,680
in the end, isn't it?

638
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,480
Yeah.

639
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,040
I love it.

640
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,240
Gideon, thank you very much.

641
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,240
Toda raba.

642
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,720
And congratulations on the

643
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,590
acquisition from today morning.

644
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,200
Yup.

645
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,350
Amazing. Amazing.

646
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,160
All right. Take care.

647
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,070
Bye bye.

648
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,440
Bye bye.
