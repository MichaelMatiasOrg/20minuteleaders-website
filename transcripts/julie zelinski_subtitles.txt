Wonderful. Okay. Julie Zelenski, thank you so much for being on my show. How are you? Good, thank you. It seems just like a few months ago we were back in the lab working in CS107A. Don't remind me. Those are the good old days. That was a great quarter. How was it online this past quarter? Well, I think, for CS professors, it was maybe, we had one of the easier jobs. Because we already do a lot of our delivery. [--] We do a lot of students watching via video and time shifted and stuff. So, and so much of our expertise is in building tools and online circumstances, it turns out. So we were able to adapt. We had an office hour cue. Let's say that we ran off of the Web. Your average Latin professor, I bet, did not find it as easy a transition to move from their traditional in classroom way of doing stuff to this or like the sciences, where you have all kinds of physical activity. So, I think we did a pretty good job in terms of transition. Our class was twice as big as we allow it to be. Which, I think indicated the students also both in with their feet in terms of, where can I make progress and work on my degree in this time of turmoil. And so, we had a lot of people showing up and see us, I think, as if it felt like a safe place to make some good progress. I'm very curious to see what the trends are going to look like, now that it's transitioning online and what people's choices are going to make. But nothing will ever be able to replace the incredible mentorship that you and Pat provided, at least me and my cohort. Coming into the breadboard and physically showing us otherwise. I don't think it will ever be able to replace that. No matter how great we'll make virtual be. But Julie, I want to go back to by your journey. One of the most popular computer science professors within Stanford. A renowned teacher. You love teaching, and at the same time, you love code. Back at NeXT, and then Apple. Experience with Steve Jobs. And I want to capture everything in this talk. And it's going to be impossible. But we're going to start. Julie, who are you? Take me through your journey. How do you come to be one of the top teachers and lecturers at Stanford after an incredible career? It's all master plan I've known since day one. No. I came at Stanford myself as an undergrad, from a rural public California high school. I think without a lot of exposure to computers or the field, or any of it. I was a math undergrad, in fact, all the way through. And, I picked up a little computer science late. I thought it was really neat, but it wasn't yet obvious to me how this was going to lead to just one step after another. You take one class, you like it. You take another one. You think it's a fluke. But I do pretty well that I liked it a lot, but I'm sure it gets a lot harder. But you keep making the progress. I ended up at NeXT. Next was just getting started when I was an undergrad. And so, at that point they were still in the educational market. So, there was a lot of attention at the university level. And so, I worked with an actual NeXT employee who would come to Stanford to teach this class, right, on how the NeXT was programmed. Which, I thought was super interesting. And it just totally caught my fancy. Like the IT. I do internship programming at that point. It was relatively new. And when you saw the way it enabled certain problems to get solved like that, it's so freaking cool. And Julie, I want to talk about that. Why is it so freaking cool when the software is written well? Yeah. Because, I mean, like, when you start to write code, you realize, like, there are parts of it that are tedious. Like, Oh, you're writing the same code again and again. The idea that figuring out ways to capture that idiom, that commonality and unify it, and debug it, and put it in a library, and reuse it again, is just such a huge leverage point for which you can then go on to build and solve more interesting problems. So, yeah. You're running a link list. Sure. Everybody needs to learn this as part of their etude of computer science. But in the end, what you really want to be doing is solving these problems. You're like, Oh, I want to be looking at this data and teasing out these trends and figure out how to do this. Or, it's like, Okay, I don't need to solve these problems anymore about a hash [--]. Well, hash [--] it's super awesome and it's wonderful. But somebody needs to build a really awesome sorting. Which in a really awesome hash table, a really awesome graphics and systems. A 3D rendering engine. And then, we all get to build on top of that. Like starting on the 10th floor of our 20 story building. Or the 99th floor, or skyscraper. And so, the idea of figuring out ways, our tools, and our libraries, and our systems, can promote reuse, right? And so we talk about it early in the sequence. We're always talking about the design, and structure. Julie, you have an incredible responsibility, not just as a computer science faculty member within Stanford, but you actually teach often the huge introductory classes as well. Like [--] and computer science. And this is really an introduction for a lot of students into the breadth of the complexity behind problem solving for computer science. What is that like to have the responsibility of having 400 students in an auditorium? And Julie, one of the first team members and instructors they meet? I mean, computer science is so awesome because the fact, that even in that first class or second class, you're really in the mid of it. There isn't this really long prerequisite chain where you have to spend a lot of time, sort of, I think, on the background material before you can get going and do something interesting. It's like from day one, in our CS106A courses, we're solving little problems. It's like, Okay. Maybe it's the robot. It's a little bit of a simplified world. But you're thinking logically. You're thinking about repetition, and if else logic, and how you break things down into [--] units. And it's like, every step along the way is an opportunity to learn a little bit more of good engineering practice. And so, it's like at the end of those first two quarters, you have learned a lot that's actually very practical and can immediately you can turn around and start writing stuff and building stuff, and doing stuff with it. People are going off to work, to do internships at Google and Facebook after taking this course. It's just, it's so accessible to everyone. And that's so extraordinary, right? I mean, I'm not a chemist, or a biologist, or physicist, but I feel like there's really long chain before you're able to do something with, let's say, chemistry, that where you're really going to put it in the practice. And CS, it's like such a neat steep ramp from, I know nothing, to I can actually do some pretty neat things in such a short period of time. That's really awesome place to be. So then, what is your idea, your vision and also Stanford's in terms of, how do you get somebody who comes in and says, "I want to learn computer science within this incredible institution, Stanford." How can you best prepare me over the next four years to be the greatest thinker, problem solver that I can be? Because there's a very clear mindset into this logical sequence that we take. And I'm in it right now and I'm loving it. I'm so impressed by how well thought out it is. Talk to me a little bit about that. It's totally a team effort. I mean, I think, we have a very strong curriculum design committee. that is in place for the long haul. And we're constantly looking at our offerings and the result. One thing that's a little bit different about Stanford, relative to other R1 institution is that we do have what we call Ed Group, the ED Affairs Group, when there are 10 of us. And that we are teaching only faculty. And so, the intro sequence CS106, and 109 and 107, 108, one like that, are taught by this group of lecturers and teaching faculty. And that means that, we give 100% of our heart and soul to making sure that the intro sequence, and the [--] are taught. Yeah. And then, as you transition out of intro and into the upper division, so, you start to hit compilers, and machine learning, and graphics and stuff like that. And so, you'll encounter the traditional research faculty. So, someone like Pat. Pat, and most of us, are also people who are very interested and care about teaching a lot. But they're also have an extremely rich and amazing career as a researcher, which necessarily means that their attention is going to be split a little bit more. And they have more attention placed on mentoring grad students and whatnot. So, us being there to make sure that we do a ton of teacher mentoring, we do a bunch of training, we bring our undergraduates in to work with us in the intro sequence, which gives us a pipeline of people to step up to be graduate TAs. Julie, how do you improve on this process? Because you teach a class of 400 students. You've just taught it for 10 weeks. And now, you have a one week break and you're about to teach it again. And as any good computer scientist, you want to improve and learn for the next generation. So, how do you go about doing that? Well, everything I work on, you can ask anybody who's gone behind me will tell you that in the directory with the files, like the code or the write up, or the rubric, or any of the materials software, there's a file under whose name is called, For Next Time. It's in all capital and is always name the same thing. But I put it right there. Like it's right by the lecture, it's right by the section, it's right by the lab. And it reminds me of, as we were doing it, what was happening, What there something that students got tripped up on it? Was there something the TAs told me about it? Was there something I just felt coming out of the lecture? Or, if I got a chance to review the lecture itself, like, Oh, you know, what? That just wasn't that clear. Or, I need a different example. And I make those myself. And I leave them, it's the one place I'll remember it. If I put it anywhere else, it's not going to be where I am. So, at the point where I'm preparing that lecture up and start with the last time I had it, I'll be like, Oh, look, what I wrote down. This example fell flat, or this needs to be fixed. We need to fix this explanation, whatever. So, they're littered throughout everything I worked on. So, it has to be there. You're right. I mean, everything is so in the moment for teaching, it's a thousand little to do items of this week's lecture, this week's assignment, this week's lab, that exam. So, that you need a system to keep each of them. And then, I'd say bigger things. Like if you're thinking really about restructuring an entire class, or really doing something like that is generally going to be something that we work on more as a team. Like there's a much bigger let's all get together, let's all brainstorm, let's all think about whether we like it. We recently switched our 106A course, which has been a JAVA for 10 years, to Python. And that was a huge effort of a lot of people to survey what other schools are doing. Look at tools that are out there. Looking at ways that would change our pedagogy. Look at the way it's going to affect other parts of our curriculum. How long have you been teaching these monumental classes within Stanford? So, I've been here since 1992. Wow. So, what changed since then? You've seen quite a few students go by. Is it different than other? In some ways it feels like nothing's changed. Because the core of it, it's still is beautiful, and it's pristine, and heartfelt as it ever was. Which is, I mean I would say, one of the things that's really important about Stanford is that our intro class is our intro for everyone. That we don't have a majors entry point in a non-majors entry point, and an advanced student thing like that. It's like, Oh, there is 106A which is designed to be called the big tent. It brings in everybody. We want everyone to give a chance to it and be taught in the way we want. Like to build a foundation for all computer scientists. So, some of these are classes like physics for poets, or something like that, where it's like, Oh, you're really not going on. So, we're going to give you a different light version and we really don't want to do that. We don't want you to have to select before you've had a chance to really try it. And so, we want to give you the same grounding we give everyone. We really try hard to get people to start in the intro sequence, even if they have the background to sometimes jump ahead. We often think that we can do such a good job with setting the right foundation for you. That we want you to give it a try. That don't be in a hurry to jump ahead. Because even in the simple exercises where we can just imbue you with really good habits that we want you to carry forward. So, that's been the same. So, I mean what I want to say well, what did we change? I would say, we've changed the language. We've changed the tools. Our enrollments have gone crazy large. But, in the essence of it, I still think we're doing the same thing we've always wanted to do all along, which is to show you how empowering and awesome it is to be able to control this computer and then give you this really good grounding in the fundamental tools and technique and mindset that makes you be an excellent in there. That's so cool. Julie, what's missing from CS education at Stanford or anywhere in the world? Where are we at now? And what big milestones do you hope to for us to get to in let's say, five years? Well, I think we need to keep looking at the service part of the equation. That I think we serve our majors extraordinarily well. I think we have a great curriculum with a lot of flexibility. And in the undergraduate the master's curriculum, the PhD, all of that is really really good. I think, we need to keep working at ways to give computing power to people who aren't computer scientists. In a way that makes sense for them. And so, as I've said, we have this one sequence and it's for everyone. And that's great. And I do think up to a point, we can definitely keep everybody together. But there are places where there's jumping off points where I think, we need it to enable a lot of people who want to get data science type skills, machine learning type skills, but aren't going to make computer science their number one focus. And so, maybe they're a biologist or sociologist, writer, historian. And so, I think figuring out ways that we can be sure to coordinate and support giving those skills to people. Like the way the writing center, for example, might be like, everyone needs to learn how to write persuasively and attentively. And so, figuring out how we can be computer science support as a service learning for all people. I'd say, another big area for us is to dig more deeply into the ethical implications of the work we do. That I think, we've had a little bit of like, Hey, we're technology. We're neutral. We're just teaching you how algorithms work. And how to evaluate them for performance, or for robustness or correctness. But there's really growing awareness that there are absolutely certain opportunities for us to be reflecting on the bias in the data sets we use, and then the problems we're trying to solve, and then the implications of our work in a broader social context. Which I think, we need to figure out how to make that happen up and down across the curriculum. I think we've traditionally had idea if there's a class or two that's about ethics or social implications that I think we just need to weave that through our discipline all the way through. To be sure we're making responsible ethical choices at every step. Incredible. Julie, take me back now to NeXT, and then Apple. You're out of Stanford. You're entering this tech scene. You get to work with Steve Jobs. What is this like? [--] from the roots of it. This is incredible. Yeah. I think it's like, when I look back at it now, it seems more amazing that at the time. I didn't know any better. It was basically my first job out of school. So, I though it was completely normal. But you have a superstar. Like for the longest time, I had this dingy car. This Dodge HB 210, that was an old junker of a car. And I used to park a little bit far away from the building. Because I thought my car was ugly and rundown and I was still just paying off my student loans. And so, I parked in a way around the corner for the building, a little bit M shape. But it was interesting how there was often a black Porsche that would also be in the same spot. I picked to have for me the first one around the corner from the building. And it was a black Porsche with no license plates, which at the time, I didn't know these stories yet. About how Steve was apparently like this, couldn't be bothered to get a license plate for his car. And so, depending on who got there first. Either I would have the spot, or the black Porsche would have the spot. I didn't realize it was Steve's car, until one day, I come out, and he's parked in the next part over. And he's standing by his car talking to somebody. And I'm coming out to my car. And he scolds me for parking at his spot. And I'm terrified. I've been there, I don't know, not that long. Like a few months or so. But I'm like, I think I'm about to get fired over it. But he was kidding. He didn't care. It was just funny that everybody else, apparently will do this. Don't park in Steve's stop. But I was like, Oh, okay, whatever. I'm  just trying to hide my ugly car over here. But anyway, so then, I stopped parking in there. Unbelievable. How many people were at NeXT when you joined over there? So, we were probably close to 200 people at that point. I think we've had maybe four or 500 at our biggest when were doing both hardware and software. But, we did cut our hardware business and scale back to the softwares. So, by the time we got acquired, we're probably were back down to 200 again. So, we were pretty small that whole time, I would say. What are some of the most important lessons you learned from that time that then you took with you, as you then transitioned back to education? Yeah, I loved working at NeXT. But the strongest memory, of course, is just the people. The people who were hired there. And their passion for what we were doing was just really infectious. And maybe the biggest lesson I took away from NeXT was, I had to go back to grad school. Because I was working. So, at that point, I had an undergrad degree in math. My training in CS was pretty thin. I was learning a lot on the job. I was working at an engineering capacity, but I was definitely a junior person. And there were all these people around me who just had a wealth of knowledge and experience and practice that I was super envious of. And I can remember, people would casually talk off, toss off terms or tools or, Oh, well, when I was at Sun, we did this kind of stuff. And I just wanted, I was hungry for that same experience, that the same underpinning, of what they knew that helped them to make great decisions going forward. And so, it was great to work with them and learn from them. But I also knew I needed to go back to the source myself and strengthen up my own background. So, you realized that at the time you were working with some of the greatest pioneers of NeXT? Yeah. It seemed normal to me. But that was because, I never had a real job before. I mean, I was in high school, I worked on a player piano plays. The idea that I thought it was super normal to have this just incredibly high powered, really dedicated, really talented group of people that just solve problems and batted ideas around. I can still remember the way it felt like, since we're so small. You could make decisions about things. And it's like you keep looking for something like, do we have to get some approval? I can remember going to [--] who was the head of the workspace develop at the time. And there was this decision we needed to make about how something was going to happen. And so, I go to him, he's relatively new too. So, we have this conversation about what our options are. We bat some ideas around that. He says, "Okay, I think we should do this." And I'm like, "Well, okay." "But, this is just you and me." "We're like this two foot soldiers here." "Don't we need to go get somebody else?" You looking in for your mom. I don't know what you like. You think, we have to have some. He's like, "No. No. That's what we do." "This is what we were hired to do, is make these decisions and make this stuff happen." And you're like, "Oh, I guess we just get to do that." And that happened again and again. Just lots of cool things to do and smart people to work with. And so, from it, I said I had to go back to grad school. So, I want to be able to go deep on some of this stuff. And school's going to be a good place for me to do that. I mean, I think there are other people who learn different ways. It wasn't the only way maybe to catch up to that level of expertise. But for me, it was I had been a good student and I think the school worked for my mindset and my level of obedience maybe, or something like that. That is so cool. Julie, as I go on my journey, and a lot of my friends going on their journey into computer science with Stanford in general, what is the one piece of advice you would give a young student as we're about to go and absorb so many classes from so many incredible instructors? What are some things that I can keep in mind as I go through this journey and maintain perspective? Wow. I would say, there's so many great things about Stanford. And so many great experiences. And the one thing I would say is just be mindful of picking and choosing. Realizing that saying "yes" to something often means having to say "no" to something else and thinking about, as you look at things, there's going to be lots of things that sound really awesome and are really awesome. But if they're not right for you, they're going to eat away from getting a lot of things that really matter for you. So, it's easy to get people get, I think, a little bit sidelined. Somebody else is doing this and that sounds really cool. Or, this seems kind of interesting. Or, I want to take all these classes. I want to have a double major. I want to build stuff. And instances like, by spreading yourself too thin, you miss some of the discernment of say, what are the things I really want to be sure I get from Stanford, and I want to make sure I don't miss out on, and that really are going to fuel me for the future. And then, recognize that, as I say yes to those things, I want to say yes wholeheartedly and enthusiastically. And that's going to give me the strength to also say no to things that would otherwise cut into that. I love it. I see a lot of students who just seem like they're just really spread very very thin. And I feel like that they get very over-committed. And then they're dealing with, I think, a lot of stress and a lot of, I think, suboptimal results for that. I mean, I think, that one of the things that I came in and was completely blown away was by the number of opportunities. And, almost everywhere you turn, somebody is doing something so cool. And I'm coming in, and it's like in the playground. You just want to get all the different fruits. And then, I think that one of the hard lessons that I had to learn, as well as my friends, is understanding that, Okay, well, if we really want to enjoy this time and make it work for us, we need to also be able to devote ourselves to the projects we commit to. And it's not going to do service to anybody if we just go and do limits and do five clubs. So, I completely, I'll take this with me. You already have that advice. I just have to agree with different piece of advice next. Because that's a great thing to have already figured out. That and for many more advises along the way. But Julie, I have to know three words that you would use to describe yourself. Okay, I'm going to give you, Curious. I think that's driven a lot of what got me everywhere I wanted to be, was just wanting to know, wanting to see it through. And then, it comes with a heavy dose of Stubborn. Because, I think that stubbornness and curiosity, I think, drive all the debugging in the world. But it turns out as, I'm going to figure this out, and I'm going to know why, and I'm going to get there. And then, I think what makes me a teacher, I think, is Enthusiasm. At least I can say, I think, almost definitively why I'm a teacher is any time I learn something, the first thing I'm thinking about is who am I going to tell that to? Like I read something in a paper, or see it online, or go to a talk. And then I'm like, who else wants to hear this really cool thing that I learned? So, I think that if you see yourself as this conduit for information to come in and flow out, then teaching maybe the career you want to look at. I love it. Okay, Julie, very very much, this was inspiring. I learned so much and I can't wait to share this with the world. Thank you for taking the time to do this. Thank you, Michael. Good to see you. [--] [--] It was really inspiring. Really. Yeah. Yeah. If that's the whole topic, we could go on for a long time about it. Like how phenomenal it is to work with the people at Stanford. So, Pat Hanrahan, our co-instructor. who is Turing Award winner. I just never thought I would spend my career in the company of such luminaries nonstop. So, it has been really a great ride. It was also a very humbling experience all of a sudden to be exposed to that. Julie, thank you very very much. Have a great rest of the day. And stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you. You too. Bye bye.
