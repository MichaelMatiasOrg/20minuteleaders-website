00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,480
Adi Levanon Chazan,

2
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,280
I'm so happy we're finally doing this.

3
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,840
Thank you for the time.

4
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,960
Thank you so much.

5
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,000
I really appreciate it.

6
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,400
This is gonna be so much fun

7
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,560
and there's so much

8
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,280
that I want to talk about,

9
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,160
but first I want to start

10
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,800
with your journey

11
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,600
because just going over your background,

12
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,040
I got overwhelmed by seeing

13
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,600
the number of different places

14
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,760
that you've gone

15
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,520
through the venture capital firms,

16
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,200
to product at companies, and then

17
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,640
back to venture capital firms

18
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,440
across continents.

19
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,960
So Adi, dumb it down for me.

20
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,920
How do you get

21
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,320
to where you are now at Flint Capital

22
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,200
and helping invest in Israel,

23
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,880
but also previously in New York.

24
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,440
Talk to me about your journey.

25
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,200
Yeah, for sure.

26
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,600
So, I'm American originally.

27
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,480
I'm actually from your neck

28
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,240
of the woods right now.

29
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,280
So I grew up in Palo Alto.

30
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,080
Parents were Israeli.

31
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,200
Moved to Israel when I was 12

32
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,560
with the family,

33
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,920
and basically everything I've done

34
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,480
after the army was either in startups

35
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,560
or in venture capital in some shape or form.

36
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,680
I'm a lawyer, but I don't practice.

37
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,720
So I guess some call it a recovering lawyer.

38
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,320
And yeah, I mean, I think

39
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,720
I've been in different places

40
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,240
because I've just been fortunate

41
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,280
basically every time to get

42
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,520
more exposure, more responsibility.

43
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,560
I started off, like I said, as a lawyer,

44
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,160
at the one of Israel's

45
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,720
first billion dollar Internet companies,

46
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,440
called Conduit.

47
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,680
I start up there as legal counsel,

48
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,280
and then I moved on

49
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,640
to manage the compliance team.

50
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,060
Michael, you're on mute.

51
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,560
Thank you very much.

52
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,920
When you go to study law

53
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,000
and you go to law school,

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,760
do you go there with the perception

55
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,120
that you want to be a lawyer later on

56
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,080
at a tech company?

57
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
Or do you just say,

58
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay, I want to be a lawyer

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,600
because I'm interested in law?

60
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,680
Yeah. It's a really good question.

61
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,920
So, I can give you my perspective, right,

62
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,040
'cause it's only from my point of view.

63
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,880
But I always, I think for me,

64
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,560
the way I got to where I am now

65
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,480
is basically I always think

66
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,360
a few steps ahead.

67
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
So, I kind of knew in my mind

68
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,440
that even though I liked law

69
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,480
and enjoyed it,

70
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
the things I liked most

71
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,640
were contract law and business law.

72
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,240
So, I knew that even if I would join

73
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,320
as legal counsel, I always had the desire

74
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,760
to go to the business side at some point

75
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,160
which I think

76
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,560
is why I became legal counsel

77
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,240
as my first job as a lawyer.

78
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,720
And I basically went down that road.

79
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:49,960
Right?

80
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,600
So, from legal counsel at the company,

81
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,920
then I managed a compliance team

82
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,560
which in many ways was a combination of,

83
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,040
between law,

84
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,440
but also a lot of business

85
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,400
and also very technical.

86
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,080
I managed a team

87
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,600
of developers, and analysts,

88
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,040
and I worked with all the R&D teams.

89
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah. And at that time we had

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,680
two main clients,

91
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,760
were Google and Microsoft Bing.

92
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,400
So I kind of had to be the, in many ways,

93
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,760
the bottleneck with regards

94
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,040
to any kind of new product or any kind of

95
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,560
major partnership that we had.

96
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,760
Yeah. So, it was pretty cool in that sense.

97
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,960
So, what it sounds to me is that

98
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,680
you're taking this,

99
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,120
you're starting out as a lawyer,

100
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,600
you're joining a billion dollar company,

101
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,760
Conduit, in Israel.

102
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,440
And then you go and you work

103
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,240
with huge clients,

104
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,760
and that put you in the position

105
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,000
where you're in the intersection

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,680
between the tech and the compliance.

107
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,240
And you're getting the exposure,

108
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,200
both of the R&D,

109
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,040
but also from your background.

110
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,520
And slowly you're moving yourself

111
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,160
to the business.

112
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,520
And then how do you go to product

113
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,280
and venture capital from there?

114
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,200
So first there was,

115
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,920
I'm in venture capital,

116
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,600
so I moved on to Rhodium from there,

117
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,000
which you know also that ...

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,680
he was part of the team

119
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,900
and Daniel Recanati obviously

120
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,820
and ...

121
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,680
So I moved on to there.

122
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,520
I actually got my first leg into VC

123
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,760
as a student at IDC,

124
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,680
at IDC Herzliya,

125
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,480
actually working for what was then

126
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,560
Cardinal Ventures

127
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,160
is now Viola.

128
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,640
So I worked there actually as a student.

129
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,240
At some point, I did like almost 75%

130
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,360
of a position while I was doing

131
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,160
two degrees.

132
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,520
So that's my first picture

133
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,360
in the world of VC.

134
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,720
And then, when I heard from a friend

135
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,680
actually for a portfolio company at Rhodium,

136
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
they were looking for somebody

137
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,840
to join the team, the investment team.

138
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,600
I was like, Okay. This is where I want to go.

139
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,760
I had that just hunger

140
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,200
to enter that space.

141
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,680
I thought it was so interesting.

142
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,640
I heard about it from my parents

143
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,600
'cause they were always in tech,

144
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,320
and just I was like,

145
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,640
I need to go down that route.

146
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,280
And yeah, I was really fortunate.

147
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,920
I think that a lot of what I went through

148
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,400
in compliance managing teams,

149
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,760
like you said,

150
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,880
and working with R&D teams

151
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,800
really helped me then

152
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
when I met with founders at Rhodium.

153
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,320
So Adi, I want you to take me back

154
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,720
a little bit

155
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,920
and give me the pivotal moments

156
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,800
in your upbringing where,

157
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,160
because right now you're one of the

158
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,720
most popular investors in Israel.
- Thank you

159
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,640
And I've been recommended to talk to you

160
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,120
on this show from so many people

161
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,600
that I can't even count anymore.

162
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,720
Thank you.

163
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,560
So I'm curious. At the end, one of the things

164
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,080
I'm curious about is what helps a person

165
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
get to where they are today?

166
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,520
Is it just their passion?

167
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,760
Is it opportunities

168
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,560
that they were seizing?

169
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,640
Is it motivation?

170
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,200
So, what were some of the pivotal moments

171
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,160
that you really became passionate

172
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,400
and you knew, I want to devote myself

173
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,440
to the work that I'm doing?

174
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,800
I think it's a really good question.

175
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,000
I mean, it's a lot of the things

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,640
you said, right?

177
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,880
So first, people who know me

178
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,360
know I'm a very passionate person.

179
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,400
I get very very excited about things

180
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,600
that I believe in, sometimes too much.

181
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,240
But I'm very very excited about things

182
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,080
I'm passionate about.

183
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,000
And I think that passion

184
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,960
is something that is contagious.

185
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,440
So I think that helps

186
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,120
when you meet people,

187
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,280
they see that you want something

188
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,920
and you're interested,

189
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,640
I think that's helped.

190
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,760
But in many ways,

191
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,960
to get to where you want to go,

192
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,160
I mean, I say this a lot,

193
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,360
I think you really need to be open

194
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,160
to meeting people,

195
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,480
be open to hearing other people's stories,

196
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,280
and learn from their stories

197
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,720
what works for you and what doesn't.

198
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,000
Like I've always done my homework before

199
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,840
every step I took, whether it was

200
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,600
I moved to New York, I had nothing, right?

201
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,520
Like, I had nothing.

202
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,320
I had family and everything,

203
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,840
but in New York,

204
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,280
I didn't come with a partner.

205
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,760
I had maybe knew three people.

206
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,480
I didn't have an apartment.

207
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,840
I didn't have a job.

208
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,160
But I came very structured.

209
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,360
And I think everything I've done

210
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,560
was always very structured.

211
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,400
Like I said, I always thought

212
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,200
a few steps ahead.

213
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,440
So like where do I want to go,

214
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,640
and how do I get there.

215
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,000
And I think having a structure,

216
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,840
and passion, and talking to people,

217
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,760
and not being, having that grit, like not being shy.

218
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,800
I was almost saying ashamed.

219
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,840
But it's not about being ashamed,

220
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,640
it's not being shy to reach out to people.

221
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,240
I've reached out to partners,

222
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,800
really large VC funds in New York

223
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,520
before I moved and said,

224
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,120
"I'm moving. This is my background.

225
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,640
I'd love to have coffee."

226
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,960
And in many cases, it worked.

227
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,320
And I really believe that, I mean

228
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,000
it worked for me then,

229
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,160
and I really believe that also today.

230
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,680
So, I hope that answers your question.

231
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,920
It definitely does.

232
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,120
And my follow up question

233
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,160
is why venture capital?

234
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,800
It sounds like

235
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,960
with your passion and consistency,

236
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,920
you can choose any job

237
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,600
you want in the world,

238
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,560
yet you choose to focus

239
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,880
on venture capital. Why do that

240
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,160
instead of continuing to another company

241
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,560
or creating your own company?

242
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,120
It's a good question.

243
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,920
I love venture. I love this job.

244
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,360
I love the ability to,

245
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,720
I'm a very curious person,

246
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,640
so I love the fact that I get to meet

247
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,040
so many different people

248
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,200
with so many different ideas

249
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
and learn from them.

250
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,160
My curiosity is constantly fed

251
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,080
on a daily basis,

252
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,280
which really intrigues me.

253
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,160
And I really love

254
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,440
being able to be helpful and be impactful,

255
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:11,960
and I think that

256
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
that's a lot of what we do.

257
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,200
I mean not every fund does that,

258
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,360
not every investor does that.

259
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,760
But people that know me,

260
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,480
I think founders that know me,

261
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,000
like I try hard to work, I work for them.

262
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,840
And I think that,

263
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,160
at least I see it that way,

264
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,440
hopefully that they will agree.

265
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
But that's how I kind of view it.

266
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,760
So, trying to be helpful.

267
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,920
And I think that, in the end of the day,

268
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,500
the combination of a financial business

269
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,080
In the end of the day,

270
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,200
we are an asset class

271
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,400
like any other in many ways.

272
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,240
But being able to bring something

273
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,920
that's beneficial and brings money,

274
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,240
but also impacts the world

275
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,160
hopefully in a positive way

276
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,440
makes me feel really good,

277
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,320
and that gets me up in the morning.

278
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,400
And of course, I think

279
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,920
that working for a startup is fantastic.

280
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,520
And who knows

281
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,400
what will happen in the future,

282
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,920
but in general, I love this job.

283
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,400
I think for me also, I love the fact

284
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,720
that I see different things.

285
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,120
I've had opportunities in the past

286
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,640
to join, even I was in New York,

287
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,720
to join portfolio companies as a COO

288
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,560
and things like that.

289
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,160
And I just thought, "I'll come in

290
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,200
and I'll do this and it'll be great"

291
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,080
But after six months,

292
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,720
I think I'll be like,

293
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,120
"Okay, what's next?"

294
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,680
Not because it's not interesting,

295
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,600
but I do like touching different things

296
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,280
at once. That's just me personally.

297
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,320
That's so so cool. Okay.

298
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,360
So now, talking about journeys

299
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,960
and I'd love to talk

300
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,720
about one of the things

301
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,880
that you're really passionate about:

302
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,200
diversity in tech.

303
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,800
And I think, on one hand,

304
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,400
it's a subject that is being spoken about

305
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,480
more and more in our domain.

306
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,080
On the other hand,

307
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,680
it's definitely not spoken about enough.

308
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,920
And not enough has been done

309
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,840
to bring that, to level the playing field.

310
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,080
And as a mother,

311
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,560
and as an ambitious career woman,

312
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,240
I'd love to hear your take on

313
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,120
where are we at today,

314
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,080
and what do you think needs to happen

315
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,720
in order to level the playing field

316
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,400
much more than what is being done today?

317
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,280
So fantastic question.

318
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,960
So, I think there is a shift,

319
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,880
but it's a little bit

320
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,320
I mean it's slow, right?

321
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,320
I mean, my point of view has been

322
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,840
for a while is that, if we don't

323
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,480
I mean, there's some people

324
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,440
that focus on the top down approach,

325
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,920
okay, which is we need to start

326
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,600
from schools.

327
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,760
We need to start educating.

328
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,760
We need to start, even in the form

329
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,920
of removing biases.

330
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,760
There's this known,

331
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,520
I forget what type of bias it's called,

332
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,840
I think it's the acceptance bias

333
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,920
if I'm not mistaken, I don't remember.

334
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,800
But, you're not gonna think

335
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,880
about a doctor versus being a female

336
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,320
unless you see many female doctors.

337
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,520
Right?

338
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,160
There's something about

339
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,720
having that vision in front of you

340
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,760
that helps children

341
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,480
at the end of the day,

342
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,280
think that they can be

343
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,760
the next founder, the next CEO,

344
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,440
the next astronaut etc. etc.

345
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,640
So, some people focus on that

346
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,000
and I think

347
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,640
that's really really important.

348
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,480
I really believe that in our world

349
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,920
it needs to come top down,

350
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,240
and I'm not the only one that thinks this,

351
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,680
but I've wrote a few post about it.

352
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,280
And I think that, the problem is is that

353
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,280
we don't have enough people at the top

354
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,640
that trickle down and say,

355
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,600
Okay. Either I'm a CEO of a Fortune 500,

356
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,240
or I'm a wealthy individual,

357
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,600
or whatever it may be,

358
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,640
I have the opportunity

359
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,560
to be impactful and be helpful.

360
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,960
But do I actually do anything

361
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,680
to bring more women in to sit next to me?

362
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
And that just, it's not enough.

363
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,600
And I think it's shifting.

364
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,240
But from my mind, it's like I,

365
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,280
just as an example.

366
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,600
I started, it's not even

367
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,720
a very very organized process,

368
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,020
but I started something within,

369
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,560
there's some female investors in Israel,

370
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,360
a few funds.

371
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,020
They started this VC group of women in VC.

372
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,960
And there were like 40 something of us.

373
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
And I said, you know there's so many pitch events

374
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,560
all the time.

375
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,120
Yeah, it's a lot.

376
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,200
I think they're more than 40 now.

377
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,240
I think there's near 50

378
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,400
which is fantastic.

379
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,360
So that, in it of itself,

380
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,040
shows that there is a shift.

381
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,120
But hold on. That I think is great.

382
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,680
And because I noticed that we have such

383
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,160
amazing power in this platform,

384
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,160
let's go and just do pitch events,

385
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,800
or office hours some places call it,

386
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,680
for female founders.

387
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,320
And we've been doing it

388
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,240
for a few months now

389
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,600
and it's been fantastic.

390
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,840
But the reason why I'm so excited about it

391
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,600
is a few things.

392
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,480
I think that it's really important

393
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,800
that more female VCs make decisions,

394
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,840
because if we're not making the decisions

395
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,440
and we're not part

396
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,400
of the investment committee,

397
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:58,920
and we're not part

398
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,280
of the actual decisions and check writing,

399
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,480
we're not gonna get to that place

400
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,600
of being a partner, and then

401
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,960
maybe later in the day

402
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,200
becoming an LP ourselves

403
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,320
or angel investor, etc.

404
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,240
So, that's in one hand from the VC side.

405
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,440
And then obviously, helping the founders,

406
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,520
female founders who statistically

407
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,600
we know they have a harder time

408
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,440
raising money, have a better opportunity

409
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,800
from women that they usually don't meet

410
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,920
at the table.

411
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,400
So, both sides of that,

412
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,320
I think is really crucial,

413
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,920
but it really needs to come from the top.

414
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,640
We need more LPs that are women.

415
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,200
We need more CEOs to be women.

416
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,280
We just need more people

417
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,080
that have capital and access

418
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,760
and the ability to make decisions

419
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,000
to start making it for women.

420
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,880
And not just women, by the way.

421
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,240
Any diversity.

422
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,120
Whether it's in Israel,

423
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,240
I would say Arabs and Ethiopians

424
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,480
and whatever it may be.

425
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,560
People with disabilities,

426
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,280
it doesn't matter.

427
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,080
100%. 100%.

428
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,720
One of the things

429
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,680
that I've been contemplating,

430
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,040
here in California, being in the midst

431
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,760
of the Black Lives Matter movement.

432
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,840
One of the things that dawned on me,

433
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,640
and the movement is talking all about,

434
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,360
not the fact that the black lives matter,

435
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,080
everybody knows that,

436
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,800
but it's more specific than that.

437
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,600
It's saying that people

438
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,400
that are not minority,

439
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,840
that have what they call white privilege,

440
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,800
we have an innate responsibility

441
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,840
not only to not be racist,

442
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,960
but to actually take action against it.

443
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,200
Right?

444
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,760
So, being a bystander

445
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,600
is a part of the problem.

446
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,080
And I think that

447
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,440
what you're saying here top down,

448
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,000
and being, as a decision maker,

449
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,760
not saying that you promote diversity,

450
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,360
but actually taking action

451
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,680
and speaking out about that.

452
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,720
So, I think that's something

453
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,480
that's definitely true.

454
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,200
But Adi, I also want to talk about

455
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,840
a little bit about investing.

456
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,480
So coming in, I'm having

457
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,720
the time of my life with Oded Hermoni

458
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,880
at J-Ventures.

459
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,800
And as I'm understanding the world

460
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,480
a little bit better,

461
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,640
one thing that is very evident is that

462
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,840
different places around the world

463
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,280
invest in different ways.

464
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,000
And as I get to speak to leaders

465
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,320
from different areas in the world,

466
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,840
I get to hear

467
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,560
about the different mindsets.

468
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,600
You have the unique privilege of seeing

469
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,280
both the New York side and Tel Aviv side.

470
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,360
And I'd love to hear a little bit

471
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,680
about your investment thesis

472
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,600
and how do you approach opportunities,

473
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,040
and what are some of the key questions

474
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,680
that you're thinking about?

475
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,480
So just to take a little bit of a step back.

476
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,960
So, in general, Flint capital

477
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,640
is a global fund.

478
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,880
So we invest out of Israel,

479
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,360
but we also invest in the US and Europe.

480
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,080
And before that,

481
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,280
I worked for two funds in New York

482
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,000
that one, both of them, I mean one of them

483
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,520
was actually kind of global, FinTech Collective

484
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,920
has a global point of view and a

485
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,080
global thesis on investing

486
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,880
in FinTech companies.

487
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,080
And then Symmetrical Ventures

488
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,480
we invested just in companies in the US.

489
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,240
So, I've had the opportunity to invest

490
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,520
in startups that are located

491
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,000
in New York, Atlanta, LA,

492
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,680
Silicon Valley, but also here in Tel Aviv.

493
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,080
So that's just in general.

494
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,880
So, I think I've been fortunate

495
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
to really have a perspective

496
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,400
on different ecosystems,

497
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,880
which I think is really important.

498
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,760
Right.

499
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,760
What I'll say is this.

500
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,320
I think that, and this is not just a plug,

501
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,000
I think this is something

502
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,840
that's really important about investing

503
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,680
is the fact that

504
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,000
we are, as Flint Capital,

505
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,480
we have an opportunity to be here.

506
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:49,600
Right

507
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
I'm the only person here in Israel

508
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,840
in the investment team.

509
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,320
But we have a partner in Boston,

510
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,640
I think that you know ...

511
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,280
So he comes out here often,

512
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,760
or before covid he came here often.

513
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,280
But the ability to be East Coast

514
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,960
and West Coast,

515
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,720
to be in different ecosystems

516
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,000
and have information

517
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,360
from different ecosystems,

518
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,840
and being able to see what's happening,

519
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,560
get information,

520
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,400
understand the different VCs,

521
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,800
understand the different leaders,

522
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,920
is really really important.

523
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,480
And I think that that's one thing.

524
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,800
I would say that investing here

525
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,320
is very different than in the States

526
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,520
in a few ways. I mean I think it's just

527
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,960
what funds look for, right?

528
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,920
There is, I'll give you an example,

529
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,440
and this is gonna be very. I mean,

530
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,200
and this might not sound weird to you

531
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,160
because you said people out of 8200

532
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,520
and the like, so I think that

533
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,320
in Israel there is a lot of that,

534
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,840
which is also not good

535
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,240
when we think about diversity, right?

536
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,160
Diversity is not just about

537
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,760
male or female.

538
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,680
It's just about being different in general.

539
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,800
So I think that in Israel, there's a lot

540
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,000
of this copy-paste sometimes,

541
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,240
where you can find

542
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,040
very talented individuals

543
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,240
that came out of prime minister's office

544
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,560
or 8200 or any one of the other,

545
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,680
9900, any one of these fantastic units,

546
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,080
and then they have not much experience,

547
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,160
very tech based, but they're like,

548
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,920
this is what I'm doing.

549
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,000
I can't tell you what I'm doing,

550
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,200
but I'm raising money.

551
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,320
And then the expectation

552
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,760
is for me to be like, I'm in.

553
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,920
And by the way, many funds will be.

554
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
Now, I understand

555
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,840
because when you're very smart technically

556
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,440
and you have so much experience

557
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,320
and you can get very far. You can.

558
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,840
But I don't think that in the States

559
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,360
you will see so much of that in general.

560
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,760
Somebody coming out of MIT

561
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,960
or Carnegie Mellon or the like,

562
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,080
and being like, now we're gonna throw

563
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,560
five million dollars because,

564
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,040
or I don't know,

565
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,320
even if you came out of some elite unit

566
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,160
in the US Army,

567
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,600
I don't think that it would be the same.

568
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,200
Because essentially, as you know

569
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,560
and I know, I think in the States

570
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,400
and I think also funds here know that too,

571
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,640
that it's really really important

572
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,000
to have the business acumen.

573
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,120
To understand positioning.

574
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,680
To understand

575
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,480
how you're going to sell your company.

576
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,200
And I think that

577
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,040
that is a bit of a difference.

578
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,240
But, from the other hand,

579
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,560
the reason why that works in Israel

580
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,200
is because it's a small ecosystem.

581
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,120
And we know each other.

582
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,320
And it's easy to get that,

583
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,480
to get the viewpoint on people,

584
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,000
understand that

585
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,120
they have the capabilities.

586
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,320
And then, I think that what's good now

587
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,760
is that, good or bad we can discuss.

588
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Some people see it differently.

589
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,080
A lot of funds, they have now

590
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,760
this network that they provide

591
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,760
to the founders.

592
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,520
Right.

593
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,400
And to help them get

594
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,280
to where they get to go,

595
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,640
anywhere they need to go.

596
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,520
It's different.

597
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,680
It's just very very different.

598
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,480
But I think that there is

599
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,680
more camaraderie.

600
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,320
I mean, in New York,

601
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,560
I was super impressed.

602
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,320
Like I think I loved it

603
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,720
that we were sharing between each other.

604
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:21,960
VCs, super ...

605
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,800
I don't know if it's like that

606
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,280
in the Valley. In New York.
- I didn't expect that.

607
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,680
I don't know, the people that I met

608
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,920
and the funds that I met, investors,

609
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,920
we would share information.

610
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,000
If I saw something interesting,

611
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,880
what do you think about this,

612
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,560
what are your thoughts,

613
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,200
what are you looking at.

614
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,560
It was a lot of sharing

615
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,320
for the sake of working together

616
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,160
and getting feedback,

617
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,440
especially in the FinTech funds at least.

618
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,120
I don't know, but not just, not just.

619
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,360
And I think here, that's happening too,

620
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,680
but it depends, again, which sectors.

621
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,000
Some of them are more like,

622
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,040
let's keep it in stealth mode

623
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,840
and not really share.

624
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,680
So, I think those are the differences.

625
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,000
And I think it's really important

626
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,320
for founders when they think about,

627
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
always think up, like I said before,

628
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,480
thinking few steps ahead.

629
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,800
So when you get your seed investor,

630
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,840
I would always think about,

631
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,880
or even your pre-seed,

632
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,760
but think about who you want to be

633
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,800
around the table for your A

634
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,320
and how to get there.

635
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,560
And I think that's really important.

636
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,720
I think that one of the things

637
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,200
that you mentioned so resonated with me,

638
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,760
because I spent four and a half years

639
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,480
in one of those units in the IDF.

640
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,040
And then I came here to Stanford

641
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,280
to continue my studies

642
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,000
and continue enriching my own knowledge

643
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,760
both in engineering, but also in business

644
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,840
and scaling products

645
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,200
and obviously with J-Ventures.

646
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,520
And one of the key distinctions,

647
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,640
like you mentioned, is I'm seeing

648
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,040
in the IDF, we're sitting down,

649
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,000
we're doing computer science.

650
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,880
Really really great advanced technology

651
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,880
for many years.

652
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,800
And then a lot of my friends go out

653
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,040
and they build startups.

654
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,960
Here, all of a sudden at Stanford,

655
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,840
the first class we have

656
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,600
is introduction to deep learning.

657
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,400
The second class

658
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,680
is how to scale your product.

659
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,120
It's constantly intertwined.

660
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
What often we find, though, is that,

661
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,080
and I've talked to quite

662
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,400
a few professors here and they mentioned

663
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,120
that oftentimes a Technion graduate,

664
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,600
or a graduate of the unit, has more skills

665
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,520
than a Stanford or MIT graduate

666
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,720
which is interesting.

667
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,680
But obviously leads to,

668
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,560
No. No. Of course.

669
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,360
I mean, that's why it does work.

670
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,800
I think that what we get in the army

671
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,840
is you can't get that

672
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,040
in many other places for sure.

673
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,400
But it's, I think you'll agree with me,

674
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,600
it's not the same as

675
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
exactly as working in a company

676
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,560
and growing within and doing an internship

677
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
at somewhere in the States.

678
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,040
I think the best thing

679
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,880
to be able to do, this

680
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,840
is some crazy idea

681
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,160
I had once, is that if we could get

682
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,480
Israelis the opportunity,

683
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,760
Israelis out of the army,

684
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,600
the opportunity to work for two years,

685
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,240
at a ray of fortune 100 companies

686
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,800
as a tech job for two years,

687
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,840
learn what it's like to be

688
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,000
in these companies and they can decide

689
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,320
if they want to stay or they want to go

690
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,040
and build their own thing.

691
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,760
But get that network,

692
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,880
get that knowledge, and get the expertise

693
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,880
of what it's like to work

694
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
in corporate America

695
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,240
because that'll be so beneficial

696
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,720
for their next cyber company

697
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,280
or whatever company they'll do.

698
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,320
That sounds amazing.

699
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,000
Adi, I can't believe

700
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,960
we're almost at 20 minutes.

701
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,760
And I have to spend the last few minutes

702
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,560
understanding you a little bit better.

703
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,880
And I'd love to ask simply

704
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,040
a difficult question.

705
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,840
What are you passionate about?

706
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,520
Why do you wake up every morning

707
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,440
and look at deals

708
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,200
and do the work that you do?

709
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
What are you really passionate about

710
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,720
right now?

711
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,800
So, I mean, there is the

712
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,120
what we do in the fund, right?

713
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,320
I mean, we invest and we look at companies

714
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,000
that are data driven.

715
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,160
Any company that has some form

716
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,800
of cognitive technology.

717
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,440
I'm gonna drop the buzzwords,

718
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,840
but there is a meaning behind it.

719
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,880
So, we do like companies

720
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,300
that are AI-based, NLP,

721
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:20,840
whatever it will be

722
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,040
in the world of cognitive tech.

723
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,240
But why is that interesting?

724
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,040
We really believe, and I myself as well,

725
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,600
the ability to use technology,

726
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,680
as you know very well,

727
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,240
to make our lives better.

728
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,320
To make our lives easier.

729
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,400
To make certain processes

730
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,600
that we didn't think about exist.

731
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,520
Or to take processes that didn't work

732
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,440
and just make them work better and well,

733
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,720
and obviously have a business around it.

734
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,080
I personally, obviously I'm excited

735
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,200
about those businesses

736
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,360
that also have some benefit

737
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,720
to humanity as well.

738
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,040
And it doesn't need to be impact.

739
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,280
Right?

740
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,400
Like if you're a company that obviously,

741
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,680
you're helping me with continue to work

742
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,800
out of the office in a very easy, secure way,

743
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,680
okay, that also does good for me.
- Of course.

744
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
But I think that being able to
But like, for example,

745
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,960
what I liked about FinTech,

746
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,760
specifically, is that, and I still do,

747
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,160
is that there really is a way to invest

748
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,200
in a company that is financially focused,

749
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,320
that wants to work within

750
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,800
the world of finance,

751
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,280
but you're helping the underbanked

752
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,440
the unbanked, emerging markets.

753
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,680
You're doing things that you didn't think

754
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,920
you were necessarily doing

755
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,440
and you're making an impact

756
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,720
even if you ... think you actually were.

757
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,960
So, to me, that's always

758
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,480
very very interesting and important.

759
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,720
And I think that,

760
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,560
and what gets me up in the morning,

761
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,000
like I said, is just being able

762
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,400
to be a part of that.

763
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,200
To be able to meet these individuals.

764
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,960
There's that moment

765
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,200
when you meet that entrepreneur,

766
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,080
whether female or male,

767
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,600
and you're like, "Holy wow.

768
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,960
This is just the right team.

769
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,400
I have to invest in this"

770
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,480
I mean there's a company right now

771
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,080
that I'm looking at

772
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,160
that I hope we close the deal.

773
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,600
I can't give

774
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,640
too much information obviously,

775
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,680
but they're focusing

776
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,360
on such a big, important market

777
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,040
that touches each and every one of us

778
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,120
and the technology's super strong.

779
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,320
But I mean, when I will share it with you

780
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,920
hopefully, and we do hopefully invest,

781
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,280
you're gonna hear about it and be like,

782
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,240
Wow. Like this is so, it seems so simple,

783
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,680
but it's so important.

784
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,880
And it's so different.

785
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,800
And when you meet something like that,

786
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,240
where it's a big, big market

787
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,560
and really, really pain.

788
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,120
And it's not just a pain to a few people,

789
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,040
it's a pain to all of us

790
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,720
like in our hearts.

791
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,560
I think that it's like

792
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,600
you just want to invest.

793
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,080
You want to be a part of that journey

794
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,800
and be helpful.

795
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,600
And yeah, what gets me up

796
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,480
also in the morning, is my baby.

797
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,360
I love that.

798
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,880
I love both answers.

799
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,360
And those deals are rare, right?

800
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,840
I mean, it's not every day
- So rare.

801
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,960
that you meet a team like this.

802
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,880
And I'm good friends here

803
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,880
with Dror Berman

804
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,160
from Innovation Endeavors,

805
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,360
and every time I go to their offices

806
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,040
and I look at their board of investments

807
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,600
and I asked Dror, like,

808
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,520
"What are you excited about?"

809
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,800
And he shares with me a new deal,

810
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,080
and then to the outsider,

811
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,000
it seems that yeah,

812
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,040
there is all these amazing amazing deals

813
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,760
that come all the time,

814
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,400
but it's not true

815
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,640
and I'm seeing it at J-Ventures.

816
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,320
It's hard to find those deals.

817
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,080
They're very rare.

818
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,200
They're very competitive.

819
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,400
But at the end, being a partner

820
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,240
on a company that makes a good impact

821
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,200
on the world, on a product that scales

822
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,640
and touches people's lives,

823
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,440
that's what I'm on my journey hopefully

824
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,480
to do one day.

825
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,800
You're doing it.

826
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,040
Hippo was a great example.

827
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,600
I mean, Hippo is, yes, it's insurance,

828
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,400
but you're helping people

829
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,880
have a better security in their lives.

830
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,760
And Assaf Wand is just the best ever.

831
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,680
That's a company I wanted to invest in.

832
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,840
Sitting here, one of the things

833
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
that I love about covid,

834
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,400
and I hope he watches this

835
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,920
because he's helping sponsor this show,

836
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,520
is that I get to sit next to him

837
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,280
in an empty office of 200 people,

838
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,120
and I just get to watch him work.

839
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,960
And while I'm coding away the product,
- Bulldozer

840
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,800
I'm just listening in.

841
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,240
By the way, he's one of the people

842
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,080
I met him when he was raising,

843
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,680
I think, his seed in New York.

844
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,640
He came to FinTech Collective,

845
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,600
and I told him this: everything he said

846
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,720
he would do, he's basically done.

847
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,220
So, hats down to him.
- Unbelievable

848
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,440
Adi, three words that you would use

849
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,200
to describe yourself

850
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,280
because you already have a meeting

851
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,320
with your female VC colleague.

852
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,440
Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

853
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,040
Three words to describe myself.

854
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,800
Passionate.

855
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,320
Yes

856
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,640
Loyal.

857
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,920
Okay.

858
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:08,160
Energetic, I guess.

859
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,480
I love it. I love it.

860
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,840
Passionate, loyal and energetic.

861
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,800
Adi, toda raba.

862
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,680
Thank you very very much.

863
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,400
Toda to you. Thank you so much.

864
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
You're doing such a great job.

865
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,520
And I'm looking forward

866
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,720
to maintaining this relationship

867
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,280
and continuing to learn over the years.

868
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
Thank you.

869
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,000
Thank you.

870
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,040
Bye bye.

871
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,480
Bye.
