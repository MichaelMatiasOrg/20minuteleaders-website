1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,239
I'm very much focused

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,839
on getting things done.

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,919
I think that I took

4
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,759
every opportunity

5
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,480
to execute on something

6
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,025
as if it was the biggest thing

7
00:00:09,026 --> 00:00:10,000
for the company.

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,185
Keren Fanan,

9
00:00:42,385 --> 00:00:43,269
thank you for joining me

10
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,079
on 20 Minute Leaders.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,520
How are you?

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,479
I'm great, thank you.

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,719
How are you?

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,279
Fantastic.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:48,919
Are you calling

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,279
from Israel right now?

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,039
Yes.

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,879
Yes, I'm in Israel today.

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,599
Wonderful.

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,279
I'm in Israel as well.

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,639
And it's great

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,399
to have you on this show

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,199
because I am very excited

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,239
to talk to you about

25
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,319
your position at Gett.

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,239
And not just your position

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,679
as Chief Commercial Officer at Gett,

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,320
one of the Israel's

29
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,279
proudest companies.

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,879
A unicorn within Israel that probably

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,159
every Israeli uses

32
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,159
to travel a daily basis,

33
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,839
at least on a weekly basis.

34
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,039
But I believe that it's branched

35
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,359
to be much greater than just

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,599
Israel at this point.

37
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,079
You'll tell us more about that.

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,319
But really, your journey within Gett,

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,399
and your journey as an entrepreneur,

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,639
as you mentioned previously,

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,679
I think will be fascinating.

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,839
But we have to start all the way

43
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,240
from the beginning from Cotopaxi.

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,399
What prompted you

45
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,600
to climb the largest volcano?

46
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,279
So, yeah.

47
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,999
That's a good question.

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,200
I mean, I was always a big fan of

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,480
doing of extreme, right?

50
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,000
So, bungee jumping

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,760
and jumping from a plane.

52
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,800
And I you know,

53
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,080
when I traveled in Israel,

54
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:57,279
it's quite common that

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,520
when you finish the army,

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,840
you usually go and travel

57
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,560
for a few good months.

58
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,960
So, I did my trip

59
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,800
at South America

60
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,040
and when I got to Ecuador,

61
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,720
I was told that there is

62
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:13,519
the highest active volcano

63
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,479
that if you want,

64
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,799
you can climb.

65
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,239
And it's as simple as that.

66
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,399
You don't need to prepare.

67
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,519
You don't need to do anything.

68
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,319
You just need to register.

69
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,759
Obviously, it was extremely difficult.

70
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,879
It's like 19,000 feet, right?

71
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,319
Like more than 5,000 meters tall.

72
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,359
Right. Yeah.

73
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,119
Like you don't climb everything

74
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,239
you can do part of the road by a car.

75
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,240
And then in order to climb to the cliff,

76
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,520
you have to wake up

77
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:46,719
at something like 12AM

78
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,079
because it's freezing there.

79
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,359
So you really need

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,199
to kind of wake up

81
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,639
when it's nighttime

82
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,279
and then you have special equipment

83
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,599
and you start to climb.

84
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,999
And by the sunrise you get to the top,

85
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,199
you get to see the sunrise,

86
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,839
and then you have

87
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,239
to go all the way down.

88
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,140
So, it was really kind of

89
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,599
once in a lifetime experience.

90
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,639
I'm sure. I'm sure.

91
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,279
And I have to say that

92
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,919
I can relate pretty close

93
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,439
to what you're saying.

94
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,519
I didn't climb Cotopaxi.

95
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,119
I climbed Kilimanjaro about

96
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,340
a year and a half ago with my family.

97
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,359
And we have to wake up at midnight

98
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,650
and climb during the night

99
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:23,359
so that we have better footing

100
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,759
on the frozen hills.

101
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,759
And it's probably one of

102
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,759
the most difficult things

103
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,239
I've ever done.

104
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,879
But that reward of getting up there,

105
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,559
we actually miss

106
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,319
the sunrise by a few minutes.

107
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,560
So, we have to do it again.

108
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,560
Sounds like it.

109
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,520
It's remarkable.

110
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:40,679
Keren, what is the responsibility

111
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,359
of a chief commercial officer

112
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,760
at a company like Gett?

113
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,040
So, obviously, like commercial

114
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,599
or revenue responsibility,

115
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,320
maybe a little bit different

116
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,200
between companies.

117
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,840
So, at Gett,

118
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,399
the responsibility includes

119
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,159
to drive the revenue

120
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,559
from our core business units.

121
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,439
One of our main business units

122
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,519
at Gett is the B2B activity,

123
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,199
which we have recently developed into

124
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,319
a more of a global SaaS product.

125
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,439
So, as chief commercial,

126
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,959
I'm actually managing all of

127
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,319
the sales organization as well as

128
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,119
the account management,

129
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,320
but also the marketing activity.

130
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,039
And I'm also, you know,

131
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,999
overlooking the acquisition

132
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,879
and retention in our consumer business.

133
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,759
So, basically everything

134
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,119
that generates revenue

135
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,119
to the company sits within

136
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,759
the commercial unit.

137
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,967
It's a little bit important

138
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:37,039
from what I'm gathering.

139
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,079
Yeah. A little bit.

140
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,759
Money is important.

141
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,319
In most cases.

142
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,719
But Keren, most of us know Gett

143
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,079
as a B2C product.

144
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,999
I'm ordering it through in my app,

145
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,519
and I go down there.

146
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,399
What is a B2B initiative

147
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,239
of a ridesharing company like Gett?

148
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,399
Yeah.

149
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,759
That's a great question, because Gett

150
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
is indeed known

151
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,680
for being a consumer company because

152
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,680
that's how it was kind of born.

153
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,640
But not many people know that right after

154
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,440
the launch of the consumer service,

155
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,560
Gett also launched a B2B service

156
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,880
for corporations and basically developed

157
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,799
a technology that helps companies

158
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,280
to manage their taxi rides

159
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,880
for their employees.

160
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,640
So, for example,

161
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,440
if you work for a company

162
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,120
that, you know,

163
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,520
and you need to travel quite a lot

164
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,080
for work purposes.

165
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,880
So, if in the past you had

166
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:32,679
to go take a taxi, keep the receipt

167
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,920
and then reimburse it,

168
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,440
then and expense it,

169
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,560
then today by using the Gett platform,

170
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,440
you don't really need

171
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,160
to do it because everything is managed

172
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,640
by the Gett system

173
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,520
and all you have to do

174
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:45,239
is just to kind of switch

175
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,440
to the business profile,

176
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,440
book a taxi, and that's it.

177
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,320
It's as simple as that.

178
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:54,839
And what we've lately also been doing

179
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,319
is to take the same platform globally

180
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,319
by integrating into

181
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,720
the local providers.

182
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,040
So, we started by announcing

183
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,120
a partnership with Lyft

184
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,360
in the US because Gett

185
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,840
do not operate in the US,

186
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,000
but also with Ola in London

187
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,280
and Carey International,

188
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,200
which is a large chauffeur service

189
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,280
and so on and so forth.

190
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
We keep on integrating

191
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,640
into many, many providers.

192
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,720
So, slowly we are kind

193
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,040
of creating a global ecosystem of all

194
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,279
of the existing providers,

195
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,279
the consumer providers

196
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,599
that we all know,

197
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,919
and we make it more accessible

198
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,840
for business purposes.

199
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:30,239
It sounds complicated,

200
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,920
exciting and pretty innovative to

201
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:34,079
for a company that where there was

202
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,479
a consumer centric up until now.

203
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,839
But you're adapting

204
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,279
to the emerging needs, obviously,

205
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,399
of all of these different corporations.

206
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,679
But Keren, you have an even more unique

207
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,359
to what you're doing

208
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,079
is the journey of how you got there.

209
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,959
So, starting at entry level.

210
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,479
So before that,

211
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,439
you spent few years at AT&T.

212
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,268
Technical Project Manager now

213
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:55,099
and then moved into

214
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,159
R&D Product Management.

215
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,359
How does that work

216
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,119
entering a company like Gett

217
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,199
as an entry level and making your way

218
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,199
to C-level with internally?

219
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,120
Tell me a little bit about

220
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,280
the process and the challenges

221
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,800
that go with that.

222
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,879
I'd love to.

223
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,839
So first of all,

224
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,599
I think I would divide it

225
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,439
to two kind of major transitions. Right?

226
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,279
The first one was the fact

227
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,720
that I moved from R&D

228
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,880
and tech organizations into operations.

229
00:07:23,881 --> 00:07:25,319
Because when I joined Gett,

230
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,640
I joined as

231
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,360
a marketing operations manager,

232
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,440
which pretty much means

233
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,720
that you need to execute all of

234
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,720
the global marketing projects.

235
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,680
Before that, my experience

236
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:40,279
was solely based on R&D and technology

237
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,000
and releasing new versions

238
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,760
to become live

239
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,440
and deploy new versions.

240
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:49,599
So, that change was quite massive because

241
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,319
it's completely different language,

242
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,880
different phase,

243
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,280
and that was great.

244
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:56,359
I think Gett has given me

245
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,680
the opportunity to move

246
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,600
from tech to operations

247
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,320
without any experience in marketing.

248
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:04,119
Because they believe, in general,

249
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,199
it's a company that believes

250
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,479
that if you have the skill set

251
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,840
and the motivation,

252
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:10,159
you do not necessarily need to have

253
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,279
the super specific relevant experience,

254
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,719
which I really believe in that.

255
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,519
Because I think that

256
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,479
when people brings

257
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,720
their different experiences

258
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,800
from different roles

259
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,840
and different departments,

260
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:22,039
they actually create something

261
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,999
very much unique

262
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,839
and diverse rather than just kind

263
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,680
of doing the same over and over again.

264
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,440
So, I joined Gett

265
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,920
as marketing operations manager,

266
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,360
which is, as mentioned,

267
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,760
an entry level position.

268
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:41,159
And since then

269
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,599
I started off like crazy journey

270
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,839
or rollercoaster,

271
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,519
if you want to call it.

272
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,279
I think that there were several things

273
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,119
that helped me in that journey.

274
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,759
First of all, I'm very much focused

275
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,359
on getting things done.

276
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,319
I think that I took every opportunity

277
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,960
to execute on something,

278
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,801
as if it was the biggest thing

279
00:09:00,802 --> 00:09:01,799
for the company.

280
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,679
Looking back,

281
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,919
I know that many of the things

282
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,399
that I've done at the beginning

283
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,319
were not that important.

284
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,959
But if we were talking

285
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,279
five and a half years ago,

286
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,639
you would hear me talking about it

287
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,159
as if that is going to change

288
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,639
the face of the company.

289
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,400
I love it. I love that.

290
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,519
And I think that it's

291
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,279
a part of the thing,

292
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,194
because when you

293
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:23,359
kind of approach something

294
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,719
as if it's the most important thing

295
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,719
and you execute it in the best

296
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,759
possible way, which means that

297
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,679
if someone's asked you to do this,

298
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,519
you will do something here. Right?

299
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,240
Like way beyond,

300
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,200
think out of the box

301
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,040
and most importantly, execute.

302
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,480
Right?

303
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,040
That is a critical thing.

304
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,400
And I was lucky enough also to, again,

305
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
to work in a company

306
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,240
that embraced innovation

307
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,160
and embraced execution.

308
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,840
So, when my manager saw

309
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,080
that I'm capable of executing that,

310
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,440
he gave me more challenges.

311
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,640
So, the next challenge that I got was

312
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,520
to launch a brand new idea that Gett had.

313
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,880
It was right at the time

314
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:07,719
that Gett changed its name

315
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,999
from Get Taxi to Gett.

316
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,399
And they had this crazy idea

317
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,839
that Gett can get you anything.

318
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,680
So, you can get pizza on demand,

319
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,360
flowers on demand,

320
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,480
courier on demand

321
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:21,759
to do deliveries for you.

322
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,599
And my manager asked me

323
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,399
if you want to launch it,

324
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,199
it's sounds big,

325
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,879
it was just me doing everything,

326
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,959
seeing what we can do.

327
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,359
And that's how I started,

328
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,279
you know, that was the first step

329
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,039
in launching the first startup

330
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,839
within startup.

331
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,079
We started by launching

332
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,000
verticals at Gett,

333
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,319
different products

334
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,520
that you can get on demand.

335
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,359
And I remember

336
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,839
we had to do everything. Right?

337
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,479
Like engage with couriers.

338
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,479
We wanted to register them.

339
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,999
So we went and downloaded

340
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,679
like a freemium form online

341
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,639
and ask the couriers

342
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,559
to use the free form to register.

343
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,319
And then we brought them in

344
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,759
to do some kind of training session,

345
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,559
how to use the app.

346
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,999
So, you actually have to do everything

347
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,909
exactly like building a startup in your device.

348
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,879
Exactly like building a startup.

349
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,319
Right.

350
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,839
It's just did you do it within

351
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,799
an already operating company.

352
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,319
Obviously, you can leverage some

353
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,439
of the tools that exist,

354
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,879
but in most cases you really

355
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,359
have to do everything as if it's

356
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,160
the first time for the company.

357
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,799
So, I have been doing that

358
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,919
for several months after several months.

359
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,519
I think I had to learn

360
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,119
one of the greatest lessons,

361
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,799
which was to decide

362
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,719
what we do not do.

363
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,559
We started to do all

364
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,879
of this kind of crazy pizza sushi stuff

365
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,680
in 10 minutes,

366
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,960
but we had to acknowledge that

367
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,079
not all of these kind of channels

368
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,399
or services actually work.

369
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,559
And the only thing that actually

370
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,599
was well adopted

371
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,559
by the market in Israel,

372
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,719
but also in other markets

373
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,679
was the courier service.

374
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,359
So back then, so we decided

375
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,479
to kind of shut down all

376
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,479
of the products on demand.

377
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,479
Because getting flowers

378
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,839
in 10 minutes is cool.

379
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,079
But, you know, many people will pay

380
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,559
a little bit more to get

381
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,719
the specific bouquet

382
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,959
that they want, even if

383
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,599
they need to wait three hours.

384
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:26,999
Right?

385
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,679
That's an interesting

386
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,199
behavior observation.

387
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,919
And first of all, before you continue,

388
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,759
I have to say thank you,

389
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,439
because I am probably one

390
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,399
of the biggest users of Gett delivery

391
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,786
in my day to day life.

392
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:42,359
It completely changed

393
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,319
the way I think about logistics.

394
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,279
And I think that especially

395
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,599
for people that are busy

396
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,359
and they have stuff to do.

397
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,519
One of the things

398
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,666
that have been fascinating for me

399
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,840
over this past decade or so

400
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,360
is the amount of tools that are

401
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,000
at our disposal

402
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,880
to make our days more efficient.

403
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
And all of a sudden, you know,

404
00:12:58,881 --> 00:13:01,159
10 years ago, if you were to ask somebody

405
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,079
if they have an alternative to go

406
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,199
to the store or drive 20 minutes

407
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,159
to the flower store

408
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,359
to pick up something

409
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,280
and bring it back,

410
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,560
there was no dilemma.

411
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,562
You have to do it.

412
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:13,079
Now, with the introduction of Gett delivery

413
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,960
and other services,

414
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,480
the whole consumer mindset has shifted.

415
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,440
And I really think that Get Delivery

416
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,040
had a pivotal role

417
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,677
in educating the market on that.

418
00:13:21,877 --> 00:13:23,160
Educating consumer behavior.

419
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,600
You educated me

420
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,080
into thinking more critically about

421
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,000
what can I use technology for

422
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,680
in my day to day life

423
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,160
and what not.

424
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,920
So, thank you Keren.

425
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,360
And I'm already so happy

426
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:33,960
that we got to meet.

427
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:36,359
So, I just want to say thank you.

428
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,079
I'm happy to hear.

429
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,719
There's nothing

430
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,920
that makes me happier

431
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:42,439
than hearing people saying how

432
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,000
they like the service.

433
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,880
Obviously, I use it a lot as well.

434
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,680
But yes, I agree.

435
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:50,640
I think that Gett delivery kind of

436
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,079
you know, brings that

437
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,559
the importance of our time, right?

438
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,759
If we can save time

439
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,919
and use technology

440
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,879
to do stuff for us, that's amazing.

441
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,679
And I think it's something

442
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,239
that in the past

443
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,600
it did not exist at all.

444
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,439
A lot of the time,

445
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,199
most stores, most small businesses

446
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,479
don't have delivery service.

447
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,119
So, you're actually opening up

448
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,279
the a whole market.

449
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,079
Because if I now need

450
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,399
to get some plumbing equipment

451
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,919
from a few streets away,

452
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,199
then the only way before was

453
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,040
to go physically.

454
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,800
But please continue

455
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,520
with your journey.

456
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,800
Right?

457
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,280
Yes.

458
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,520
So, back to Gett delivery.

459
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:31,959
So back then, we had to decide,

460
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,440
like, I had to decide

461
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,240
to shut down some of the activities.

462
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,360
It's never a fun decision to decide that.

463
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,920
But I think that it was another kind

464
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,080
of step in the journey

465
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,039
to prove again to the company

466
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,519
that I'm capable

467
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,959
in the same way that I'm capable

468
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,159
of taking new stuff and trying them,

469
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,559
it's also okay to come and say,

470
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,479
look, this thing doesn't work,

471
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,639
this thing works better.

472
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,920
Let's double down on what works.

473
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,239
So, yeah, so we invest in more

474
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,879
in Gett delivery.

475
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,724
We expanded the service.

476
00:15:04,924 --> 00:15:06,960
At this time, I was also promoted

477
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,240
to lead Gett delivery globally,

478
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,200
also in the UK and in Russia.

479
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,560
So, for the first time in my life,

480
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,400
I had to manage teams abroad

481
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:17,439
and hire people in different countries,

482
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,880
different cultures, different languages,

483
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,400
which was another critical step.

484
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,560
What was the hardest part

485
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,800
about shutting down some products?

486
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,880
So, taking that ownership

487
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,640
and what I'm hearing

488
00:15:30,641 --> 00:15:32,039
in between the lines here

489
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,439
is that this was also kind

490
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,319
of a pivotal role in your career

491
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,279
as your not just this entrepreneur

492
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,079
that is excited and growing things

493
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,319
and saying, let's just run.

494
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,999
But you're also taking that accountability,

495
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,799
that leadership ownership over things

496
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,099
that aren't necessarily working

497
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,141
and saying to the company,

498
00:15:48,341 --> 00:15:50,040
listen, this is my initiative.

499
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,280
Some worked, some didn't,

500
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,640
but I'm taking accountability

501
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,120
and I want us to succeed.

502
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,480
So, we have to be honest

503
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,360
and be intentional

504
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,000
with what we're doing.

505
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,240
Right.

506
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:00,999
Look, so first of all, again,

507
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,239
I was fortunate to have a manager

508
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,559
who is also a mentor and a coach.

509
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,239
It's Dave Wiser, the co-founder of Gett.

510
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,639
He was my direct manager

511
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,399
for the past five and a half years.

512
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,599
So obviously,

513
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,840
a lot of the things with things

514
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,120
that he can and challenge me to think,

515
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,520
on whether I could be more successful,

516
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,480
focusing on what works

517
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,720
and in general, in Gett,

518
00:16:24,721 --> 00:16:26,199
it's something that we do quite a lot,

519
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,440
is to look at the data,

520
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,880
look at the numbers

521
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,000
and enforce ourselves

522
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,200
to kind of really think

523
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,360
what business decisions

524
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,600
we need to take based on this data.

525
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,080
Now, I'm not saying that everything

526
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,040
has to be solely based on data.

527
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,560
You always have to bring also

528
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,480
your own point of view.

529
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,920
And obviously,

530
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,960
I'm also a firm believer

531
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,000
that even intuition

532
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,560
has something to do with it.

533
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,200
But when you have clear facts

534
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,760
and you look at the numbers, you know,

535
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,680
it makes it easier.

536
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,440
By the way, shutting down the ventures

537
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,200
wasn't the most difficult thing.

538
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:00,639
Like, later on in my career,

539
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,040
we launched more ventures

540
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,880
and we had to close them as well.

541
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,120
And I'm talking about units

542
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:09,239
that got to be something like

543
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,679
30 people working on it.

544
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,279
So, yeah.

545
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,679
So, it happens, right?

546
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,639
If you allow yourself

547
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,599
to be innovative,

548
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,039
to try new things,

549
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,839
you just have to take into consideration

550
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,639
that some things works

551
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,439
amazingly well

552
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,479
but some just don't.

553
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,719
And if it doesn't work,

554
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,919
then you better shut it down

555
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,679
and move on.

556
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,719
Otherwise, it were just going to drag you,

557
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:38,799
pretty much drag you down.

558
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,799
100%.

559
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,519
Now, obviously,

560
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,159
you are an incredible entrepreneur

561
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,919
and you made an intentional decision

562
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,039
to be an entrepreneur

563
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,359
within an organization like Gett.

564
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,919
So, you founded these startups

565
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,559
within the larger organization of Gett.

566
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,559
And obviously it must have crossed

567
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,400
your mind saying, look, you know,

568
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,560
if I'm starting new startups here,

569
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,320
maybe like, you know,

570
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,160
I could just start

571
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,520
a startup on my own

572
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,800
and be an entrepreneur there.

573
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:03,919
What was your thinking

574
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,559
and why did you decide to do

575
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,600
it within a larger company?

576
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,960
So, that's a great question because,

577
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,320
you know, it took me a very long time

578
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,400
to be able to say it very openly, because

579
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,000
I do consider myself as an entrepreneur

580
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,240
to come and say, you know,

581
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,760
I believe that I bring a better version

582
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,160
of myself by being an entrepreneur.

583
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,400
Because I need

584
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,040
the environment that allows me

585
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,279
to be innovative rather

586
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,440
than starting something from scratch.

587
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,160
Now, I'm not saying

588
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,600
that in five years from today,

589
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,240
I may find myself, you know,

590
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,920
starting my own startup from scratch.

591
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,080
But, you know, the understanding that

592
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,840
you can be an entrepreneur inside

593
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,720
a company was something that for me

594
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,960
was a great revolution.

595
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,720
And I would love to share it because

596
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,880
I think that there are many people

597
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,400
that from one hand,

598
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,320
they feel this urge inside of them

599
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,200
of doing new things

600
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,040
and thinking outside

601
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,840
of the box and just to come

602
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,960
and be another person in a big

603
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,800
or small company,

604
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,120
but to do something unique.

605
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,920
But on the other hand,

606
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,360
they don't feel ready

607
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,000
or they don't feel that

608
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,160
what they want is

609
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,560
to start something from scratch.

610
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,600
And they don't feel also

611
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,240
that they want to join a company

612
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:21,359
of three people because

613
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,799
they need something more stable.

614
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,680
And the fact that

615
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,120
you can actually be

616
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,520
what I call entrepreneur.

617
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,200
And by the way, in my mind,

618
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,160
the definition of entrepreneur is

619
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,160
working for a company, building stuff

620
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,080
and acting as if you are the owner.

621
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,400
So you don't see yourself

622
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,080
as another employee.

623
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,520
You see yourself as the owner.

624
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,360
You see yourself in the same way as

625
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,000
the founder sees himself or herself.

626
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,320
And that's how you can operate.

627
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,000
You think in the same way

628
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,760
that the founder will think

629
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,160
it's just that you work for a company.

630
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,840
And the thing is

631
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,200
that for the founder,

632
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,359
this type of people,

633
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,319
the entrepreneurs,

634
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,359
they're the best kind of employees.

635
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:05,640
Right?

636
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:08,599
Because any founder would want

637
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,319
his team to be, you know, of people

638
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,559
that sees the company

639
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,439
as if it was their own.

640
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,800
I love it.

641
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,479
And to me, it was a great kind of,

642
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,319
just a great understanding that

643
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,559
I can feel comfortable

644
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,079
bringing my entrepreneurship urge,

645
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,661
you would call it,

646
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,120
just to be inside a company

647
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,960
rather than just building something

648
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:36,520
of my own.

649
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,960
I think that's inspiring

650
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,880
and that's a message

651
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,640
that a lot of people,

652
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:41,159
I think, need to hear right now.

653
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,559
There is, I think,

654
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,359
an understanding

655
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,840
or this motivation by a lot

656
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,400
of people that say,

657
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,880
Okay, if you want to be innovative

658
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,720
and create something

659
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,040
and be an entrepreneur,

660
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:53,599
you need to leave the comfortable company

661
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,039
that you love, perhaps,

662
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,039
and the people

663
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,319
that you work with that you love.

664
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,079
And you have to go on this lonely route

665
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,920
of being an entrepreneur.

666
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,640
And that's not necessarily the case.

667
00:21:01,641 --> 00:21:03,039
I was just talking with

668
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,519
the chief revenue officer of HIPPO

669
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,119
where I work.

670
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,879
And we were talking late last night about

671
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,119
the different initiatives.

672
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,239
And he just got so excited

673
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,559
by all these different startups

674
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,703
that we're about to start

675
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:14,439
within the company.

676
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,160
And he said, you know,

677
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,679
"If you want to be an entrepreneur,

678
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,599
you don't have to go

679
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,279
and be on this lone soldier out there."

680
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,217
I think it can also do it

681
00:21:22,418 --> 00:21:23,339
within the community

682
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:24,720
of a very supportive company

683
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,680
with the resources of the company

684
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,200
and still have a huge impact

685
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,600
and be an entrepreneur,

686
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,319
which is just phenomenal.

687
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,080
Keren, I want to really thank you.

688
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,918
I really want to thank you

689
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:35,120
for being so generous with your time.

690
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,480
I know how busy you are

691
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,800
and I really appreciate that.

692
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,600
And before we leave,

693
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:40,479
I have to ask you for three words

694
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,360
that you would use to describe yourself.

695
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,320
Okay.

696
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,839
Yeah, so that was a tough one.

697
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,239
The hardest one.

698
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,560
Yes, I think that I would go with,

699
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,560
find your passion.

700
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,199
Because one of the things

701
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,999
that I've learned during my career,

702
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,959
comparing also the different roles

703
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,799
that I got to do during the years,

704
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,519
is that when you're passionate

705
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,999
about what you're doing,

706
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,519
it's like you're a different person.

707
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,439
Nothing is difficult enough.

708
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,439
Nothing is hard enough.

709
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,959
Everything is possible.

710
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,039
When you are not passionate,

711
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,719
everything becomes, not everything,

712
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,199
but things become a hassle.

713
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,759
Things become more difficult.

714
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,439
Everything becomes confusing.

715
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,799
And it's possible

716
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,519
to find your passion.

717
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,919
It took me

718
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,439
I think five or six years before

719
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,599
I really got this feeling

720
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,839
of saying, wow,

721
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,879
I'm so passionate about what I'm doing.

722
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,360
I cannot get enough of it.

723
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,879
So that's my choice.

724
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,319
I love it.

725
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,069
Keren, toda raba.

726
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,399
Thank you very, very much.

727
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,559
Continue doing amazing things

728
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,959
for Gett, for Israel,

729
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,799
for me as a consumer

730
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,672
and for businesses as consumers.

731
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:56,839
And stay safe and stay healthy.

732
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,919
Thank you. You too.

733
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:03,760
Thank you very much.
