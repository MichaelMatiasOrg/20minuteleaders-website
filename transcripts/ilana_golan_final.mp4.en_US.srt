1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,439
I wish I had that

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,199
because it's so lonely at the top

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,719
and it's so lonely when you're

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,879
a high achiever

5
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,959
and it's so hard for you

6
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,399
to admit that you need help.

7
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,599
And just having someone to talk to

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,519
that has been there

9
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,479
and walk the walk,

10
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,000
not just talk the talk

11
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:17,100
is a big difference.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,727
Ilana Golan,

13
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:45,959
welcome to 20 Minute Leaders.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,440
How are you?

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,239
Thank you.

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,439
It's amazing to be here.

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,239
I've been watching

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,559
your shows every time

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,639
and I just love it so.

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,119
That warms my heart.

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,519
Thank you very, very much.

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,919
It's an honor and a pleasure

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,359
to have you here as a guest.

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,120
An entrepreneur at heart.

25
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:03,999
An entrepreneur with the ventures,

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,079
with an acquired venture

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,279
behind you already.

28
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,879
But with a lot of different,

29
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,679
really interesting transitions

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,039
along your career.

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,519
And I'm particularly excited

32
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,520
to talk about your journey,

33
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:14,599
the insights you've gained

34
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,479
from the twists and turns,

35
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,839
the ups and downs

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,480
leading up to Golan Ventures

37
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:20,719
and to CareerLeap,

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,999
which obviously is probably one

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,279
of the most important conversations

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,520
to be held in the midst

41
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:27,599
of a pandemic.

42
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,920
So, Ilana, take it away.

43
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:30,599
Who are you

44
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,240
and how do you even get started

45
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:33,079
into this world?

46
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,959
So, engineer, tech,

47
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,760
you know, I've been in tech for a while

48
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,800
and kind of moved up the chain

49
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,640
from big companies like Intel

50
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,040
to smaller companies and startups.

51
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,840
Product, sales, kind of moved up

52
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,560
the chain all the way to vice president.

53
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,680
All across the board.

54
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,960
All across the board.

55
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,600
Leap to entrepreneurship

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,080
with some ups and downs.

57
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,079
Eventually, you know,

58
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,319
my company was acquired.

59
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,800
I moved to the venture side,

60
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,120
and now I'm a public speaker

61
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,280
and Forbes contributor.

62
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,640
And I decided to just

63
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,440
take all this knowledge

64
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:08,119
and help others do the same.

65
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
Because I realized

66
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,680
that leaping in career is something

67
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,880
that I somehow know how to do

68
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:15,280
and I want to help others.

69
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:16,480
So.

70
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,519
I love it.

71
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,399
You ended up getting

72
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,119
to the realization

73
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,800
that you really love helping people,

74
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:24,079
understand what they can do

75
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,079
and deal with that difficult moment.

76
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,040
I have to say that many entrepreneurs

77
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,159
that I know, most entrepreneurs

78
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,639
that I know,

79
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,765
they are tech executives,

80
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:32,119
they've had businesses before,

81
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,359
they don't turn to helping others

82
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,319
as a full time job.

83
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,000
So, what really motivated you

84
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,240
to go and decide,

85
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,800
now I'm going to spend

86
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,200
most of my time helping other people

87
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
realize what they need to do?

88
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,240
It's amazing question.

89
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,480
You know, and I honestly contemplated

90
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,120
with this for a long time,

91
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,720
like it's something I wanted to do.

92
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,000
And I was somewhat scared to do it.

93
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,120
And it was like somewhat,

94
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,880
I used to be kind

95
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,160
of this business woman

96
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,280
and I going to be what,

97
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,560
like a coach

98
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,800
or I wasn't even sure I like coaching,

99
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,600
and I don't even see myself

100
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,120
as a coach.

101
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,040
I see myself more

102
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,240
as a growth strategist.

103
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,600
So, I wasn't really sure

104
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,760
if this is the right thing,

105
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:14,039
but I found myself

106
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,559
just helping a lot of people

107
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,279
on the phone.

108
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,879
And honestly,

109
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,999
you can't help a person

110
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,959
to leap in their career over coffee.

111
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,239
Like it just doesn't work.

112
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,119
First of all, you can't scale and be,

113
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,440
it's not a one time thing.

114
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,720
Like it's a journey

115
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:27,639
and you have to be

116
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,600
there with them on the journey.

117
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:31,759
And, you know, and I was looking

118
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,199
for a good way to do that.

119
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,279
And eventually I just found

120
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,079
that I love doing this.

121
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,999
I love to see people transform.

122
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,439
I love to see people change.

123
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,559
And I wish I had that

124
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,359
because it's so lonely at the top.

125
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,679
And it's so lonely when

126
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,039
you're a high achiever

127
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,079
and it's so hard for you

128
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,519
to admit that you need help.

129
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,759
And just having someone to talk to

130
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,639
that has been there

131
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,599
and walk the walk,

132
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,119
not just talk the talk

133
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,559
is a big difference.

134
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,959
Walk me through that relationship.

135
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,919
That conversation

136
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,119
that I might have with you

137
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,959
as I need to make that leap.

138
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,079
Now and before that

139
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,759
dumb it down for me a little bit,

140
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,679
what does it mean for a person

141
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,679
to want to make that leap?

142
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,559
Does it mean that

143
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,239
they are looking for different jobs,

144
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,120
they're not fulfilled,

145
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,360
they think they can get higher

146
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,560
to where they are today?

147
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,119
What does that entail?

148
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,639
Yeah. Basically, bingo.

149
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,720
Like it's everything you just said, right?

150
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,920
I mean, it's usually

151
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:25,519
the high achievers, right?

152
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,079
It's the people who are looking forward

153
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,159
and saying, you know what,

154
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,639
there must be more to life

155
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,319
than what this is.

156
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,840
And I could be doing more.

157
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,639
And I want to live more of a legacy

158
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,399
and I want to make more of an impact.

159
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,440
And I want to do something that matters.

160
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,720
And, you know, I'm probably

161
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,080
at the last quarter of my career

162
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,440
and I need to make it count.

163
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,760
At least two three quarters, Ilana.

164
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,320
At least two, three quarters.

165
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,240
So, yes.

166
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,800
So, I want to make it count.

167
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
And you know,

168
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,360
and I remembered it for myself

169
00:04:59,361 --> 00:05:00,319
because I used to wake up

170
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,759
in the middle of the night

171
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,839
and like, it can't be

172
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,600
that this is it.

173
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,520
Like it can't be.

174
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,680
I'm overachiever and yes,

175
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm doing amazing things.

176
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,640
But what's next?

177
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,160
Like what's the next big thing?

178
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,640
And, you know, just

179
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,240
So, what I'm hearing from you

180
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:15,159
is something that I'm starting to pick up

181
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,240
from all the different episodes.

182
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,960
And that is some of that

183
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,560
innate curiosity and passion

184
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:20,719
that is burning inside you.

185
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,400
And you're saying, yes.

186
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,640
I'm doing all these things,

187
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,960
I'm vice president of this

188
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:24,879
and I'm executive of this,

189
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,279
and I founded this company.

190
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,879
But you're looking

191
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,719
to really understand

192
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,600
how do I make that tangible impact

193
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,840
on somebody

194
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,080
and know that impact.

195
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,719
So, my question then Ilana is,

196
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,639
what is that impact?

197
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,439
What is the impact of helping people

198
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,279
make that leap in their careers?

199
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,359
How does that even translate

200
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,200
to tangible impact?

201
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:44,879
Right.

202
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,280
So, I mean, first of all,

203
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:47,559
just seeing someone

204
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,079
that they're basically

205
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,239
almost turned off

206
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,080
when you meet them, initially.

207
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,720
You know, they're unfulfilled,

208
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,920
they're unmotivated.

209
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,120
They honestly take it usually home.

210
00:05:58,121 --> 00:06:00,759
They're not as happy as a person.

211
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,159
They don't exercise as much

212
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,639
or not as healthy as they want to be.

213
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,930
Like everything is kind of

214
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:07,119
like a downhill spiral.

215
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,879
And I was in that downhill spiral.

216
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,279
Right?

217
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,839
You were?

218
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,039
So, I feel it. Yeah.

219
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,280
Why were you in the downward spiral?

220
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,519
Story time.

221
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,959
Oh my God.

222
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,999
So, yeah.

223
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,919
So, I mean in a quick few seconds.

224
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,960
We have time Ilana, we have hours.

225
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,999
I know. You're like counting.

226
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,319
So, I was already vice president.

227
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,679
I started the US operation

228
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,679
technical operation

229
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,559
of an Israeli startup here.

230
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,040
It grew to 15 million.

231
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,279
It was an amazing success.

232
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,679
And then I wanted kind of that

233
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,879
what's next. Right?

234
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
So, I wanted to leap to entrepreneurship.

235
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,400
Somebody I knew from the Technion

236
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,920
wanted to do this together,

237
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,280
build it kind of in the off hours,

238
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,800
raise money, $800,000.

239
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,320
And right when I

240
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,280
basically did a big party

241
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,760
for my previous job

242
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:03,439
and to tell them about the startup,

243
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,719
the same day he kicked me out.

244
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,400
So, he took the money,

245
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,520
kicked me out of business,

246
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,240
and at some point

247
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,520
within seconds or a day,

248
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,560
I was left with nothing

249
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,120
like no job, no salary,

250
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,160
no startup, no investment.

251
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,880
And I felt like the earth

252
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,320
just like fell from under me. Right?

253
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:21,199
So, it's that point.

254
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,520
It's like, sorry for the language,

255
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,720
the holy shit moment.

256
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,040
It's like you wake up and,

257
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,679
what do you do?

258
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,639
Like what do I do?

259
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,439
Do I look for a job?

260
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,400
Do I look for a co-founder?

261
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,360
Or do I start a business?

262
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,520
Like what do you do.

263
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,360
And you know, you don't have

264
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:36,959
to have these big moments

265
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,599
to really feel like,

266
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,679
oh my God, I need more than this.

267
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,759
And I've had those small moments

268
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,719
in my life as well.

269
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,959
Like you as an engineer,

270
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,340
you're many times stuck

271
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,719
as a technical person.

272
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,399
And then you know,

273
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,560
you move to like product

274
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:53,839
and then you're stuck as a product.

275
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,279
So, you keep on getting stuck

276
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,719
because you're good at it.

277
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:56,960
Right?

278
00:07:56,961 --> 00:07:57,719
The question is,

279
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,519
how do you get unstuck?

280
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,239
And it's a lot about reputation

281
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,519
and network these days.

282
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,519
So, that's really what plays a role.

283
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,759
And the way people

284
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,879
are finding opportunities is different

285
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,799
than it used to be.

286
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,079
So, people will reinvent themselves

287
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,159
every year or two.

288
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,279
And it's add to your skill. You need to learn.

289
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,520
Right.

290
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,640
So, we're talking about a new reality.

291
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:17,359
You know, it's not just

292
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,639
that we're living in covid times,

293
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,039
but I believe the trend,

294
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,680
especially in the tech sector,

295
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:23,239
is that every two years

296
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,760
people change positions

297
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,600
for good and for bad,

298
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,720
which means that

299
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,480
a lot more people have

300
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,360
the potential to reach

301
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:29,719
that unstuck moment.

302
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,520
Because if all of my friends

303
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,920
are advancing every two years

304
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:34,399
and it's my turn to advance like,

305
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,520
holy shit, I need to be advancing

306
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,760
just like my friends.

307
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,480
How do you get unstuck?

308
00:08:39,481 --> 00:08:40,479
Walk me through some of the,

309
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,879
you know, some of the big pointers

310
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,759
for anybody that may be stuck

311
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,680
that is present here with us.

312
00:08:46,681 --> 00:08:47,160
Right.

313
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:48,359
And I'll say a few things.

314
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,159
So, first of all,

315
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,879
again, we will reinvent ourselves

316
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,799
every year or two.

317
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,639
And it's a skill,

318
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,719
but nobody teaches you the skill.

319
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,599
And what's more interesting is that

320
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,959
the roles that you're looking at,

321
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,559
especially in the tech sectors,

322
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,340
nobody really taught you marketing

323
00:09:04,341 --> 00:09:06,399
or that kind of skills,

324
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,479
or that kind of management.

325
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,199
Like, you don't learn that in school.

326
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,319
It's really experiences.

327
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,079
And then you get into

328
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,959
that chicken and egg.

329
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,159
Like, but you don't have the experience.

330
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,719
So, how can you do that. Right?

331
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,079
So, the interesting part there is,

332
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,599
how do you fast track

333
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,519
to get those experiences

334
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,319
so that you can claim it

335
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,919
and you can have the confidence

336
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,519
and you can build that reputation

337
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,799
so that your network

338
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,760
will open these opportunities your way.

339
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,960
And that's how you leap.

340
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:34,279
So, the unstuck is basically

341
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,479
to figure out, first of all,

342
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,719
what you want to do

343
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,040
and which is crucial.

344
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,759
Sometimes I look at it as experiments,

345
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,279
just like startups experiment

346
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,079
to figure out their market, you know,

347
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,159
like, where they want to go next.

348
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,599
Your go-to-market strategy,

349
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,079
that's the same thing.

350
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,599
You experiment with your career.

351
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,399
You figure out one thing,

352
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,599
you try it out.

353
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,719
You see if it works.

354
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,559
You start building your

355
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,999
reputation network accordingly.

356
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,519
If you don't like it, change it.

357
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,039
The beautiful thing is,

358
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,399
I say it to the leapers,

359
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,759
In 2007, we all became a media company,

360
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,639
and whether you like it or not,

361
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,519
if nobody hears from you

362
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,439
the assumption is that

363
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,479
you have nothing to say.

364
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,119
Right?

365
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,159
So, you know but we can leverage this.

366
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,039
We can basically leverage

367
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,879
to tell a new story about ourselves

368
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,559
and its power.

369
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,159
Wow.

370
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,959
How much of that is more is emotional

371
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,599
versus, you know,

372
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,920
mental and intellectual and tangible,

373
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,000
and on just saying, okay.

374
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,720
here's the pros, here's the cons,

375
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,080
and here is what Ilana tells me

376
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,640
that I need to do

377
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,040
so I should just go do it?

378
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:37,600
So, what is the mindset of a person

379
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:40,079
who is a leaper in your mind?

380
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,239
It's a great question

381
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,519
because I think it's exactly

382
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,039
all everything that you just said.

383
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,879
Right?

384
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,559
It's not enough

385
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,559
to just give information these days.

386
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,639
I mean, you have information

387
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,279
on YouTube, right, you don't need to--

388
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,640
Right.

389
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,239
So, it's not about information.

390
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,759
It's really about the transformation

391
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,599
and it's about,

392
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,479
how do you get

393
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,439
to that transformation.

394
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,679
How do you get that kind of ability.

395
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,919
How do you get inspired by people.

396
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,559
How do you learn about opportunities

397
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,719
you didn't even know about.

398
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:03,919
Right?

399
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,120
Because when you're in corporate

400
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,840
and all you see

401
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,200
is that senior director role

402
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,360
that you want,

403
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,400
you didn't even know

404
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,600
that you could mentor

405
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,920
in startup accelerators

406
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:12,919
and join boards

407
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,159
and be adviser like

408
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,199
you didn't even know

409
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,480
that these things exist.

410
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:17,079
Right?

411
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,759
So, it's really about opening your mind

412
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,719
to what's possible,

413
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,119
but also giving you the courage

414
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,159
and the inspiration to move on

415
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,239
and that kind of ability

416
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,479
to keep pushing.

417
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,759
Because when you're scared,

418
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,479
you're going to tend

419
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,679
to lean back to your comfort zone.

420
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,320
So, it's really about everything.

421
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,440
It's a lot of mindset, really.

422
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,600
It's fascinating.

423
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,440
At the end, it's all about fulfillment.

424
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,080
And it's all about the pyramid of Maslow.

425
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,760
Right?

426
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,920
That you want to reach that hierarchy.

427
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,960
And I guess one of the most

428
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,320
difficult parts of it is knowing,

429
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,160
acknowledging that you're stuck.

430
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:50,559
Right?

431
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,040
I'm assuming that

432
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,840
it's very easy to get into a routine

433
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,240
and sort of bending out

434
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,200
because it's first of all,

435
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,360
it's comfortable to have a position,

436
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,160
even if you're a little bit stuck in it,

437
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:02,079
you're stuck often in comfort,

438
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,879
especially in our industry.

439
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,639
So, there's a big part

440
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,399
from when you are stuck

441
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,360
to when you go to Ilana Golan

442
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,200
and she helps you get unstuck.

443
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,680
I agree.

444
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,360
And honestly, I do.

445
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,480
The big thing that I tell people is

446
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,000
that life is in phases.

447
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,480
And in different phases

448
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,120
different things will

449
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,280
be important for us.

450
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,160
And sometimes it's really

451
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,400
about finance and comfort and balance.

452
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:27,239
And that's okay.

453
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,759
You know, as long as you're admitting

454
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,080
that this is what's important for you

455
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,560
right now and this part is okay,

456
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,800
then it's okay.

457
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,160
Right?

458
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,320
So, when I was in a big corporate

459
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,520
and I knew that I'm going

460
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,400
to have two children

461
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
and I'm going to take

462
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,840
two maternity leave

463
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,360
and I wanted to run an Ironman

464
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,760
and all sorts of things,

465
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,800
then, you know,

466
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,440
it was okay for me to be stuck

467
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,720
because I wasn't stuck.

468
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,800
I was doing the things

469
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,880
that I love to do.

470
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,480
Right?

471
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,560
So, you know, to some extent

472
00:12:54,561 --> 00:12:55,439
you need to decide

473
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,040
what's your must haves.

474
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,920
And once you define

475
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,680
your must haves,

476
00:12:58,681 --> 00:12:59,839
you need to say, okay,

477
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,640
so now this is

478
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,040
what's important for me

479
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,080
and maybe its reputation

480
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:04,239
and maybe its recognition,

481
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,999
maybe its growth

482
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,880
and maybe its more pay,

483
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,120
whatever it is, right?

484
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:08,920
Now, go chase it.

485
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,079
So, the question

486
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,319
that I have to ask is,

487
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,400
executive in tech,

488
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,600
two kids and an Ironman,

489
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,360
how does that work?

490
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,800
Well, first of all, I have to admit

491
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:21,480
the Ironman was before the two kids.

492
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,960
But yes.

493
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,320
No. I am, I need to be busy.

494
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,000
I see that.

495
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,480
I can see that very clearly.

496
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,600
But that's life, you know, like,

497
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,640
I just want to make things happen.

498
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,560
You know, I decide on a goal

499
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:40,799
and I go pursue it.

500
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,960
But I like to take people with me,

501
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,040
you know, and that's the beautiful part.

502
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,680
So, now that I'm surrounded

503
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,360
with phenomenal leapers

504
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,680
that are like, you know,

505
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,760
I see them growing,

506
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,840
I see them fulfilled,

507
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,960
I'm seeing their eyes

508
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,400
like spark, like it's just,

509
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,560
something that I don't think

510
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,200
I've ever felt before.

511
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,480
And it's, you know,

512
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,520
it's first of all, it's fulfillment.

513
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,720
It's you feel like you're impactful.

514
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,160
And beyond that, it's you know,

515
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:07,359
it's the financial freedom

516
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,720
and the geography freedom

517
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
that I wanted for myself

518
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,680
so that I can keep on traveling the world

519
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,880
and still inspiring

520
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,240
and making a lot of money.

521
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,280
So, it's great.

522
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,040
I love it.

523
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:16,919
Circling back because

524
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,599
that is a question

525
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,200
that I'm fascinated by.

526
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,680
I'm assuming

527
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,720
that most people in the world

528
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,240
that I mean,

529
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,960
I'm assuming that the people

530
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,880
that are already talking to you

531
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,440
that are stuck,

532
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,800
they are the top percentile

533
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,840
that have acknowledged it

534
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
and are making that leap.

535
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:31,479
But there is a whole level of people

536
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,519
that are stuck

537
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,440
and they're just

538
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,200
maybe they're not

539
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,720
they don't know it

540
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,120
or they don't know

541
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,360
what to do about it.

542
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,760
How can you tell if a person is

543
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:41,799
exhibiting the symptoms of stuckness?

544
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,479
Or the person who has the potential

545
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,559
to make that leap

546
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,440
but just doesn't realize it yet?

547
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,280
It's a great question.

548
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
I mean, first of all,

549
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,040
I have to say

550
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,280
that I accept roughly

551
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,360
1 out of 5 people

552
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,600
that I talk to.

553
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,640
Really?

554
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:57,239
Yeah. I am very, very picky.

555
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,159
And the reason is

556
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,320
I want the people

557
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,440
to have enough of

558
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,200
the goal needs to be

559
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,920
realistic, but high.

560
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,280
Right?

561
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,360
And they need to be committed.

562
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,320
They need to be driven.

563
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,440
They need to be coachable,

564
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,560
resourceful, etc.

565
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:11,920
Right?

566
00:15:11,921 --> 00:15:14,999
So, there is a certain type of people

567
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,120
that I like working with.

568
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,760
It's definitely more the high achievers

569
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,080
in that top percentile.

570
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,080
You know, people sometimes, again,

571
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,800
they will feel stuck for a while.

572
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,400
But sometimes, like I said,

573
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,360
it's comfortable.

574
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,760
And we said that. Right?

575
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,640
But sometimes

576
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,960
it literally wakes you up

577
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:32,879
in the middle of the night

578
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,920
or wakes you up.

579
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,440
You see that you're anxious

580
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,200
or you're not yourself

581
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,600
and you're not

582
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,880
the best version of yourself.

583
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,720
And at that point, it's you know,

584
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,520
it took me many years

585
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,880
to ask for help.

586
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,600
Now I have my own coaching

587
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,800
and I pay crazy amounts for it.

588
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,040
But it takes me higher.

589
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,520
Right?

590
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,560
And, you know,

591
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,720
I think it took me years

592
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,400
to understand that it's okay,

593
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,440
even though I'm just like

594
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,880
Air Force Girl. Right?

595
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,760
That I probably shouldn't ask for help

596
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,320
and I should just figure it out

597
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,200
and you know, like figure,

598
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,240
kind of prove that I can.

599
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,800
But actually, when I ask for help,

600
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,320
it's going to take me much faster

601
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,800
and much better. Right?

602
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,400
So, it took me many years

603
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,240
to figure it out.

604
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,520
And now I you know,

605
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,840
I want to find the people

606
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,440
that will, you know,

607
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,720
if I give them a hand,

608
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,040
they will take it

609
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,800
and they will work hard

610
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,840
and they will be committed

611
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,360
and they'll get tremendous results.

612
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
It sounds like

613
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,520
it takes a lot of courage

614
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,040
to do both of these sides

615
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,120
to play on both roles, right?

616
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,400
Yeah. It's courage all along.

617
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:34,760
Right?

618
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,960
Because every time you leap,

619
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,520
you're going to be out

620
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,640
of your comfort zone.

621
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,280
So, the question is

622
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,200
what kind of comfort zone

623
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,760
and how big of a leap

624
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,240
are you going to go for?

625
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,280
And leap is scary.

626
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,120
I mean, you're going to do

627
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,040
by definition,

628
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,640
it's something you haven't done before.

629
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:52,959
By definition, it's something bigger.

630
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,960
And you need to decide

631
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,800
that this is what you want for yourself

632
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
and for your family

633
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,040
and for your fulfillment.

634
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,200
So,

635
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,480
yeah, it's not so.

636
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,280
One of the things

637
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:06,319
that I'm still thinking

638
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,919
from a few sentences ago

639
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
is you said

640
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,480
of the term coachable.

641
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,000
I never thought of the coaching as

642
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,600
it's a two sided market.

643
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,720
It's not just that somebody

644
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,760
is willing to pay.

645
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,918
And so, therefore,

646
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:19,960
it's going to be a good fit.

647
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,560
But you need somebody

648
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:21,159
that's coachable,

649
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,920
somebody that you will

650
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,880
enjoy working with,

651
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,280
because just as you're coaching them,

652
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
I'm sure that a part of it

653
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,520
is you're talking about

654
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,000
how you're getting

655
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,480
the fulfillment from them

656
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,600
and you're getting motivated

657
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,280
by seeing them progress.

658
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,560
And so, you need people

659
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
that will feed you

660
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,560
that motivation as well, right?

661
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,160
Absolutely.

662
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,040
If I'm not 200% confident

663
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,000
that I can take them higher,

664
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:41,439
I don't want to work with them,

665
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,639
not because I'm a jackass,

666
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,679
just because I want to see those results.

667
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,799
What I really care about

668
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,959
is their transformation,

669
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,479
I mean, I've had enough, like,

670
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,319
whether one person joins or not

671
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,439
that's not going to move

672
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,599
the needle for me.

673
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,439
But it will be good than to see people

674
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,039
that don't get the results.

675
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,239
So, yeah, I love this.

676
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,839
Just wonderful.

677
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,744
Ilana, thank you so much

678
00:18:03,745 --> 00:18:05,280
for being so generous with your time.

679
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:07,959
It was lovely to have you here.

680
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,719
Before we leave,

681
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,199
I need to ask you for three words

682
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,719
that you would use

683
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,520
to describe yourself.

684
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,519
I think I even said it.

685
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,280
Making things happen.

686
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,800
Making things happen.

687
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:19,719
Yeah, I'm the type,

688
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,079
it doesn't matter if it's a trip

689
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,159
or an adventure

690
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,799
or entrepreneurship

691
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,919
or whatever.

692
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,479
I'm going to make something happen

693
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:26,919
and I'm going

694
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,199
to take people along with me.

695
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,919
So, yeah.

696
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,039
Amazing.

697
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,319
Ilana, thank you very much.

698
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,759
Toda Raba.

699
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,479
Best of luck

700
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,759
and thank you for helping

701
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,079
a lot of people along the way.

702
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,640
It's really great. Take care.
