1
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,790
Okay. Sound's good.

2
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,400
Viki Slavin, how are you?

3
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,680
I'm great.

4
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,360
Good to see you.

5
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,920
So, where are you calling from right now?

6
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
From Tel Aviv.

7
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,520
I'm based in Israel.

8
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,760
But we are working from home.

9
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,400
So, probably you'll find me

10
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,600
in my living room.

11
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,720
I love it. I love it.

12
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,880
So, I think that working from home,

13
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,640
the true answer is, I'm everywhere.

14
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,360
Because now, there is no sense

15
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,520
in a specific point in time.

16
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,440
Viki, I can't wait to hear your story.

17
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,360
Right before we started this,

18
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,400
we were chatting a little bit about

19
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,120
both the idea of mentorship,

20
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,400
but also the idea of the responsibilities

21
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,280
of being an entrepreneur for a good impact

22
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,000
following this idea

23
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,280
of bootstrapping a company.

24
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,760
And I'd love to spend these 20 minutes

25
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,080
touching on these three subjects.

26
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,520
Because I think, they're fascinating.

27
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,920
And I'd love to start with the middle one.

28
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,240
About what it means to be

29
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,800
an entrepreneur to you,

30
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,640
and the privilege of being an entrepreneur

31
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,040
in terms of the responsibility

32
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,080
that we can undertake onto ourselves.

33
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,600
Okay. It's a good question.

34
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,320
I think it's always take ownership.

35
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,840
No matter if you are the expert

36
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,280
of a subject, or a topic,

37
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,280
you must take ownership

38
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,480
because it's yours.

39
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,400
And if stuff cracks between

40
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,160
if something goes wrong,

41
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,760
you need to step in and you can't say,

42
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,480
"Okay. It's not mine."

43
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,650
So, I think that's the main characteristic

44
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,280
of a good entrepreneur.

45
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,800
And a second, not to miss

46
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,120
a good opportunity if you see one.

47
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,640
But, you must say "no"

48
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,140
for almost everything else.

49
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,100
So, that's under intuitive.

50
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,080
Because when you think of entrepreneurship

51
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,840
a lot of the times I think of "yes".

52
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,560
A yes person, right?

53
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,520
Yes-and. Yes-and.

54
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,000
But you're saying that most of the time,

55
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,760
your responsibility is to say "no".

56
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,200
Yes, because you need to stay focused.

57
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,480
And you need to invest yourself,

58
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,120
it's not 100%, it's really 200%.

59
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,360
Because you must take yourself

60
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,320
out of the box.

61
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,640
You must be more creative

62
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,840
than you're expected.

63
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,840
You must encounter in many difficulties.

64
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,280
And many times it will tell you,

65
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
"No, don't do it."

66
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,500
"Why? Why? Why do we need it?"

67
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,200
And you must continue, probably.

68
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,320
So, you're an entrepreneur yourself.

69
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,360
Multiple time entrepreneur.

70
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,440
You're also deep

71
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,800
into the technology scene

72
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,400
and helping companies with

73
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,920
create better technology

74
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,120
through your most recent now

75
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,560
global consulting firm.

76
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,840
That helps them

77
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,360
write software that scales.

78
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,280
Talk to me a little bit about

79
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,400
what this business does.

80
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,000
And then I'd love to go back

81
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,760
all the way to the journey

82
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,680
of how you started it,

83
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,960
how you bootstrapped it

84
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,440
and move from there.

85
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,320
No problem at all.

86
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,200
What we do at ProdOps,

87
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,640
and if you pronounce it correct,

88
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,920
it's a production and operations.

89
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,640
How you can combine both of them.

90
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,240
We help clients to build

91
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,800
and deploy solutions.

92
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,040
To automate the cloud infrastructure

93
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,160
and improve the whole workflow

94
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,200
of how you deliver code.

95
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,120
It's great that you have code, right?

96
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,840
But until it won't leave in the real world

97
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,720
and people won't be able to use it,

98
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,600
it's worth nothing.

99
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,120
It's a backlog.

100
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,720
Okay. So, how do you actually go in

101
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,160
and help these companies?

102
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,440
Because sometimes,

103
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,400
companies that have a dozen engineers,

104
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,360
they have a lot of different systems.

105
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,360
They have a lot of internal conventions.

106
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,760
And it sounds a little complicated

107
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,880
for an external group

108
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,240
to come in and help them understand

109
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,360
what they have and deploy it.

110
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,760
We start from a process,

111
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,960
what they want to achieve.

112
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,640
Okay. Now, and what is the business,

113
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,760
let's call it impact,

114
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,520
that you would like to create.

115
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,840
You want to deliver a feature

116
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,000
that will create that wild moment.

117
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,440
Okay. Let's focus on your user.

118
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,240
Okay. And once you focus on your user,

119
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,280
we explain the flowback.

120
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,160
What do you have in your functionality

121
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,120
of your systems today,

122
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,280
that is good enough

123
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,040
and you can improve it.

124
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,520
And then, let's find ways to improve it.

125
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,280
Is it by a faster delivery.

126
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,320
Is it by creating better feedback loops.

127
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,160
To break feedback, you monitor stuff

128
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,200
and you can fix better.

129
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,840
Is it by scale to other regions

130
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,920
or countries.

131
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,160
And is it by use cloud better

132
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,640
and have the opportunity

133
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,760
to scale your systems

134
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,280
and provide good service

135
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,040
in different countries in the same time.

136
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,360
So, we look on the business outcomes

137
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,800
that our customers need.

138
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,320
We see what are the bottlenecks

139
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,600
that they have in the process.

140
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,400
And only after we achieved it,

141
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,040
we think if we can consult

142
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
on what do you want.

143
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,440
What practices do you want to be

144
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,480
about clean development.

145
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,600
Is it good for you agile development.

146
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,040
Okay. We are not agile mentors,

147
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,560
but we understand what does it mean.

148
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,200
And what does it mean for an R&D team.

149
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,440
So, it's not just

150
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,960
on the deployment, right?

151
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,840
What you're talking about here

152
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,640
is the whole pipeline of a company

153
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,560
that comes in and says,

154
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,760
"We have software that is helping us

155
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,800
create a service for people."

156
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,760
And you can actually interject

157
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,720
in any part of the pipeline.

158
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,240
Not just the deployment

159
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,840
to the cloud or to the user.

160
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,600
Exactly.

161
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,240
We don't have any, let's call it

162
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,440
added advantage in what you develop,

163
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,320
but how you bring it to your customers.

164
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,280
How you deploy it to your customers.

165
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,200
What is the process

166
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,720
to do it in a better way.

167
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,320
So, why do you need ProdOps?

168
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,880
Why do teams around the world

169
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,640
need an external company

170
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,920
to come in and help them

171
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,320
achieve that goal?

172
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,200
Because it sounds like,

173
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,200
today, you have DevOps internally,

174
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,960
you have different

175
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,360
scrum masters internally.

176
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,160
Why would I want an external firm

177
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,040
to come in and help me?

178
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,640
Okay. Because you find yourself

179
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,760
dealing with a lot of backlog around you.

180
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,800
You can always probably say,

181
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,600
"Okay. I have a lot of work."

182
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,440
"How do I start?"

183
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,120
"How can I create a different?"

184
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,440
Because I need to do the maintenance.

185
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,480
I need to do the work.

186
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,000
Okay. I can step back and look at it

187
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,720
from another angle.

188
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,640
And I need someone experience

189
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,160
that will help me to do it.

190
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,500
It's first.

191
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,040
Second, to overcome technical challenges.

192
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,760
It takes a lot of time.

193
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,640
It's not that you can call yourself,

194
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,480
you are a Java developer.

195
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,160
Great. So, you will know new stuff

196
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,560
that happens with Java, for example.

197
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,880
But it's not Java.

198
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,000
You have in cloud, native landscape.

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,880
A lot of tools.

200
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,240
And each one of them can, let's call it,

201
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,120
take you a step forward.

202
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,960
What tool do you need to use now.

203
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,480
How can you use a tool

204
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,400
that won't add complexity

205
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,280
more than it needs.

206
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:22,160
So, what it sounds to me is that,

207
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,360
the firm doesn't go in

208
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,600
and you're not completing JIRA tasks,

209
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,840
for the team.

210
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,920
You're not actually going in

211
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,480
and necessarily helping them

212
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,440
code the product.

213
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,160
But you're helping them

214
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,280
understand at a higher level.

215
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,000
How do the different products

216
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,080
within the company serve the customer.

217
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,200
How do you make sure

218
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,080
that the teams work official.

219
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,240
And how do you take a step back

220
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,280
and understand what are the priorities

221
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,000
that the startup or that the enterprise

222
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,160
needs to accomplish

223
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,400
in order to maximize on their value

224
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,040
for their customer.

225
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
Exactly.

226
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,280
And from time to time,

227
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,480
we also step into

228
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,560
the hands-on work itself.

229
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,960
And if we need to help our clients

230
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,680
to scale up his technical capabilities

231
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,600
in the delivery pipeline,

232
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,040
in the cloud infrastructure systems,

233
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,000
we do it as well.

234
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,480
Okay. So, how many people

235
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,360
are part of this group ProdOps?

236
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,080
We have 20 people.

237
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,200
Almost 20 people in Israel,

238
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,560
London and Miami.

239
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,600
Spread into three countries.

240
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,320
Why Miami?

241
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,080
Why Miami?

242
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,760
Yes, it's a good question.

243
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,600
Okay. If you want good relationship

244
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,200
with the wife or your employee,

245
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,560
you need to have a career.

246
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,760
And Ziv, one of our senior directors

247
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,200
wanted to move to the US,

248
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,920
and his wife is a doctor

249
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,800
and she's accepted

250
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,960
to a Miami Beach hospital.

251
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,560
Okay.

252
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,040
So, it's not a bad reason.

253
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,840
It's not such a good decision.

254
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,960
But we live with it, so it's okay.

255
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,800
I love it.

256
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,160
Well, in covid time

257
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,480
Anywhere, they can work anywhere.

258
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,440
And I guess the only issue

259
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,560
is the time difference.

260
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,040
But I guess as an entrepreneur,

261
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,240
you're already very adapt

262
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
to working across time zones

263
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,520
and being awake

264
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,960
at all sorts of weird hours.

265
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,480
Now, I'd love for you

266
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,960
to take me back to your journey.

267
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,080
And before we started this,

268
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,840
you mentioned this idea

269
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,200
of bootstrapping and saying "no".

270
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,080
And saying "no" specifically,

271
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,120
to institutional funding.

272
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,920
Because here in Palo Alto,

273
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,200
all that I'm hearing all day is,

274
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,840
when are you going

275
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,880
to raise your next round;

276
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,520
and how quickly can you raise the round;

277
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,320
and how much money can you raise.

278
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,000
And it sounds to me like you have a story

279
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,960
that doesn't go along

280
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,760
with that narrative specifically, right?

281
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,680
It's only when you need the money

282
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,240
for growth,

283
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,120
you can do it by yourself.

284
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,400
What I think we foretell to ourselves

285
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,200
that we managed to create value

286
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,440
from almost the first day of our work,

287
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,320
and we managed, I think,

288
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,400
to do bootstrap for, let's call it,

289
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,440
for initiatives that we decided to do.

290
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,080
But we take small risks.

291
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,320
There is a price to it.

292
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,760
Okay, we take small risk.

293
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,800
We probably won't be able

294
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,240
to take bigger risk.

295
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,800
But it's good enough for us for now.

296
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
So, how do you manage

297
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,040
that balances an entrepreneur

298
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,560
between taking the money,

299
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,480
being able to go to high risk things

300
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,320
versus bootstrapping,

301
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,520
maintaining ownership

302
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,800
and control of the company

303
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,840
and in the decision making process,

304
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,040
but not being able to take

305
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,280
those big risks?

306
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,680
I will take them when I will,

307
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,880
and I think will know

308
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,240
that it's not eventually,

309
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,800
that it's really the green light for me

310
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,400
that I will be able to scale

311
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,200
because I have the money, okay?

312
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,480
Not because the business need it.

313
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,000
Not a good enough reason.

314
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,080
Okay?

315
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,040
Because I will, let's call it,

316
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,240
have more clients

317
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,400
and I will need more people to sell them.

318
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,200
Right. It's also not a good reason

319
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,480
because if I can sell them

320
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
and I can get money,

321
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,920
why do I need it, it's not my money.

322
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,240
Right. But what is the downside

323
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,680
of getting an institutional investment

324
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,480
and saying at the end,

325
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,840
Now I want to grow my team at ProdOps

326
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,040
from 20 people to 200 people.

327
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,960
And instead of serving a few clients,

328
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,280
I want to serve hundreds of clients.

329
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,720
Because it sounds to me like

330
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,440
you're convinced that you've reached

331
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,240
a product market fit.

332
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,560
And you're providing value

333
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,400
to these companies.

334
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,880
And you're learning

335
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,040
a lot from the process.

336
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,080
Then why not take that leap?

337
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,680
Because I think that our, let's call it,

338
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,560
mid management team,

339
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,560
is not ready for it right now.

340
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,120
Once he'll be ready,

341
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,160
I'll think I'll do it.

342
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,520
So, what you're saying here is that

343
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,080
there's this dilemma for an entrepreneur

344
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,480
where you also need to take account,

345
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,320
are we ready to be able to manage

346
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,720
a company at a greater scale

347
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,440
than what we have.

348
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,320
Are we ready both in terms of our product,

349
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,280
but also in terms of our management.

350
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,880
Yes. Internally, of course.

351
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
So, I can hire. Okay.

352
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,680
Of course, I can go and hire.

353
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,200
But it's not the way we believe

354
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,840
we can do a great, let's call it scale,

355
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,720
for ourselves.

356
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,320
So, one of the things

357
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,480
that institutional investors help with

358
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,520
is keeping the entrepreneur accountable

359
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,760
and keeping a reality check constantly.

360
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,600
Because they're not necessarily

361
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,920
emotionally invested into the idea.

362
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,120
But they're looking at the product

363
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,280
and the value that it provides.

364
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,080
So, how do you then,

365
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,880
as an entrepreneur and the CEO,

366
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
how do you keep

367
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,760
that reality check for yourself

368
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,880
without the help of the VC?

369
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,600
I have a good advisory board

370
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,640
and I have a good mentor.

371
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,640
I think it's always a good tip for anyone.

372
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,600
You need to have an external mentor.

373
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,840
And you're right to be able

374
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,320
to look at his eyes and say,

375
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,080
"Please give me the truth all the time

376
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,520
and check me."

377
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,800
So, I'd love to transition this

378
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,680
to the other part

379
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,560
that we talked about before,

380
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,000
which is mentorship and relationships

381
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,720
as you go along

382
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,840
this entrepreneurial journey

383
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,600
as one of the key milestones,

384
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,280
or cornerstones of an entrepreneur.

385
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,000
So, talk to me a little bit

386
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,800
about the importance of relationship

387
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,520
and mentorship in your eyes.

388
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,520
I think a good mentor

389
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,640
should always ask you the question,

390
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,560
"Is it still your goal?"

391
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,800
And if it's your goal, let's make sure

392
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,440
that every decision that you make

393
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
meets your goal.

394
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,600
Okay. I think it's one of the

395
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,080
main characters of a good mentor.

396
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,840
Second, if in his eyes

397
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,840
you're not in the best position

398
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,760
for your company,

399
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,000
and you're not doing the good job,

400
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,920
he need to tell you,

401
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,560
"You need to move. Think about it."

402
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,240
Consider to make a transition.

403
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,360
Consider how would you like to grow

404
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,040
from this now.

405
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,480
From this point.

406
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,760
Either way, I look at the good mentor

407
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,120
and those are the questions

408
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,880
that I keep asking my mentor all the time.

409
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,800
On every meeting that I think we have

410
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,120
about the strategic topics

411
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,960
that we would like to discuss.

412
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,080
Right. But we obviously

413
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,680
can't take for granted this idea

414
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,920
of finding a good mentor.

415
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,120
So, how do you go about

416
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,320
even finding the right person

417
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,080
to help you on your journey?

418
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,840
Because it's wonderful

419
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,720
to have that person.

420
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,040
But it sounds pretty difficult

421
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,040
to find somebody who's committed

422
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,520
to helping you as an entrepreneur

423
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,000
and giving you

424
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,640
that real honest and direct advice.

425
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,000
Because that takes time and effort.

426
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,120
It takes time and effort

427
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,600
to gain a trust with the person.

428
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,840
Gain a trust, I think

429
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,680
it's the main difficulty.

430
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,720
And believes that

431
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,280
he has added value for you.

432
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,440
I met my one of my great mentors

433
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,200
in a different work, let's call it

434
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,360
from Theory of Constraints Work,

435
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,560
if you're familiar with the practice?

436
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,040
I'm now. What is that?

437
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,000
Okay. Professor Eliyahu Goldratt

438
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,520
wrote a book, The Goal.

439
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,880
Maybe you're familiar with the name,

440
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,600
The Goal?

441
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,880
I'm not familiar. No.

442
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,820
Wow. Okay.

443
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,360
So, you have [--]

444
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,460
No. But yes.

445
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,960
Theory of constraints.

446
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,240
It's a management practice.

447
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,320
Company like Apple and Amazon

448
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,960
work by this practice.

449
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,640
And it's why

450
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,720
they're such a great companies.

451
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,160
Because they find,

452
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,600
let's call it the weakness,

453
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,200
in the whole chain of a process.

454
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,880
And they improve only the one bottleneck

455
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,800
that is the weakest, let's call it,

456
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,280
let's call it in this way,

457
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,400
they find the bottleneck.

458
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,640
Once they find the bottleneck,

459
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,120
they fix it.

460
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
And then they ask you,

461
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,840
"Okay. Is my process improved or not?"

462
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,400
It needs a person that I want in my life.

463
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,120
So, it's because you always keep looking

464
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,920
for the weakest things

465
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,800
that I have in my business.

466
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,480
And then he points on it,

467
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,040
I work very hard to improve it.

468
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,280
So, just to make sure that I understand.

469
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,680
This whole concept is that,

470
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,680
you're looking at your whole supply chain,

471
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,600
whether it's your life,

472
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,840
your business or product.

473
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,360
And you're saying,

474
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,040
"Out of the hundred things

475
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,880
that I'm doing,

476
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,400
maybe 20 of them are bad."

477
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,840
But what is the worst one

478
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
that is really stopping

479
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,480
my company right now from growing?

480
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,680
The weakest link.

481
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,000
Let's capitalize on that.

482
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,320
Solve that and then, remeasure.

483
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,800
What is our new landscape.

484
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,040
What is our, like now,

485
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,480
a hundred of different elements,

486
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,720
now, maybe 19 of them are just bad.

487
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,560
But what is the next weakest link.

488
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,200
And slowly take those out

489
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,680
of the equation, right?

490
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,360
Yes, it's a logical process.

491
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,680
And you need to deep dive into it.

492
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,360
And you need to ask yourself five whys,

493
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,600
and not one or two.

494
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,240
And make sure

495
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,640
that it's exactly what you do.

496
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,200
And not fixing the symptoms.

497
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,800
Right.

498
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,080
Why are you so excited

499
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,440
about the work that you're doing?

500
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,880
Why ProdOps?

501
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,400
Why helping teams with software?

502
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,200
Before we were talking about the impact

503
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,840
and the responsibility of an entrepreneur

504
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,040
for a better world.

505
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,280
So, why specifically

506
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,600
the industry that you're in

507
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,880
where you're helping companies

508
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,560
bring their idea to impact and fruition?

509
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,680
Obviously you could have gone

510
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,360
to a lot of different other paths.

511
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,440
Why did you choose this one?

512
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,080
I think because we helped much more ideas.

513
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,560
See the real world, really.

514
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,680
It's, what does it mean?

515
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
Go to production.

516
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,240
We know from our previous experience,

517
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,840
80% from your software goes to garbage.

518
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,800
Right? Right.

519
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,200
Because it's fun to see the day.

520
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,840
Daylight even.

521
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,720
And we help our customers really

522
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,240
to deliver their code to production.

523
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,920
It's not actually exciting

524
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,640
it's not the code in itself.

525
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,560
It's that we create, I think,

526
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,600
a business around it.

527
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,400
And serve people

528
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,640
and give them a better service.

529
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,200
I love it.

530
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,160
Okay, Viki, now, the hardest question,

531
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,680
which I did not give you enough time

532
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,320
to prepare for,

533
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,280
I need three words that you would use

534
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,200
to describe yourself,

535
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,720
or any of your clients would use

536
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,760
to describe yourself.

537
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,840
Who is Viki Slavin?

538
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,880
Okay. Someone trustful.

539
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,320
Okay. Why is it trustful?

540
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,680
I think, yes, people can trust me.

541
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,200
And I think I own this.

542
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,080
For 20 years that I'm in the business,

543
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,240
and different businesses that I did.

544
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,000
I think second,

545
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I have high intuition.

546
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,720
I make decision by it.

547
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,840
I think, and [--]

548
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,960
that you didn't give me time

549
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,080
to think about it,

550
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,560
I take ownership on things.

551
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,960
And that's how we started

552
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,560
the conversation.

553
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,560
And that's how we're ending it.

554
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,720
I mean, that's inspiring for me to hear.

555
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,520
I completely agree.

556
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,120
I mean, at the end, taking ownership

557
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,240
and responsibility,

558
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,840
I think is the number one key.

559
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,960
It's not just entrepreneurship.

560
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,200
It's anything that you do.

561
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,880
And I think it's also the essence

562
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,240
of being a trusted person. Right?

563
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,320
Having other people know

564
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
that you take ownership over your actions

565
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
and over your words.

566
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
I think that's really inspiring.

567
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,960
Viki, one piece of advice

568
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,480
that you would give

569
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,240
to a rising entrepreneur

570
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,360
that is just on their path

571
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,840
as they go along their journey now.

572
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,480
I think it creates a positive environment

573
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,640
where people work, learn,

574
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,960
or spend their time.

575
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,960
Create a good environment for people.

576
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,400
Because if not, what are they worth?

577
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,080
So, I think they need to create

578
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,600
a good culture in every companies

579
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,120
that they start and establish.

580
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,920
And the way they grow supposed to be.

581
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,320
And create good environment

582
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,960
for your people.

583
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,560
Not good conditions. Okay?

584
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,960
Not good, I think opportunities,

585
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,080
or good money.

586
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,240
Just good environment.

587
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,320
I love it.

588
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,920
Viki, thank you very very much.

589
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,760
Toda raba. Best of luck with ProdOps.

590
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,680
Thank you very much.

591
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,920
Have a lovely day.

592
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,840
Take care. Bye bye.
