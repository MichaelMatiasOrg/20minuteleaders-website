1
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,320
Shiran Elizur, thank you so much

2
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,040
for being on my show.

3
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,320
How are you?

4
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,880
I'm well. How are you?

5
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,480
Fantastic.

6
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,200
Thank you so much

7
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,000
for being so generous with your time.

8
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,840
And I know you have your daughters at home

9
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,000
and you're out of the office,

10
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,480
and I truly truly appreciate it.

11
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,640
I have so much to learn from you

12
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,240
with your experience

13
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,200
in all of different companies.

14
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,480
But most recently now in Super-Pharm,

15
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,960
running their brand development

16
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,760
and thinking of the next brands

17
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,400
that the customers want, right?

18
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,640
Right.

19
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,560
Incredible. Okay.

20
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,240
So, for those that are perhaps

21
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,200
in California, not in Tel Aviv right now,

22
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,800
Super-Pharm is one of Israel's

23
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,720
largest pharmacy chain.

24
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,840
It's like the regular CVS and Walgreens

25
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,120
that we have here,

26
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,840
where you go in

27
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
and you have both Super-Pharm items,

28
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,600
but you also have an abundance

29
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,720
of other brands in the store

30
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,120
that it's like a go-to place.

31
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,640
So, Shiran, before we dive

32
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,120
into Super-Pharm and your work there,

33
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,120
give me a little bit of background

34
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,960
into who you are and the journey

35
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,240
that you've gone through

36
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,880
to get to the world that you have today.

37
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,920
I actually stumbled upon it by chance.

38
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,720
I was living in New York

39
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,560
doing my masters at the new school,

40
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,280
and I was looking for an internship.

41
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,800
Which internships,

42
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,720
if it's not like Google or Microsoft,

43
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,000
they are not very big in Israel.

44
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,240
So when I went to the IDC,

45
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,760
I was just a waitress.

46
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,240
Work to make a living and to pay the rent.

47
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,120
But when I moved to New York,

48
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,440
it was obviously a great,

49
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,640
amazing opportunity

50
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,200
to be a part of great companies.

51
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,600
So, I actually was working

52
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,120
in the hospitality industry like events

53
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,280
and clubs, basically.

54
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,280
Someone who knew someone in Revlon

55
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,280
got me an interview.

56
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,120
I was accepted.

57
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,320
I was a master's student

58
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,400
along with lots of like college girls.

59
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,600
But still, it turned out quite okay

60
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,480
because I stayed there for a while after.

61
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,080
So, I was a part

62
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,960
of the product development team.

63
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,640
By the way, was that a turn off

64
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,200
or was that difficult to go into

65
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,240
a US based internship

66
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,160
where a lot of people there

67
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,080
are college students

68
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,560
that are much younger than you?

69
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,720
No, I didn't mind. So, first of all,

70
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,000
I was quite young. I mean, I was only 25.

71
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,960
It's not like I was like

72
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,000
in my 30s or something.

73
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,760
And I didn't really mind

74
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,800
because they were all a part

75
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,160
of the PR team and I was

76
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,520
in the product development team.

77
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,640
So, I have a different position

78
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,480
and different things to do.

79
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,360
Later then, I actually joined

80
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,640
this PR team as, just to work there

81
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,720
for a few months as well,

82
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,400
and then I move to another company.

83
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,160
So actually, I mean, I always love brands.

84
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,600
Also, food wise and in general,

85
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,360
I always found it interesting

86
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,600
also as a little girl.

87
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,480
What is a brand?

88
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,440
Give me your insight

89
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,280
into a two minute lecture.

90
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,320
What constitutes a brand

91
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,280
in the 21st century?

92
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,480
I feel like it's mostly an emotion.

93
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,280
Or something that

94
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,480
makes you feel something.

95
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,200
For me, not because I work there,

96
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,840
but Super-Pharm is the strongest brand

97
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,760
for me as being a woman.

98
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,120
Being in my 30s, being a mother.

99
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,600
And it was always a feeling for me,

100
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,480
even back when I was 16,

101
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,080
back when I was a soldier.

102
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,120
Because this retailer, this chain,

103
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,480
like their logo and everything,

104
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,600
walks with you through your life.

105
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,200
But I can also think of brands,

106
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,800
obviously like Glossier,

107
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,400
that make you feel special.

108
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,400
That are making you feel unique.

109
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,320
And they have to do

110
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,800
with how you feel about yourself,

111
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,280
how you position yourself.

112
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,840
So, I think they are,

113
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,000
first of all, emotions.

114
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,560
And second, they are tools

115
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,440
to identify and differentiate yourself

116
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,520
in society, among other people,

117
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,640
especially today.

118
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,040
Especially when talking to gen setters.

119
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,640
It's all about

120
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,080
how you differentiate yourself.

121
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,400
What does using or purchasing

122
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,000
or wearing the brand tells about you.

123
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,880
What does it say when you post

124
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,920
on your Instagram

125
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,560
that you shot something

126
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,080
or did you support your brand

127
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,440
or are you disappointed.

128
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,120
Right. Right.

129
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,960
So, It's mostly about self Identification,

130
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,640
differentiation for yourself

131
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,360
as the persona and emotion.

132
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,240
I love it. Okay.

133
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,880
So, let's transition now

134
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,280
to what you're doing today.

135
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,360
So, you have your experience at Revlon.

136
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,800
And you've also had experience

137
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,400
within a packaging company,

138
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,800
that distributes beauty products.

139
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,240
Right. They make package development

140
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,520
like they work with everyone,

141
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,920
with the entire L'Oreal group,

142
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
with Estee Lauder Group,

143
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,680
with Chanel, now she said with everyone.

144
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,400
And I learned a lot there

145
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,560
working with Mac and with Bobby Brown

146
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,960
and with all the big names.

147
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,000
Obviously, again,

148
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,320
I was a writer after school.

149
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,240
So I took whatever they gave me.

150
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,520
And it started with

151
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,640
running errands for everyone

152
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,960
and sitting in the messenger center

153
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,720
with everyone.

154
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,480
And I did it with much love

155
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,760
and dedication.

156
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,520
And it taught me a lot.

157
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,960
But then I decided, along with my husband,

158
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,240
to come back here to Israel

159
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,560
because we wanted to start a family.

160
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,640
In New York, obviously,

161
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,320
it's not even relevant money wise.

162
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,640
So, we came back here

163
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,960
and I worked for four years

164
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,800
in April cosmetics,

165
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,240
which is like a specialty beauty.

166
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,840
It's more like

167
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,000
on the selective higher end tier.

168
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,800
A bit more than two and a half years ago,

169
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,240
I moved to Super-Pharm,

170
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,200
which was like a dream come true for me.

171
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,320
Super-Pharm for me, it's for retail.

172
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,240
It's like it's Google. Really.

173
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,840
Yeah. Yeah.

174
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,880
So, just give me the context a little bit

175
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,280
into the Israeli ecosystem

176
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,240
and where is Super-Pharm

177
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,200
is located within that.

178
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,640
Because I think it's important

179
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,080
for the remainder of the conversation

180
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,680
to understand the incredible work

181
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,760
you're doing within Super-Pharm.

182
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,200
To understand how big Super-Pharm is

183
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,680
and how it integrates

184
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,280
into the lives of every Israeli.

185
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,640
But it's actually not just Israelis,

186
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,520
but it's also abroad.

187
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,640
Right.

188
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,800
First of all, Israel is a tiny country.

189
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,200
It's only nine million people.

190
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,480
And Super-Pharm has 260 doors.

191
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,400
So, it's literally everywhere.

192
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,280
It's a 10-minute drive

193
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,960
from every Israelis house, basically.

194
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,720
Every Israelis house.

195
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,280
Yeah, it's in the radius of everyone's,

196
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,240
it's in neighborhoods, in malls.

197
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,240
And it's everywhere.

198
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,520
It's the leading and larges

199
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,440
health and beauty retailer

200
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,480
here in Israel.

201
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,240
Its private label is huge.

202
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,080
And because we have those capabilities,

203
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,880
manufacturing, shipping,

204
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,240
logistic capabilities,

205
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,280
we decided two and a half years ago

206
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,760
to also operate as a distributor.

207
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,720
So, we also work directly with brands,

208
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,880
not manufacturers,

209
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,160
that create the life brand

210
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,000
for our private label, but retailer brands

211
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,160
that we negotiate with

212
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,720
and then decide to launch them directly

213
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,040
without a middleman.

214
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,760
Without a distributor in the middle.

215
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,280
We operate both as a retailer

216
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,680
and distributor for them.

217
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,960
And this is, we only we carry brands

218
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,680
that we feel and we know

219
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,280
that the Israeli customer is looking for.

220
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,520
Okay. Shiran, what is the Israeli customer

221
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,400
is looking for?

222
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,600
This sounds like such a difficult question

223
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,720
that you're sitting and you have to,

224
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,920
you're looking at a product

225
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,360
and you're saying,

226
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,680
"Hey, can I imagine a million people

227
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,280
buying this?"

228
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:15,880
"Yes or no?"

229
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,600
It sounds so,

230
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,120
I'm coming in as an engineer

231
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,520
from a very scientific background,

232
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,480
and I need everything

233
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,080
to be quantifiable in numbers.

234
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,040
But you can never quantify

235
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,880
something like this, right?

236
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,280
First of all, we, I mean,

237
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,280
Israeli customers, especially women,

238
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,360
are extremely online savvy.

239
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,520
So, we have this data.

240
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,440
We can look for it.

241
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,960
We know we have online competition.

242
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,960
We see which brands

243
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,360
they follow on Instagram.

244
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,000
We see which brands

245
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,760
they discuss on Facebook groups.

246
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,960
We ask questions.

247
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,480
We have our teams in 260 doors

248
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,560
telling us which brands

249
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,760
they're asking to purchase, to buy.

250
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,000
So, we have a decent clue.

251
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,920
But on the other hand,

252
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,600
we're looking for newness.

253
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,680
We're looking for innovation,

254
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,320
which is a bit, it's a different term

255
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,280
when we're talking about

256
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,560
skin care or beauty.

257
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,760
Because it's quite challenging

258
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,360
to create newness in these fields.

259
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:25,160
So, basically I would not launch a brand

260
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,520
that no one here knows.

261
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,760
Because I would not want

262
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,640
to waste time or money

263
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,840
on market education.

264
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,400
I rather have brands

265
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,920
that people already

266
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,560
purchase online from abroad,

267
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,360
or big names that everyone know.

268
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,560
And if it's a new brand,

269
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,480
I'd rather develop a brand myself.

270
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,880
If it's an unknown brand,

271
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,800
I'd rather create a brand of my own

272
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,520
like we did already

273
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,600
with three different ones.

274
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,120
And then you educate the market,

275
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,560
but you have a higher GP.

276
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,840
You have the ability

277
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,960
to control the materials

278
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,240
to create them from scratch.

279
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,280
So, I would say for your question,

280
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,080
we're looking for brands

281
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,280
that are very Instagram oriented, again,

282
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,280
because Instagram is a key factor

283
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,200
in my decision making process.

284
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,680
And we're looking for brands, obviously,

285
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,000
with good quality.

286
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,640
Not necessarily expensive.

287
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,800
Like the customers here

288
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,320
are very price savvy.

289
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,200
And for me, it's an agenda.

290
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,720
We only launch brands

291
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,200
that allow us to offer the products

292
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,480
for the same price as country of origin.

293
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,600
Like if I'm launching a UK brand,

294
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,120
price would be the same

295
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,840
if a customer would buy it

296
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,120
when she visits London.

297
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,800
Or if it's an American brand,

298
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,360
same thing.

299
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,320
And we always have competition.

300
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,960
Like I buy my beauty products on ASOS

301
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,120
and I have a discount code.

302
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,120
It's aisle 17,

303
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,520
to every Israeli girl here

304
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,320
knows it.

305
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,000
So, we always have competition.

306
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,720
And sometimes,

307
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,120
you can buy the products

308
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,400
for a lower price.

309
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,480
But still it's, I feel it's decent.

310
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,840
And we were being honest and decent

311
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,240
and we offer the goods in a good price.

312
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,200
So, it's both pricing and portfolio,

313
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,480
like choices that we need to make.

314
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,240
So, it sounds like

315
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,800
you have an awesome playground.

316
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,720
Because you have an idea for a new brand

317
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,680
that you want to develop,

318
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,040
you might get an idea

319
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,800
from some competition you say,

320
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,000
"Well, actually, I think I can do better."

321
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,840
"I can do it cheaper with better materials

322
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
and with my own branding."

323
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,920
And you mentioned that

324
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,880
you've already gone through this adventure

325
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,160
a few times.

326
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,120
And launching this brand to 260 doors.

327
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,160
First thing, you want to create

328
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,880
a new brand

329
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,800
and you want to test it

330
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,440
to the market,

331
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,560
Shiran, what do you do?

332
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,040
Like walk me through this lifecycle

333
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,640
of bringing this to fruition.

334
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,320
Because it sounds like

335
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,760
what you've got to play around with

336
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,480
sounds like successfully,

337
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,440
is something that a lot of people,

338
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,120
I love watching Shark Tank,

339
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,840
it sounds like that's what

340
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,000
every Shark Tank pitch person does, right?

341
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,160
Thinking of a brand,

342
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,920
and you get to think through it

343
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,280
with the team and launch it already

344
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,480
in 260 stores.

345
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,360
Yeah.

346
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,260
First of all, it's a lot of fun.

347
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,600
Skincare, beauty in general

348
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,520
it is a playground.

349
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,760
But I think you have to have

350
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,000
a professional background.

351
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,360
You know, my husband told me

352
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,400
when we were I think 24,

353
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,320
"Be a professional."

354
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,840
When we were deliberating,

355
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,400
should I take this internship.

356
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,440
He told me, I mean,

357
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,800
if you go for it, this is your path.

358
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,120
Become a professional

359
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,760
in the sense that

360
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,040
this is like the best tip he ever gave me.

361
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,720
And since then, I read all researchers.

362
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,720
I actually share it with people

363
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,960
in my workplace.

364
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,560
Like this is my turf,

365
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,680
beauty, industry, global, trends.

366
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,960
So, I think first of all,

367
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,800
you have to be a professional

368
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,400
at what you do.

369
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,920
Not everyone can create a beauty brand.

370
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,560
Second thing you do, for me anyway,

371
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,280
we were looking for the relevant trends

372
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,160
and we create a mood board.

373
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,040
Like we have our references,

374
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,160
we have tons of data, obviously,

375
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,680
in Super-Pharm.

376
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,440
So, we're looking for the brands

377
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,680
that tell the most.

378
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,040
The specific products

379
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,680
that we're looking for.

380
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,280
It's mostly like a business administration

381
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,560
It's things you learn in school.

382
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,880
But in general,

383
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,080
if I'm thinking marketing wise,

384
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,800
I'm creating a mood board.

385
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,200
I'm talking to a designer.

386
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,680
I choose the right assortment.

387
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,840
You have to be very accurate.

388
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,360
I never develop products

389
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,440
that we already have in our portfolio.

390
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,720
It's always newness.

391
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,240
And mostly, when we work on a brand

392
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,080
or when we choose a brand,

393
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,800
I mostly think about

394
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,040
how does the customer feel.

395
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,400
Like who is my customer

396
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,680
and how does she want to feel

397
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,600
when she purchases a product

398
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,000
of this brand.

399
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,880
How long does this process take

400
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,880
from this idea that you have

401
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,680
for a new cosmetic product,

402
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,200
to when I see it to 260 stores?

403
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,720
Today, you can do it

404
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,680
in four months, five months.

405
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:20,960
Sometimes, look, we have longer projects.

406
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,960
But I feel like this is a reality today.

407
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,760
If you look at influencers

408
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,520
and a lot of very small niche brands

409
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,640
that are being created from scratch now,

410
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,320
it's not like back then

411
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,160
when processes were way longer.

412
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,000
You can develop with a designer,

413
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,640
with a factory, on Instagram.

414
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,000
You can build the brand quite quickly.

415
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,280
There's registration and formulations.

416
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,000
But if you work with existing formulas

417
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,240
or you just upscale them a bit,

418
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,600
it doesn't take long.

419
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,240
This is the reality now.

420
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,120
People get famous in a second

421
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,560
and then they create their own brands

422
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
in a second.

423
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,440
And you go to sleep.

424
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,440
The next day you wake up,

425
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,120
you have three new brands.

426
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,960
Especially in the beauty industry.

427
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,360
So, we have to work fast

428
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,400
because we have competition.

429
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,400
Yeah, so.

430
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,120
So, what is the hardest thing

431
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,000
about this job?

432
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,560
So, is it the ideation phase?

433
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,120
Is it the competition, the analytics

434
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,560
and understanding what's happening?

435
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,800
I think choosing the right assortment.

436
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,480
Making sure the customers are happy.

437
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,120
And I think the most challenging thing

438
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,440
is to, well, obviously,

439
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,800
if you know what you are,

440
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,200
you can make a lot of money.

441
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,040
It's just knowing

442
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,280
what the customer is looking for.

443
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,640
For me working in Super-Pharm,

444
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,160
I mean, I'm a 33 year old mother of three,

445
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,960
so, I am the ideal Super-Pharm customer.

446
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,680
For personal care, for toiletries,

447
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,520
for diapers, for everything.

448
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
But for beauty,

449
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,880
there's a whole crowd out there

450
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,120
of 12, 16, 18 year olds.

451
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,960
I'm not them.

452
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,560
And I have to sell them

453
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,920
what you're looking for.

454
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,120
And sometimes they're half my age

455
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,240
or less, and I need to know

456
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,160
what they're looking for.

457
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,400
And this is a big challenge.

458
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,080
This is for me

459
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,240
is the most challenging thing.

460
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,920
Because you don't want to be pathetic.

461
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,520
You don't want to try and fail.

462
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,120
And I'm only 33. It's not like I'm 60.

463
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,920
Right?

464
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,600
But I see my, I have a daughter,

465
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,760
she's five and a half

466
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,240
and she is interested

467
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,560
in specific products.

468
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,360
She and her friends.

469
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,720
So, this maybe an easier age,

470
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,360
but a 16 year old which has money

471
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,360
and she is able to purchase

472
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,080
whatever she wants

473
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,960
and she's willing to spend money,

474
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,560
for me, it's quite challenging.

475
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,080
And I think it's relevant to all

476
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,720
I mean, not even not only the beauty

477
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,560
or toiletries in the streets,

478
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
in every industry,

479
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,000
also in fashion, also in general.

480
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,600
Exactly.

481
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,320
I'm coming to Stanford at 24.

482
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,240
And all of my classmates are using TikTok.

483
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,280
I have no idea what this platform is about

484
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,520
and why people would want

485
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,560
to look at 15 second videos.

486
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,600
I'm starting to get it,

487
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,720
but it's a different mentality.

488
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,320
But so, Shiran,

489
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,520
how do you compensate for that?

490
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,280
Because you have the responsibility

491
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,520
of selling to this demographic as well.

492
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,360
And you need to be an expert on it

493
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,480
just as much as you're an expert

494
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,520
on the 33 year old

495
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,680
young mothers in Israel.

496
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,840
So, how do you go and study

497
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,320
what do 16 year olds want

498
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,240
and what the 22 year olds want?

499
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,680
Well, Super-Pharm obviously,

500
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,200
we have a lot of researchers and group.

501
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,680
And we have agencies

502
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,720
that get money for it.

503
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:46,760
But I rather be ahead of trend.

504
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,400
The pathetic thing is coming in the end.

505
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,080
Because the research

506
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,200
is always in hindsight.

507
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,360
It's not necessarily forecasting, right?

508
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,800
Right. I'm not on Tiktok, obviously.

509
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,040
But I'm trying to identify trends

510
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,360
through style sites citing

511
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,480
and trend forecasting platforms

512
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,600
and through Instagram.

513
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,760
Instagram is like it's the strongest,

514
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,520
most important tool for me.

515
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,720
This is the key to everything.

516
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,160
I always think

517
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,320
if a brand is Instagramable,

518
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,440
now, we also think about it in Tiktok.

519
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,160
But we're trying to find additional ways.

520
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,960
We ask questions.

521
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,480
We notice, if it's an older crowd,

522
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,520
we can also use Facebook groups.

523
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,160
But for the challenging group

524
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:42,720
of  Gen Z, it's a problem.

525
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,040
I'm telling you the truth.

526
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,680
I have a brand. One of my brands

527
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,040
has a skin care, like a roller,

528
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,720
a rose quartz roller,

529
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,120
which is very big on Instagram.

530
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,000
Well, it was for the last two years.

531
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,400
I recently found out

532
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,000
girls that are ten and eleven

533
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,320
are purchasing this product.

534
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,120
They don't need it. Okay?

535
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,520
But it looks good on camera,

536
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,200
so they buy it.

537
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,000
Wow, that's fascinating.

538
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,720
What is one thing that you learned

539
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
about brands that you didn't know

540
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,000
before you joined the Super-Pharm?

541
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,520
What is the one insight you've gained

542
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,760
over the past few years that you look up?

543
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,400
I'm starting to understand

544
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,080
what this whole brand thing is about.

545
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:27,200
That you can create emotional connection

546
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,960
to a brand quite quickly

547
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,640
if you're accurate.

548
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:38,040
And that, well, globally, business wise,

549
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,360
I feel like big brands that I was raised on

550
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,640
and all women in globally,

551
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,800
all the women in the world,

552
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,760
that we always looked at Estee Lauder,

553
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,880
Clinique, Lancôme,

554
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,680
basically a lot of French brands.

555
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,960
France was like the empire of beauty.

556
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:04,080
They got this insulting title

557
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,760
of legacy brands.

558
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,480
And they are starting to look very uncool

559
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,680
to young ladies.

560
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,680
And I learned that

561
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,680
it doesn't really matter

562
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,640
how much money you have,

563
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,520
because, I mean,

564
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,680
you might lose it anyway.

565
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,960
So, it has to do

566
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,120
with making right choices.

567
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,160
Estee Lauder for example, two years ago

568
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,760
they started working with,

569
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,280
or maybe three years ago already,

570
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,680
they took Kendall Jenner

571
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,680
and put her in the front

572
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,800
in order to speak to Gen Z.

573
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,160
It didn't really help, I feel.

574
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,520
Because they use the same products

575
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,080
like a serum, that is nearly 500 shekels,

576
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,080
like $100 or something,

577
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,440
and got her to wear a red suit.

578
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,360
Like, who wears a red suit?

579
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,080
So, it's talking to older women again,

580
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,320
using a younger ambassador.

581
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,080
So, it doesn't really matter

582
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,080
how much money you have.

583
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,520
We have a small niche brands

584
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,840
that support, take and make them explode

585
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,760
because they're accurate and right.

586
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,480
They speak to the customers of tomorrow.

587
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,160
The customers that

588
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,080
they are looking for now.

589
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,800
They already have

590
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,800
the 50, 60 year old women buy there.

591
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,960
They don't necessarily have

592
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,920
the 16 year old's.

593
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,080
Right. Shiran, this was

594
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,520
incredibly insightful.

595
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,080
Thank you for your time and generosity.

596
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,400
And I know you have kids

597
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,000
in the other room.

598
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
So, really, thank you

599
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,840
for taking the time to do this.

600
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,440
I really appreciate it.

601
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,080
Before we leave, I need three words

602
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,440
that you would use to describe yourself.

603
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:45,560
I am impatient.

604
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,240
This is a hard one.

605
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,120
This is the hardest question of all.

606
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,440
Yeah. I don't really have patience.

607
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:59,280
I think, I listen.

608
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,240
Okay.

609
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,600
Yeah, I listen and pay attention

610
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,440
to comments.

611
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,840
That makes a lot of sense.

612
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:10,280
Yeah. And I multitask.

613
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,040
I'm a great believer

614
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
in done is better than perfect.

615
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,400
Since honestly not sounding like a cliche.

616
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,840
I read Leneen and I took this,

617
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,320
well, it's not her sentence, obviously,

618
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,400
but I took it and this is my way of life.

619
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:37,320
I'd rather finish most tasks in 90% way

620
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,040
instead of holding back on one specific.

621
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,040
I'm not a perfectionist,

622
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,720
let's just say that.

623
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,880
So, I think two very important tips are

624
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,520
finish what you started.

625
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,800
Even if it's not perfect,

626
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,880
just get it over with

627
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,320
and move to your next task.

628
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,080
And be a professional.

629
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,240
Choose one thing, dive in,

630
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,040
know what you're talking about,

631
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,880
become an expert and that's it.

632
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,000
Shiran, toda raba.

633
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,280
Thank you very very much.

634
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,280
And I can't wait to share this

635
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,840
with the world. Thank you.

636
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,400
Bye.
