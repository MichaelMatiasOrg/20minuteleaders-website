1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
The one thing I can say

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,120
about my journey that

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,240
I didn't plan for any of this.

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,880
In fact, I was quite resistant

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,250
at the beginning.

6
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,160
Arod Balissa, thank you so much

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,960
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,720
Thank you for having me.

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,200
It's wonderful to have you.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,560
And it's going to be wonderful

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,480
to talk about your different

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,040
entrepreneurial endeavors.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,400
A lot of them are social,

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,720
a lot of them are community.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,160
I think that if I look

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,920
at the different things

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,040
that you've done along your career,

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,200
perhaps besides the legal stuff,

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,080
we're looking at

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,280
a pretty comprehensive list of activities

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,440
that are very much involving

22
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,080
the community, particularly that of

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,360
the ecosystem in Israel.

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,920
So Arod, tell me a little bit

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,000
about your journey,

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,360
leading all the way up to being

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,320
to managing Deloitte Catalyst

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,400
in Israel for startups?

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,440
Well, you know, I guess the one thing

30
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,080
I can say about my journey that

31
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,200
I didn't plan for any of this.

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,840
in fact, I was quite resistant

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,720
at the beginning.

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,040
It started, I'd say Wize started about

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,080
10 years ago.

36
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,640
I think it was 2011.

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,360
And I was just out of the army

38
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,080
after three years at 8200.

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,240
And there was this thing,

40
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,520
the Facebook was just starting to share,

41
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,200
to let you tag people in things.

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,920
And I remember that

43
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,320
I was very bent on sharing things

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,920
with people like TED talks

45
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,880
and stuff like that.

46
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,520
And the thing wouldn't let me

47
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:15,600
tag more than six people.

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,920
So, I created the group

49
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,440
and hope that if we have

50
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,600
about 30, 40 people that I know

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,200
and would, you know,

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,600
would not block me or unfriend me.

53
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,960
And it kind of took a life of its own.

54
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,920
I'd say, it quickly grew to like

55
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,080
a 500, 700 people group

56
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,920
that was pretty active at the time.

57
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,320
And, you know, I'm not going to walk you

58
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,840
through the entire group history

59
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,120
because it doesn't really matter.

60
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,840
But it was on that venue that

61
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,800
a bunch of us have decided

62
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,240
to create an event for that community.

63
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,752
I think the idea was originally by

64
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:10,120
the shows friend, Guy Katsovich.

65
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:13,040
He came to us, he came to me

66
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,320
and few of the people and said,

67
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,680
"Hey, why don't we

68
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,960
have a community event?"

69
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,160
I thought it was a good idea.

70
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,040
You know, we did it.

71
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,920
It was quite successful.

72
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,400
And then I remember one time,

73
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,520
Guy paid me a visit and said,

74
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,000
"Hey, I've got this offer to you

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,600
to do this at the bar

76
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,560
let's say every once in two weeks."

77
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,800
And my immediate reaction was,

78
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,440
it was never going to work.

79
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,720
You know, I'm thankful

80
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,480
that he has beg to differ.

81
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,280
But you know,

82
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,676
the thing was that I wasn't really sure

83
00:03:51,677 --> 00:03:53,480
that would work

84
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,200
and that we should do it.

85
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,680
And 10 years later, I can tell you

86
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,120
that I am very happy that I was wrong.

87
00:04:02,121 --> 00:04:07,680
And I think, one of the things that

88
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,600
since then and actually even before that

89
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,360
I have characterize my approach is that,

90
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:22,400
I try to listen and let myself be wrong.

91
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,600
It's a hard thing to do.

92
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,440
And I know a lot of people, you know,

93
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,240
talk about failures and being wrong.

94
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,280
Here, it wasn't a failure.

95
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,160
I think, generally speaking,

96
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,000
it was a success.

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,720
But I was wrong.

98
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,800
I thought that there's no way

99
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,160
it would work and it kind of it did.

100
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,360
Not kind of.

101
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,600
I mean, Wize, over the years

102
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,160
has had hundreds of events

103
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,960
impacting thousands of people.

104
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,160
I mean, it's been a huge success,

105
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,000
to say the least.

106
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,040
Yeah. You know, I completely agree.

107
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,720
And it has transformed

108
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,600
into something that is

109
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,480
a critical part of my identity.

110
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,200
And I'd say that,

111
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,960
but I always whenever I'm asked about it,

112
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,840
I always start with the fact that

113
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,480
I was at the beginning,

114
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,360
I never thought it would work.

115
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,560
And I mean, to this day,

116
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,680
I'm really not sure why it still does

117
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,520
But I think I am, we are fortunate

118
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,240
that it still does

119
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,120
and that people in Israel

120
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,600
are very excited about the things we do

121
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,040
and about the events

122
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,000
and the content we bring.

123
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,720
But, you know, I guess

124
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
the first few years of Wize

125
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
kind of gave me the confidence

126
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,360
that I needed in order

127
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,080
to do more things or more endeavors.

128
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:54,560
And I think one of the things

129
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,440
that changed about me the most

130
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,000
is that I kind of realized that

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,800
if it won't work, it'll be fine.

132
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,760
I mean, you know,

133
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,720
the term we like to use in Israel

134
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,040
is fail fast, fail often.

135
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,760
And I think part of my,

136
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,120
one of my strategies was

137
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,360
or one of my strategies

138
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,320
till this very day is,

139
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,640
okay, I mean, fine, if it won't work,

140
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,120
it won't work.

141
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,230
We'll just, you know,

142
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,480
pick up the debris and move forward.

143
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,040
And I think it has been the

144
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,440
kind of like a cornerstone

145
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,720
of the way that I approach new things.

146
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,840
And it's not easy.

147
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,480
Emotionally, it's not easy for me.

148
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,120
And I think I'm a relatively

149
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,080
conservative person at nature.

150
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,800
And I keep trying to push myself

151
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
into new things because,

152
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,480
you know, because it has proved

153
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,920
that to be a generally good strategy.

154
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,360
Right. So, once we move past Wize.

155
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,560
You've implemented the same mindset

156
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,680
into all the different endeavors

157
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,160
that you've done.

158
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,040
So, talk to me a little bit about them.

159
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,360
And how did you bring

160
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,280
that mindset to develop these?

161
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,760
Again, I think,

162
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,320
so, we did learn a lot at Wize.

163
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,640
All of us.

164
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,080
All the people who were involved

165
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,600
and all the people

166
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,400
who are still involved,

167
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,520
we learned so much.

168
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,480
So much about, anything from operations

169
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,560
and making sure that things run on time,

170
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,000
and all the way up to leadership.

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,800
We incorporated a nonprofit,

172
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,985
I'd say in 2012 or something

173
00:07:51,986 --> 00:07:57,160
as a [--], an association.

174
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,360
And, you know, we

175
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:01,160
when you form an association,

176
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,520
you have to have a board of directors.

177
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,800
But really, when you are

178
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,760
a five to 10 people operation,

179
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,560
it really doesn't matter.

180
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,640
And especially when you are 22 or 23.

181
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,520
I didn't realize what it meant

182
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,800
to be a board member

183
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,120
and it didn't really mean anything

184
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
at the time.

185
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,160
But I think as we grew

186
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,760
and as I've spent more time doing,

187
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,880
you know, doing the work

188
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
in the first few years

189
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,960
and then kind of transitioning

190
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:41,280
to leading to managing individuals

191
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:45,280
and what is now teams,

192
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,760
you know, I think I've learned a lot

193
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,160
in terms of what does it mean to manage,

194
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,560
what does it mean to lead.

195
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,720
And in a way I think that we

196
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,040
kind of grew or at least

197
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,520
the people who are now on the board,

198
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,600
we kind of grew into the role.

199
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,040
And I think that today,

200
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:13,160
if I think about it,

201
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,000
the thing that was most impactful

202
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
is to know how to take a step back

203
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,680
and also bring other people in.

204
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,760
Trust the delegate effectively.

205
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,440
Work with them, in some cases

206
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,160
even mentor them

207
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,920
and really letting other people share

208
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,800
that thing that we've created

209
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,400
about 10 years ago.

210
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,000
Right. So, it's not just the community

211
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,040
that's the customer base

212
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,960
or the people that are using the product

213
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,960
or leveraging the association

214
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,920
and the non-profits work,

215
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,960
but it's also internally

216
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,720
the people that are running it.

217
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,360
And, of course, I'm assuming that

218
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,120
when you were discussing non-profits

219
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,440
and these sorts of associations,

220
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,920
you need the people there to,

221
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,040
first of all, be very in, right?

222
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,080
You need to really lube them in,

223
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,400
you need to really make it a community

224
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,080
primarily because

225
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,360
this is a non-profitable work.

226
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,920
And the motivations

227
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,040
for volunteering their time

228
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,840
at a non-profit work

229
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,880
are very, very different

230
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
than being a board member

231
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,120
of a for profit startup, perhaps. \Right?

232
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,040
100%.

233
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,160
I think that in a nonprofit,

234
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,640
you know, the internal motivations

235
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,600
are almost all you have.

236
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,880
I mean, in a for profit organization

237
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,880
or in a startup,

238
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,520
it's always a mix between

239
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,360
the money and the compensation

240
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,600
and the internal motivation,

241
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,520
which is very important.

242
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,200
If you want to have an A-team,

243
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,960
then you definitely need that.

244
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,200
It's just that in a nonprofit,

245
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,680
that's pretty much all you got.

246
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,040
And when you're already dealing

247
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,320
with volunteers, especially.

248
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,880
And I think that the key idea

249
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,360
is to help people find meaning

250
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,880
in their work.

251
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,400
And that's really not easy.

252
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,440
It's not easy for, you know,

253
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,040
it's not easy because

254
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,640
people have different agendas

255
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,640
and they have different

256
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,280
personality structures.

257
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,480
And people need, different people need

258
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,800
different levels of guidance

259
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,200
and different levels of support.

260
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,640
Some people are more independent

261
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,800
and they just want to go for it.

262
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,840
And some people need the guidance.

263
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,600
And I think that

264
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,080
that commitment is something

265
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,520
that can manifest itself

266
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,480
in different ways.

267
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,680
And it never stops.

268
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,560
Let me give you an example

269
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,200
from this day and age.

270
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,000
Corona hits

271
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,880
and, you know, we had to transition

272
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,720
from the bars environment

273
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,640
and the offline environment

274
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,200
to the online environment.

275
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,560
And, you know, as technical as it sounds,

276
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,960
it was also a profound change.

277
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,440
And one of the reasons it's such

278
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,800
a profound change is not because

279
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,080
well, it is because

280
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,920
people consume content online

281
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,880
in that in the bar,

282
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,360
but it really impacted our volunteers.

283
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,840
Because the DNA of our organization

284
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,160
was the physical interaction

285
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,960
with one another in bars.

286
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,680
And it was for our volunteers

287
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,960
and for our staff

288
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,160
as much as it was for our audience.

289
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,920
Now, it took us a while

290
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,200
to understand how

291
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,400
you know, how dramatic the change is

292
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,480
and we are still undergoing a process.

293
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,120
We are trying to redefine

294
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,840
what it means to volunteer at Wize.

295
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,280
Now, to be very honest,

296
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,760
and I think it is you know,

297
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,480
it is crucial to say that while

298
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,760
we as the organization's leadership

299
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,440
kind of had to step back

300
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,240
and think about

301
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,560
what we can do differently

302
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,960
and how we can redefine

303
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,080
the meaning of being

304
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,960
a volunteer at Wize,

305
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,640
it is, it was and it will be

306
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,000
a team effort.

307
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,640
And we need all of our volunteers

308
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,080
and all of our staff

309
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,800
to be committed to this.

310
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,120
And if they're not committed,

311
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,120
then maybe we're doing something wrong

312
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,360
And just to finish the thought, you know,

313
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,560
the key issue in all of this is that,

314
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,720
you know, you make mistakes

315
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,480
you test something in the field,

316
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,240
you make more mistakes,

317
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,520
you try to implement it,

318
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,760
and you basically try to be

319
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,720
honest and transparent enough about it

320
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,600
in order to be successful,

321
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,280
in order to transition well

322
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,720
from one environment to another.

323
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,920
100%.

324
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,760
The impact that Wize has had

325
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,960
is phenomenal.

326
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,120
But you've also taken part

327
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,880
in quite a few other activities

328
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,000
as a board member.

329
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,040
Particularly, both of the

330
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,520
Israel Internet Association,

331
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,080
but even more exciting for me,

332
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,000
the Alumni Association for 8200.

333
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,640
So, talk to me about your activity there

334
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,640
and what lessons have you brought

335
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,200
from Wize to this association

336
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,600
in your learnings?

337
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Well, so, I didn't start off

338
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,440
as a board member.

339
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,520
I started as a newsletter editor.

340
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,800
And I, you know, I volunteered there

341
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
and I spent a lot of time

342
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,524
doing that about,

343
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:02,760
I'd say two or three years.

344
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,320
And I think for this,

345
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,640
it was a very busy time

346
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,040
for me personally

347
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,520
with school and work

348
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,920
and a few other commitments in Wize.

349
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,320
And same thing,

350
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,560
I just decided to go for it

351
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,200
and see if it'll work.

352
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:27,760
And I just really enjoyed the journey.

353
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,280
And then at some point

354
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,920
where I entered the board of directors,

355
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,720
I'd say that

356
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,040
I did bring a lot of the things

357
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,360
I didn't do well at Wize.

358
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,160
All the things

359
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,000
that didn't really work well for me

360
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,440
or didn't really work well in general

361
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,600
and all of my missteps,

362
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,640
I just tried to learn back from them.

363
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,840
And the alumni association

364
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,000
is a much different organization.

365
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,040
And I love it dearly.

366
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,920
I'm still very much involved

367
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,160
and I keep on wanting

368
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,240
to be more and more involved.

369
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,560
I love the organization.

370
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,600
I think it's a phenomenal platform for,

371
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,400
to make an impact both on our members

372
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,000
and our alumni,

373
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,040
but also on the Israeli society.

374
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,120
And I think that the one of the things

375
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,360
that I kind of brought with me

376
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,200
is trying to learn

377
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,360
how to be a good board member,

378
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,400
which is a very tricky thing to do.

379
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:35,840
Because as a board member,

380
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,880
often times you have a

381
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,400
kind of like an internal struggle

382
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,320
between being you know,

383
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,360
you want to be there,

384
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,800
you want to get things done,

385
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,960
you want to be active,

386
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,160
but you have to remember

387
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,320
it's not your job.

388
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,869
Your job is,

389
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,840
as a board member, of course,

390
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,120
is to weigh in,

391
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,000
is to be strategic,

392
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,560
to be thoughtful, to help,

393
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,280
to offer help if you can,

394
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,160
and also be a part of the conversation.

395
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,560
I think, one of the things that,

396
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,000
you know, one of the things

397
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,240
that I carry on to this very day

398
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,000
is that, and this is something

399
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,240
that a friend told me,

400
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,400
I think originally came

401
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,080
from Stef Wertheimer

402
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,320
but I don't know him personally.

403
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,040
So, I can't attest.

404
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,920
But a board member does three things.

405
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,160
They appoint a CEO,

406
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,720
they fire a CEO,

407
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,360
and they ask, "How can I help?"

408
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,960
And I think the problem starts

409
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,920
when board members, in general

410
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,200
not necessarily in any organization,

411
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,000
but the problem is,

412
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,520
is where board members act as executives.

413
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,960
That's where usually

414
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,800
where the problem starts.

415
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,920
Now, we didn't have a CEO for a while,

416
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,720
for several years, but now we do.

417
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,480
We have for about

418
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,960
the last year and a half.

419
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,960
And I think that for me personally,

420
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,920
it kind of was an opportunity to test

421
00:18:14,921 --> 00:18:17,680
my ability to be

422
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,120
an effective board member

423
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,920
and to be there

424
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,880
for the CEO and to support

425
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,480
and not to, you know,

426
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,520
want to take charge.

427
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,560
Which is never a good thing.

428
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,920
Wow. That's fascinating.

429
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,880
So, what were some

430
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,760
of your responsibilities

431
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,400
or what was your experience

432
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,480
being a board member that

433
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,120
if you're looking across the board,

434
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,680
for these three organizations,

435
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,160
what key insight do you have

436
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,880
to potentially other board members

437
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,120
that of how they can really

438
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,840
be helpful and non-clashing?

439
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,640
Because this is a topic

440
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,520
that has come

441
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,200
time and time again on this show

442
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,560
of what it means to be a supportive

443
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,600
and helpful board member

444
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,680
versus one that may be

445
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,200
clashing or disruptive to the process.

446
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,520
So, I'd love to hear

447
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,720
one or two key insights

448
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,000
from your experience.

449
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,800
That's an excellent question.

450
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,320
There's a couple of things.

451
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:25,640
One is, the role of the board

452
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,120
in my mind, is to provide strategic,

453
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:38,520
strategic guidance to the executives.

454
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:44,480
It is, and I think that, you know

455
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,240
a board can be too involved

456
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,920
and it could also be too detached

457
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,520
and both things aren't great.

458
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,480
It really takes, it takes a very, very

459
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,240
you know, it takes being very minded

460
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,040
and very thoughtful

461
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,560
in order to create the balance

462
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,000
between being too involved

463
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,120
and too detached.

464
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,320
Right.

465
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,400
I think that there's a conception,

466
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,280
there's a and just I don't know,

467
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,062
a thought there's a conception that

468
00:20:19,063 --> 00:20:20,079
a board needs to do

469
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,760
their work full time.

470
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,160
And maybe in a Fortune 500 company,

471
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,440
they have to be,

472
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,000
you know, doing their job like

473
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,160
as full time gig, maybe. I don't know.

474
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,640
I've never been

475
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,320
in the Fortune 500 board.

476
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,720
But I think that from my experience,

477
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
the key issue is

478
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,960
to work with your executives

479
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,320
to strike the right balance.

480
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,600
There's no one answer.

481
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,040
It really depends on what

482
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,920
your executives need.

483
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,280
So, that's one feat.

484
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,520
Striking the right balance between

485
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,320
being too much involved

486
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,560
and not being involved at all.

487
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,400
The second thing is,

488
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,560
as a board member,

489
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,720
not necessarily as a board,

490
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,800
but as a board member,

491
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,120
and this is going to sound very cliche,

492
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,320
but I still think

493
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,800
it's incredibly important.

494
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,760
It's crafting a good

495
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,960
and helpful relationship with the CEO

496
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,080
and with his leadership team.

497
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,000
And the key to crafting

498
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,760
a good relationship

499
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,160
is to show that you're there,

500
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,920
you're active, you're interested,

501
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,320
you're willing to put in the time,

502
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,960
but you're not there

503
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,480
to step on their toes.

504
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,840
At a certain time, you have to be able

505
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,720
to take a step back

506
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,920
and say, "I've said my piece.

507
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,240
I'm not going to get too involved."

508
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,520
And you know, I've done this.

509
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,760
I was wrong about this many times.

510
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,000
I have over kind of stepped

511
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,800
my boundaries as a board member.

512
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,480
I have been too involved

513
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,400
and sometimes I've been too detached.

514
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,120
And to be very honest,

515
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,760
I'm still trying to figure out

516
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,880
what's the correct word, sorry,

517
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,840
what's the correct balance

518
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,560
for each board that I'm in.

519
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,320
And the last thing the last insight,

520
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,120
if you want to call it,

521
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,800
is different boards

522
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,440
have different dynamics.

523
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,600
And to be an effective board member,

524
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,920
you have to be able

525
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,360
to read those dynamics

526
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,880
and take and kind of choose what role

527
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,640
you want to play.

528
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,120
Now, a good friend once told me

529
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,880
that a person needs to know

530
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,280
when they are in charge

531
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,440
and when they are followers.

532
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,400
In the way he said

533
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,280
it was just typical to Israel,

534
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,080
A person needs to know

535
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,760
when he's a commander or a soldier.

536
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,251
Yeah.

537
00:23:03,252 --> 00:23:06,400
And I think it's incredibly important.

538
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,120
Especially for,

539
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,360
it's actually easier for people

540
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,080
who sit on several boards.

541
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,840
But the idea is that, you know,

542
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,160
different boards have different dynamics

543
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,080
and they tend to have

544
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,280
different levels of conversation.

545
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,080
And I think that

546
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,000
you want to decide how active

547
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,680
and in what ways you can be

548
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,360
and what is your role

549
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,480
on that board.

550
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,880
I'll give one example.

551
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,480
In my role in the group dynamic

552
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,320
in the Internet Association

553
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,720
is profoundly different than what it is

554
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,760
in the alumni association,

555
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,240
in the sense that

556
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,800
there are things, for example,

557
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:01,000
in the organization's activities that I,

558
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,480
I don't have a lot of input.

559
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,720
For example, there's a lot of

560
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,800
technical issues that have to do with,

561
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,520
how do we make sure

562
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,600
that the nation's servers

563
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,680
are kept afloat.

564
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,240
Honestly, nothing.

565
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,800
I have nothing to say about this.

566
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,080
That makes a lot of sense.

567
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,480
And Arod, I really want to thank you

568
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,920
for shining light for me

569
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,040
and for everybody else that's listening

570
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,520
about the responsibilities

571
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,680
of a board member.

572
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,800
And more importantly, the positive ways

573
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,920
to make a positive impact on a board.

574
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,880
And I think that it's

575
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,600
I'm excited to take part

576
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,240
in these activities myself one day.

577
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,600
And then I'm definitely going to take

578
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
a lot of these lessons to heart.

579
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,760
So, thank you for being generous

580
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,320
with your time

581
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,680
and sharing that with me.

582
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,600
And before we go Arod,

583
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,400
I'd love to ask you

584
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,720
the most important question,

585
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,120
which is three words that you would use

586
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,960
to describe yourself.

587
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,360
Wow. I'd say optimistic,

588
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,920
conservative, and thoughtful.

589
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,860
I love that.

590
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:08,400
And I think that it's going by,

591
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,160
by what we discussed today

592
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,400
about your different responsibilities,

593
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,360
that's exactly what you're exerting.

594
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,090
So, thank you

595
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:15,720
for the inspiration for that.

596
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,280
And stay safe and stay healthy.

597
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,440
And best of luck with all these

598
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,320
amazing, amazing communities.

599
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,400
Thank you for having me.

600
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,600
And as everybody says,

601
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,920
it's all about the people.

602
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,000
So, thanks everybody.

603
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,960
Thank you for having me.

604
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,160
And thanks everybody

605
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,720
for being a part of the ride.
