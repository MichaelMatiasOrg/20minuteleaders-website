1 Anat, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Happy to be here. Thanks for having me. This is so so great. We met. I can't believe it was like five years ago. I think what I said on the on like a teenage entrepreneur sort of the table and pitch this idea. Which is actually about dietary restrictions, Which is, We're gonna have a great time talking about your new startup. Way too many things to even give about your bio, but just as a quick introduction. You know, founder of the Meet Program which will I'd love to know more about. Investment partner at the Innovation Endeavors. One of the most remarkable venture capital funds in the world. And we both know Dror. And I get so much inspiration from just saying the strategy that all of you have built out and the investments you've made over there. And now, you went back to being a founder which many would say, Typically not your typical route. Anat, you know, let's just start from the back. Meet. It is such a unique program and with so much impact that we have to give it first. Sure. I have to say actually, I'm so happy also starting it. Because you can’t ignore what’s going on outside today. So, for me, as you know me. We both come from a place where conflict and kind of ethnic strike has been a part of our life, and history and every moment. And Meet definitely originated in our effort to solve it. So, just to say what is. You know, it's a non-profit that we started in 2004. I started it with my brother and one of our best friends in [--] Palestinian women. And the idea was really to solve this Israeli-Palestine conflict. Or have an impact on it. By creating a network of future leaders. And we do it by bringing excelling youth on both sides to a really rigorous three-year program. And an alumni program where they get taught by an instructors from MIT and Google and Facebook and many many other companies. And they learn computer science and entrepreneurship and leadership. And kind of really build initiatives together. And the goal is for them to become political, social changemakers in their community. To really change the status quo. Incredible. So, you actually looking at this conflict and saying, "Yeah, so there's a lot of things are happening on the top level of decision makers. But actually, why don't we take a more bottom-up approach and let's target those that are going to be the next leaders. And maybe if we can spark some curiosity and some liberal thinking and open mindedness early on, we can see great things happening. Yeah. And I think you know, I can't think about what's going on in our world right now. It's really about the human connection of humanity. It's being able to understand that even when someone is totally different from you, in perceptions. That we all have commonalities and identities. And can we connect around those places first? And if you think about experience, probably at Stanford, you know definitely my experience. It's one of the things that hooked us and led us to start Meet. It's the networks in our lives that change the way we look at the world. Write those com, like the glasses You see the world, so if you suddenly met, I call the newspaper to ask. You know one of my best friends in my masters was from Chile. I never read an article before I met her about Chile. But suddenly I became really curious about the lack of knowledge. So, this is very much simplifying the idea. Can it solve the Israeli-Palestine conflict? Through that you can start to find and create a commonalities and break down the barriers and the need to also focusing on the young leaders. Thinking that the impact model is really putting people later on in powerful positions who understand the benefits of working together. And actually have the active network. Right? Because it's those networks, they don’t only change how you see the world, but they are your tools for making an impact. Right? It’s like, when you see a problem, the first thing you think about is, "Who do I know that knows, that can help me solve this problem?" When Israelis and Palestinians never get to interact. Do not know each other. They don't help each other. And you know, in each other they don't exist in each other’s professional and social networks. And we're really breaking that. I've lost you? There. I got it. There, we can edit this. And Ahab says. And it speaks so truly to me. You know, coming in to Stanford. I did grow up on the line between Palo Alto and Tel Aviv. But honestly it was the same type of people. And you know what I don't really get to introduce to the whole world And all of the sudden my best friend here on road trip with me. Santiago was from Mexico. And he invites to be with him and his family in their house. And I'm seeing this whole new culture. This amazing culture that it doesn’t matter how much I would have read. I wouldn’t have been able to really empathize with. And then, the room mate who lives in front of me in the dorm is from Uganda. And he got a laptop when he was younger and he self-taught himself how to program. And he got to Stanford. And he's talking about these atrocities that are happening. And hearing it from the primary source. And one of my goals is now to go and visit him and live with his family in Uganda. Because of what you're saying that this human connection and being there. Not just reading about it as a second hand source. But being there is remarkable. Anat, skipping away to Innovation Endeavors. Because we only have 20 minutes. It's impossible. I know. I know. I should have done in the big issue. Why couldn’t have I called it a 30-minute leaders? I don’t know why. Innovation Endeavors. Tell me a little bit about that and what you did over there. Yeah. So, first of all Innovation Endeavors is like a greate firm. It's one of the most incredible venture capital firms who are up to date. Was originally started as a fund that was solely backed by Eric Schmidt from Google and he's founding partner is Dror Berman. He's a very good friend of mine. An amazing guy. And the fund has grown significantly. There’s' a lot of other investors today. And really, it is an example of how you can use capital to target big massive problems. Massive problems. So, actually innovation never asses. We only tackle massive problems. Are you moving the needle? If not, maybe we're not the right partner for you. That's right. Massive problems that honestly have a positive impact on the world. So, not to confuse this with social impact but really looking at the places where you can leverage technology to really shift the game. And either old markets or merging markets. There are ways that contribute to solving significant things in the world. And for me you know, it was an incredible journey to be able to be a part of that. So you know, break this down for me a little bit more. Because you know, as an entrepreneur and as somebody who gets excited so much about this world, it gets confusing sometimes. It gets confusing because a lot of people love to say that they're gonna make an impact. Some of them means social impact. Some of them global impact. Financial impact. What are the differences? And how has Innovation Endeavors placed itself as the nucleus of changing the world? Look, I mean you can measure impact in many different ways. By the way, even if you're trying to look at the visual impact, to look at the human scale. How many human lives have we impact. If you look at economic job creation or economic impact. If you look at solutions to health problems like disease, and environment and so on. And I think for a venture capital firm like Innovation Endeavors, you look for that intersection where this is not about a double bottom line or trip off. But it is about an intersection where deep tech insignificantly shift away things are done. In a way they also generates returns. But that can really create solutions and create a better world. You know, the question of how you think about that? It really depends. At the end of the day. That's the innovation side of it. What? Yeah. That's the innovation side of it. Yes. And what you believe are models for change. You know I've talked over the years on myself. I've transitioned from non-profit public sector. Worked in the public sector. Worked in VC. I'm now an entrepreneur. You know, there are very different models of impact. But I think it’s the choice. You make choices about what are the problems you're trying to solve? Who are the people you are trying to influence? What kind of teams you built and cultures you built? And all of that is part of what you can think about is impact. Did I lose you again? And so, at the end the question yield itself. You can’t be an expert on everything. You're a small team. Innovation Endeavors is a small team. And when you're dealing with this, with the most difficult problems in the world to solve, you kind of need to be an expert on them to solve them. So how do you even go about being a partner in this? A capital partner. But also you know sitting on the Boards of these companies, or even just understanding whether this is a viable business that could actually reach that impact. Yeah, I mean again. Although and I have to say you know I'm no longer a partner. I'm now on the other side but I can speak from the experience when I was there. And I'm also super lucky. Because Innovation Endeavors invested in my companies. On my boards I get to stay very Yes. I Can't wait to go about it. Yeah Yes and I love it so much. But just kind of my perspective. When I was more on the VC side. It's part of what I love was this challenge. that every minute of the day you're learning a new space. At the same time there's definitely verticals on the start to build pieceses around and you understand and kind of deep dive in to. In addition, it's really about building networks again of experts around you. Whether its founders or other people that you can learn from quickly. It's learning how do you understand the things as quickly as possible and are able to target the main risk and have the pieces about whether this risk can be kind of de-risk by this team. This team and this company has the right team to de-risk of the opportunities big enough. I would say through this experience over time as a VC. You know, VC as I like to say is a mix of an art and a science. There's something to it. You know each person develops their intuitive and instinct. Some of it gets a little bit on the bias side. But at the same time, you also develop certain approaches as frameworks. Questions that really asses those things pretty analytically. I love it. That's just incredible. And Anat, I hope I'll have this enough time for this. But now you're actually maybe one of the most exciting course of the journey being on the entrepreneur side. Co-founding a company, not just another company but a needle moving company. That Innovation Endeavors, and of Khosla ventures, and Marc Benioff, Benioff is also a part of. Please, what is Ukko? What is that name actually? Everyone ask. So Ukko, it's actually Ukko. it's the Finnish from Finland. It's the God of harvesting rains of the Finnish mythology. And we wanted a name that is not overly bio. It's connected to what we do. [-]. And also had some kind of personal connection. I grow up going to Finland in the summers. I have a really close relationship with that country. So, Ukko were an early stage bio-tech company. With focus on solving food allergy and sensitivities. So, things like gluten sensitivities, and also peanut allergy, and other food allergies. An allergy? Really? You just say that you're working to solve food allergies like gluten sensitivities and peanuts sensitivity? That's right. I mean, these are like that's huge. Like you know, some people say, "I wanna sell more ads. I want to have people to download my app on the app store. You're solving food things that are killing people around the world. That's right. And I have to say, you know for me going back to Innovation Endeavors's definitely you know something that's super close to my heart. I don't think I would have ever left unless it was for something like this. And as I said, it's from above. Yes. So, food allergy. I don’t remember this growing up. And I grow up like I'm an in-between person. I grow up in Israel and in the US. I don’t remember having allergies around me. Right. People did not even really talk about them even. And its just wasn’t as prevalent. So, the data’s astounding. There’s you know like a 50% rising pits with food allergies in the past decade alone. We work with the best best doctors literally in the world. And I also tell you that it's not clear why this is happening. There are certain explanations but none of them are, there isn’t one resounding scientifically back that explanation. So, yes, we are targeting, we basically design proteins that are totally safe but maintain all the other qualities and we applied them in the food world and the therapeutics world. So, both creating new types of foods and also drugs. So, what is the vision for this? You're saying you're literally creating this different source of proteins that are gonna be used in creating foods that we consume. So that's somebody who now couldn’t eat a cake because of their gluten sensitivity, they'll be able to eat that same cake because the protein structures different? Yeah. What's your favorite bakery there in Israel that you miss the most? Or like in San Francisco California? I'm a simple guy. I go for like Arcaffe for lunch there. Okay. So, let's go Tartine in San Francisco, okay. So, imagine doing off to walk into Tartine in San Francisco and being able to eat anything that you want there. It would be safe anymore. 'Cause it's really awkward when you have sensitivity. So today for people with sensitivity is really the only thing you can do is to avoid the food by eating gluten free. Gluten free is that not very tasty. Actually, the main issues that often very unhealthy because you have to add a lot of substitutes to compensate for the fact that there is no gluten. So, yes. For example, with gluten, our gluten proteins are completely safe by maintaining all the other qualities. So, you have that amazing breads, pastas, pizza doughs that anyone in the world could eat. Would be safe for everyone. And on food allergy side. We're actually developing a drug. That would be a potential cure. Wow. Okay so the completely yet intertwined things. Both of them world changing. And at the end, I guess the biggest challenge of it would be to make this economically viable. So, that the producing gluten free pasta that is just as tasty as the same. I'm not even talking about the challenges of getting an FDA approval for a cure and that's sort of thing. So, is this really the biggest challenge? Or what are you finding now as you're going through this entrepreneurship path? I mean, entrepreneurship path has so many challenges. You know, like that question like what keeps you up at night? On most regular nights. Not during pandemics and you know really simply rested. It's so concerning and saddening. But I would say, you know definitely making sure that we have a good go to market. We are a bio tech company. Biology is a tough partner in the route. Because you can’t control it sometimes as much as, It's not like if you hack all night or code all night you can get it out. And kind of you know launch and iterate. Often it takes time. Experiments take time and so on. So, for us making sure that we, the minute that our product gets out there. It's truly safe and wonderful. And it provides a solution for these communities that’s critical. We're actually producing our gluten through other crops. Sort of end up being cause the value price, you know, competitive. That's just incredible. Anat, give me a few insights on this path that you are going on as an entrepreneur. It's really the things that do keep you up at night. And I mean, your mother you have different responsibilities. You did a VC job. You know a lot of people are comparing it that you're having a lot of the fund that an entrepreneur might have. But you still get to do your nine to five job and go have dinner with the kids every day and all. Well maybe not. Innovations and all But now you're committed to this you know seven to nine-year journey at least of running this company. And how was this decision? And how did it actually work out? First of all, it’s hard. 'Cause I left something I loved. And again lucky to have maintain to have them also in my life. But I'm also an operator. There's a big difference in your daily experiences. We see as you make experience and kind of the daily experience on the operating side. I love the operation. I especially love the zero to something. Those are my favorite things to kind of get involve in. So you know, it’s very different as far as you definitely in the IT versus in VC are you go wide. Right? Like as I have said, every two hours you may deal with few different company. You get a really macro view of the world. Whereas for me now I'm deep deep diving into our world. So that's one difference. And you know you have to, the multitasking is a mess. At MIT where I went you know there’s a, they said that freshman years is like drinking from a fire hose. So, I think especially being CEO, it’s like drinking from I don’t know, 50 firehose that’s going on at once. Every minute of the day I'm really trying to figure out. Am I prioritizing the right things? Is this really what I should be working on because it’s all the time I cannot get everything done? And when you add on to that small kids, that uprise only become you know that struggle only becomes more difficult or bigger challenge. Amazing. Anat, I can’t believe our time is almost over. But I have two more questions. First of all, this is a very selfish question. Because I now have you giving me attention. And I'm on my own entrepreneurship path. From the idea to the amazing unit that I really enjoyed being. And to now at Stanford and I'm exploring these different paths from venture capital to technology to entrepreneurship. And I imagine that there’s a lot of like many people that are going through these similar dilemmas of where do we prioritize. And you know, careers are no longer linear. And I take so much inspiration from the path that you chose and from a lot of your friends that shows. And what would be your best recommendation or recommendations you would give to somebody like me whose really just starting out their path and has much much to learn and many ways to go? Yeah. I would say personally I think I'm not definitely an example of connecting the dots. I'm still connecting it. You know, my backgrounds very very inter disciplinarian. Really went from one place to another. And I think one of things I learn, a few things I've learned, one is don't stay in your head too long. There's a limit to how much you can print. A lot happens by doing. You discover a lot of new things about your passions. About what you really connect to. What you care about. Like getting out there and starting to do things. You can't plan the path. It's never gonna be the way you planned it exactly. Sometimes you have to jump and go and just keeps thinking how it leads you forward. People tend to, especially when they're in school, to kind of really try to figure out, consult with a million people and you get locked in sometimes. And sometimes you just have to take the risk and move forward. And know that you're not just taking one path. It will divert along the way to other things as well. Totally. Okay. And very very last I have warned about this ahead of time. But still, I want to know one, two maybe three words that you would consider yourself as or maybe your kids would consider you as. Or if I would ask Dror, or your co-founder at Ukko, who is Anat? What drives you? What are the key things that keeps you up? I don’t if it’s the key thing that keeps me up. But I'd say, yeah. When you told me you may ask this, the reason is at first, I would say I'm still figuring that out. I realized at some point in my life that. That's the best answer I ever got. Anat. You know, one time ago I kept looking for definitions. And as you realize I don’t want that. It's a dynamic question. So, I don’t have one answer. I can also say that I realize that I'm really in between. I'm an in between person in so many things. I'm Israeli but I'm also American. You know I'm an entrepreneur. My mom. And that's actually a strength. It's also a struggle because you have to balance and figure out a few little came of uncertainty and your identity in someone. But I don’t know. Hopefully back at zero, a little bit of what you wanted. I love it. Anat, toda raba. Thank you so much. Best of luck. And just keep inspiring me in other words. Please. Thanks. Take care. All right. Bye.
