1
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,320
Rom Eliaz, thank you so much

2
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,640
for taking the time to be on the show.

3
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,200
Sure, my pleasure.

4
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,400
Thank you, Michael,

5
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,320
for hosting me.

6
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,440
Really, I just want to mention, Rom,

7
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,640
before we start that we had a session

8
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,480
a few hours ago

9
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,400
that we were about to start.

10
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,200
And you are coming out

11
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,920
of the hospital with a mask.

12
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,520
And you were telling me

13
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,360
that you're working

14
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,840
on some different studies

15
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,920
in regards to covid.

16
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,720
And I just got so much inspiration

17
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,960
from that, and I was so happy

18
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,120
that we're delaying talk,

19
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,240
because you're doing such important work

20
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,440
in biomedical.

21
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,480
So, first of all, thank you

22
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,920
for all the amazing work

23
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,640
that you're doing.

24
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,600
And now, please, yes,

25
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,160
tell me a little bit about yourself.

26
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,800
Sure, I will be more than happy to.

27
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,760
So, basically,

28
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,400
I was born and raised in Israel.

29
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,360
And basically,

30
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,200
one of the four big cities in Israel.

31
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,000
But is actually,

32
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,960
the what's called Be'er Sheva,

33
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,160
which is basically,

34
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,090
the "queen" of the desert.

35
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,280
Or the "capital" of the desert in Israel.

36
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,640
There are four main cities.

37
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,320
And Be'er Sheva is the

38
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,600
less appreciating one.

39
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,240
The north there is  Haifa, Tel Aviv,

40
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,040
Jerusalem and Be'er Sheva.

41
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,680
[--],

42
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,310
Haifa in the north.

43
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,760
There's Tel Aviv, Jerusalem,

44
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,800
and  then, Be'er Sheva in the south.

45
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,880
But it's David Ben-Gurion's

46
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,680
favorite city.

47
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,080
So, that's what counts.

48
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,870
That's true.

49
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,040
[--]

50
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,880
And, he went to [--].

51
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,400
Long story short, I learned

52
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,120
chemical engineering and biotechnology

53
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,560
in Ben-Gurion University,

54
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
and Weizmann Institute.

55
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,040
I did my bachelor degree,

56
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,720
and then my PhD in both university.

57
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,720
While I was in my PhD, I came across

58
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,800
a few patents that we developed.

59
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,200
And then, I told that we would like to

60
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,320
maybe start a new startup company

61
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,840
around our patents.

62
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,840
So, I decided that I want to be

63
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,360
an executive and maybe the CEO

64
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,440
of the company.

65
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,240
So, I decided that I need to learn MBA.

66
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,920
So, I went to an MBA program.

67
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,160
That was the most important

68
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,600
because an MBA get started with

69
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,800
the professors from a Harvard University

70
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,160
and Boston University in Israel.

71
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,640
During my last year of my PhD,

72
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,880
which was my second year of my MBA,

73
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,680
my professor in Ben-Gurion decided to go

74
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,320
and start a company in MIT

75
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,280
with Bob Langer, it's a huge name

76
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,440
in the field of drug delivery

77
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,120
and making other devices.

78
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,720
So, I wrote a letter

79
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,680
to the dean of Harvard and saying,

80
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,000
Give you the true Boston program,

81
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I would like to do

82
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,680
my second year in Boston

83
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,360
while I'm actually writing my PhD in MIT.

84
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,280
And that's what happened.

85
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,080
I moved to Harvard for a year.

86
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,560
I wrote my PhD during the day in MIT.

87
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,840
And I went to school, I mean,

88
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,120
Harvard Business School.

89
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,120
And that's where my first experience

90
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,880
with the US.

91
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,160
And then, graduated.

92
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,600
And went to do my postdoc,

93
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,960
in UCSF, in University of California,

94
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,640
San Francisco.

95
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,000
Once I was there, I learned,

96
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,520
I actually enjoyed myself

97
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,760
in a basketball game.

98
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,120
And long story short,

99
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,360
I was in bed on my second week

100
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,840
of my postdoc,

101
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,000
in bed for six weeks,

102
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,760
basically cannot move anywhere.

103
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,550
What did you do?

104
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,360
You're playing basketball.

105
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,480
How do you go to bed for six weeks?

106
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,920
Oh, because I got my ACL torn apart,

107
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,680
my meniscus tear.

108
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,480
I went to play basketball,

109
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,000
and then, I was injured,

110
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,240
and then, I needed to have surgery.

111
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,480
And while I was waiting for the surgery,

112
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,120
I'm getting full recovery,

113
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,000
I basically wrote a grant for the NIH.

114
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I got a five million dollar grant.

115
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,320
We wrote a few pointers in cancer research

116
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,200
about the grant.

117
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,040
I then make a grant from the cancer,

118
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,000
tobacco research in the UCSF.

119
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,080
And from [--],

120
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,720
I award a scholarship.

121
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,320
So, it was another one.

122
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,120
And then, actually I won

123
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,440
five million dollars grant,

124
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,560
which was a lot of money then.

125
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,480
It's a lot of money now too.

126
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,680
Yeah. I wrote a few papers

127
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,120
in cancer research, and a year later,

128
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,920
I got an assistant professor in UCSF.

129
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,200
So, I was an assistant professor

130
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,280
in UCSF and UC Berkeley

131
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,800
for the gene therapy, drug delivery,

132
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,540
and biomedical engineering.

133
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,520
And then, living in the Silicon Valley,

134
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,000
you basically see all these entrepreneurs.

135
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,280
And I take my MBA, and I knew

136
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,720
that what I really want to do

137
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,880
is to start my own company

138
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,520
and really help humanity

139
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,800
with some new invention

140
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,400
and new things that we did.

141
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,040
So, I was lucky enough

142
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,520
to actually have a few patents

143
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,960
in my PhD thesis.

144
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,560
But also, in my postdoc.

145
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,440
So, I was working on tissue engineering.

146
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,080
And then, work with some medical devices

147
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,840
and try [--].

148
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,440
So, we wrote a few more patents.

149
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,360
We wrote a few for more papers.

150
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,040
We're trying to start a new company.

151
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,200
But, I then was asked,

152
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,120
after actually giving a lecture in London,

153
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,600
to join a company called ALZA.

154
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,880
ALZA was a company in Silicon Valley

155
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,160
started by Alejandro Zaffaroni.

156
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,040
And that time, it was 3000 people.

157
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,720
I joined.

158
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,400
They actually asked me to join

159
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,040
around 1999.

160
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,320
That was the Y2K.

161
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,440
Long story short,

162
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,680
I joined them a year later.

163
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,520
Actually a year and a half later in 2001.

164
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,760
And then, the company was acquired

165
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,000
half a year later

166
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,320
by  Johnson & Johnson.

167
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,080
So, in my first exit,

168
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,160
I basically was lucky.

169
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,920
I was in the right place

170
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,040
at the right time.

171
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,360
And once ALZA was acquired

172
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,840
for $12.3 billion,

173
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,320
all the management went to start

174
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,760
Jazz Pharmaceutical.

175
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,800
So, I was lucky enough to be on the side

176
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,680
to basically go to the management

177
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,800
of the whole portfolio of drug delivering

178
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,880
of Johnson & Johnson and ALZA.

179
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,050
Yeah. I was in Johnson & Johnson

180
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,360
for about three years.

181
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,520
One thing I want to say before I continue,

182
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,640
if someone tell you

183
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,280
that luck is not important,

184
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,160
it is important.

185
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,560
And a better luck is always better

186
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,400
than any other thing

187
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,160
that you are doing.

188
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,080
Rom, I think, you can definitely say

189
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,520
that luck is important, but at the end,

190
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,120
up until this point where you're seeing

191
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,240
that luck is important,

192
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,280
you've already managed to do your PhD

193
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,560
on biotech.

194
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,560
You've already done your MBA

195
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
through Harvard.

196
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,360
So, let's just say that, yes,

197
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,240
luck may be important,

198
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,960
but in your case,

199
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,840
I think your record speaks for yourself

200
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,760
in terms of your profession and ability.

201
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,440
I think that if you are working hard

202
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,960
and you're trying to go

203
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,920
to the right places,

204
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,160
the luck will go with you.

205
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,960
So, at the end of the day,

206
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,120
if you are really doing what you need,

207
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,680
and even if you fail,

208
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,200
eventually, things will go with you.

209
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,000
Anyway, I was at ALZA.

210
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,640
I was there for about four years.

211
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,360
After four years, they wanted me to move

212
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,520
to New Brunswick in the East Coast.

213
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,520
I didn't want to move.

214
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,520
So, I actually join a small company.

215
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,440
I was employee number five

216
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,520
in a small company called [--].

217
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,920
A company that was started in Palo Alto.

218
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,880
I was doing,

219
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,200
was basically was a spinoff

220
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,400
from Genentech,

221
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,800
when Genentech wanted to go

222
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,040
only to Oncology to spill out

223
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,740
all the neurodegenerative diseases.

224
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,560
Arnon Rosenthal was the head

225
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,860
of neurodegenerative diseases

226
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,320
at Genentech, started this company

227
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,760
called Rinat Neuroscience.

228
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,560
Today, all you guys living in West Coast

229
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,800
know there is a building of Pfizer

230
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,080
called Rinat, in South San Francisco.

231
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,600
That was where the original Rinat was.

232
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,440
Rinat was acquired by Pfizer

233
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,880
two and a half years later

234
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,600
for like $500 million.

235
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,040
And we have one antibody for Alzheimer.

236
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,120
We have one antibody for pain.

237
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,680
And we have one antibody for migraine,

238
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,600
which called the anti CGRP.

239
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,360
All of these,

240
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,000
except of the Alzheimer,

241
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,240
are basically drugs.

242
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,000
One is a drug by Pfizer for pain.

243
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,560
The other one

244
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,912
is a drug by Teva for migraine.

245
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:08,000
Rom, I have to stop you here.

246
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,050
Because I have to understand,

247
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,080
what is the commonality between

248
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,360
all these things that you've worked on?

249
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,840
I mean, it sounds like all of them

250
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,160
are very very meaningful.

251
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,400
They improve the lives of many.

252
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,720
They're very challenging professionally

253
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,000
because you're actually inventing

254
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,640
new drugs.

255
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,280
You're inventing new treatments

256
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,120
for a lot of these.

257
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,440
I mean, just as when

258
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,400
you were an assistant professor,

259
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,600
you co-authored over 40 publications.

260
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,440
Where does this curiosity come from

261
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,480
and this motivation to build businesses,

262
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,960
or to help run businesses,

263
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,320
while at the same time

264
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,200
helping millions of people

265
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,040
around the world with your inventions?

266
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,440
I think it's coming from youth.

267
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
So, you know what you're going to do.

268
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,680
I was, I have a cleft palate.

269
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,520
I was a child that was dealing

270
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,680
with doctors all my life

271
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,080
because I was treated by them.

272
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,200
I was fascinated by this medical field.

273
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,600
I wanted to be a doctor.

274
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,400
In Israel,  you have to go to the army.

275
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,160
I couldn't go through the army to,

276
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,440
I wanted to be a doctor.

277
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,800
The army wanted me to go

278
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,120
and learn physics and computers.

279
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,840
I said, "I don't want to."

280
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,080
They actually gave me

281
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,680
my own program at the time.

282
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,180
It was a patent called Talpiot

283
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,440
I didn't want to go there.

284
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,920
They gave me a special one.

285
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,440
But at the end of the day, I think,

286
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,120
it's really coming from where,

287
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,000
I felt that all my life, I really wanted

288
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,560
to help society and to help people.

289
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,000
I really wanted to be a doctor

290
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,840
all my life, or, a violin player.

291
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,360
Then, when I was like 17 years old,

292
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,200
I actually attempted to Juilliard.

293
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,015
But I decided that I'm not going to.

294
00:19:56,015 --> 00:20:00,440
Okay. Rom, rega. One is rega. Hold on.

295
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,720
I have to breathe. one second.

296
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,480
First of all, my brother wanted,

297
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,360
Yeah. That's exactly

298
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,320
what I'm feeling right now.

299
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,720
My brother went to Juilliard.

300
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,760
And so, it's very close to heart.

301
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,560
I just want to recap.

302
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,320
The Army wants you to go to Talpiot,

303
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,720
you're probably the first person

304
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,840
in the history of the nation of Israel,

305
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,200
that declines that offer

306
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,080
so that they give you your own program.

307
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,560
You get accepted to Juilliard, which,

308
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,240
and everybody knows this is like

309
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,320
the most prestigious school

310
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,240
in the world, for music.

311
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,320
I saw my brother, with blood,

312
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,760
sweat and tears, all his life

313
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,200
until he got accepted there

314
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,120
and had a phenomenal experience

315
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,720
in the university.

316
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,120
You don't go to Juilliard, right?

317
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,920
Because you're not a violinist now.

318
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,040
You're a venture capital in Biomed.

319
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,430
So, you forgo Juilliard.

320
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,960
I'm still playing the violin.

321
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,720
And I still have my own 2Cds.

322
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,680
And I'm still playing today.

323
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,960
I'm playing with friends.

324
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,280
So, that's the beauty about music.

325
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,760
And violin,  in general,

326
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,520
you always can do it as a hobby.

327
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,880
You don't have to do it as a profession.

328
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,960
So, you don't go to Juilliard,

329
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,480
but you continue.

330
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,080
And, I can't believe, I'm already sad

331
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,440
that we only have a few minutes left.

332
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,840
But Rom, I have to get

333
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,200
your perspective today.

334
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,400
You're in venture capital.

335
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,040
You're investing as a part

336
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,760
of so many different funds,

337
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,040
one of them J-Ventures,

338
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,400
which we're both a part of.

339
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,320
But, I mean, what is it about

340
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,040
this biomedical field

341
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,200
that really intrigues you?

342
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,280
And where are we headed now?

343
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,800
So, I mean, as a young entrepreneur,

344
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,640
I want to learn, what are

345
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,400
the most exciting things in the field,

346
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,920
and where can I put my time and effort

347
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,760
into helping others?

348
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,040
I think, that one of the most

349
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,320
important thing in general,

350
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,040
not only in a medicine and medical,

351
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,440
but anything in life, is that,

352
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,540
if you attack a problem

353
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,320
you need to attack it

354
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,880
from different angles.

355
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,760
And that's exactly where medical field

356
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,840
is going now.

357
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,120
If you think about collaboration now,

358
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,480
between the high tech and the biotech,

359
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,890
you can see that basically now,

360
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,920
with all the AI, and machine learning,

361
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,800
and all the digital health,

362
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,040
you can basically get so many data.

363
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,960
I'm able to collect in the past

364
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,680
in a big data, and basically analyze it

365
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,640
not only from the perspective

366
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,360
of only biology,

367
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,480
or how long you're looking

368
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,320
into antibodies or drugs,

369
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,640
but then, you also can see

370
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,920
how they affect.

371
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,720
Basically, it's a combination

372
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,960
of bioinformatic,

373
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,200
that was known in the past.

374
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,520
Now, with the big data,

375
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,560
and took it to gain the collaboration

376
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,330
between all these fields.

377
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,480
Like the neural cells, and the big data,

378
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,970
the AI, the machine learning.

379
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,140
All the data and knowledge that we have,

380
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,080
from the medical field,

381
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,560
this is where the world is going.

382
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,960
It's still going to be,

383
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,800
at the end of the day, you still will need

384
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,280
to go back to the old biology

385
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,960
and find the new targets,

386
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,600
and the new therapies for every drug.

387
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,400
But the way there,

388
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,640
might be much much shorter.

389
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,520
You can be much more accurate.

390
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
And basically, the world is going towards

391
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
personalized medicine.

392
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,640
So, there's not going to be

393
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,880
any more capsules, or pills,

394
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,640
or anything that you are taking is going,

395
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,760
and not even antibody,  that are good for,

396
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,560
let's say, about 25% or 2% of the society.

397
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,480
Each person is going to have

398
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,760
a gene editing or gene analysis.

399
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,040
And by knowing that,

400
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,280
and knowing exactly what are

401
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,200
the expression of genes

402
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,760
and receptors that you have,

403
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,440
you would know exactly how to target.

404
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,640
And eventually, I'm thinking

405
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,840
that it's going to be a collaboration

406
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,120
of MEMS of nano particles.

407
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,960
You know, the great Isaac Asimov,

408
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,960
which he wrote on the voyage,

409
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,000
the wonderful voyage.

410
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,180
I forgot the name of the book.

411
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,660
Basically, when you have

412
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,680
a little submarine,

413
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:12,480
that's going into the vein,

414
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,360
and can actually go through your body

415
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,600
and really see what are the problem

416
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,760
and solve it, that's something

417
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,920
where the field is going.

418
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,640
Everything's going to be targeted.

419
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,440
It's going to be collaboration with me,

420
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,600
between engineering, biology,

421
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,560
and basically hi-tech.

422
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,480
Rom, I think this is just inspiring.

423
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,640
What made you do the transition

424
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,560
from an entrepreneur

425
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,520
and tech executive to venture capital?

426
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,920
And how much time are you spending

427
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,360
on either aspects

428
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,400
of your professional career now?

429
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,440
Are you mostly focusing on one of them?

430
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,700
Or, is it always a balance

431
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,040
in between the two?

432
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,480
I think, it's always a balance.

433
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,880
And, it's so important to understand,

434
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,690
when you are investing

435
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,760
in this biotech field,

436
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,240
you really need to understand

437
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:57,960
what is the field.

438
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,840
You need to understand,

439
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,680
how time things are taking.

440
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,720
At the end of the day, it's always people,

441
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,520
and it's always technologies.

442
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,200
And again, people people people.

443
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,380
But, you need to understand

444
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,480
this technology here,

445
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,400
because you need to know

446
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,080
how to make the right investment.

447
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,490
And then, at the end of the day,

448
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,760
you're investing in peoples.

449
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,920
And you need people that know

450
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,640
how to solve a situation.

451
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,600
That can solve a difficult situation.

452
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,160
How to solve a crisis.

453
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,040
Because everything in startup,

454
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,500
you can see a great business plan.

455
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,560
But, at the end of the day,

456
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,200
nothing is close to the business plan.

457
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,160
It's going completely to a different way.

458
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,800
That's why, the people,

459
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
is the most important thing in everything.

460
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,240
And, at the end of the day,

461
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,840
if you have good people,

462
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,840
and you have the right collection of people

463
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,920
from different fields,

464
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,400
you always will be able to do

465
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,350
all these stuff.

466
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:50,040
But, I'm also assuming that

467
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,040
that in the companies that you invest

468
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,080
in the medical space,

469
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,800
they're not the average,

470
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,960
Silicon Valley company.

471
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,360
That's another social media app,

472
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,840
or another consumer product.

473
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,000
This is more long term research

474
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,120
that the research is the business, right?

475
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,560
The IP of the company and the knowledge,

476
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,960
I mean, if it either works

477
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,320
and then it's hugely successful,

478
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,720
or, it doesn't work and then it dies down.

479
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,880
Is that the right comparison?

480
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,160
I mean, we are always looking

481
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,640
for the cutting edge technology.

482
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,080
Always for the next thing,

483
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,000
for something that is unknown.

484
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,360
For something that is the next thing,

485
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,920
because this is the field.

486
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,760
If you want to invest and you can do that.

487
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,880
You can be a generic,

488
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,520
you can be made to,

489
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,960
you can be a lot of things.

490
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,400
But if you want to be an entrepreneur,

491
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,160
and you really want to take a risk,

492
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,240
you really need to invest

493
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,680
in a cutting edge technology

494
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,600
and taking a risk in life.

495
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,160
You need to know that sometimes

496
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,800
you're taking your own cab,

497
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,320
or you're taking gamble

498
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,360
on the wrong application.

499
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,880
But then, at the end of the day,

500
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,240
if you are looking on a variety

501
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,320
and a nice portfolio of situations,

502
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,080
at the end of the day,

503
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,920
you probably, hopefully, will be able

504
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,080
to target it all.

505
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,040
To be the winner of at least one or two.

506
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,320
You need only one Google.

507
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,840
And you need only one Facebook.

508
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,520
You need only one [--].

509
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,500
At the end of the day,

510
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,320
if you are even to get this one,

511
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,360
then you will have enough funds

512
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,050
to actually invest in other

513
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,720
[--] and cutting edge.

514
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,560
At the end of the day, you never know.

515
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,380
Even a failure technology,

516
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,680
at the end of the day can become merge

517
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
to another technology.

518
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,600
And it happened.

519
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,520
It happened that we went

520
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,760
from one technology, it didn't work.

521
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,600
But when we merge it with others,

522
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
at the end of the day,

523
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,240
maybe even five years later,

524
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,640
or maybe even 10 years later,

525
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,560
because the market wasn't ready.

526
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,920
Or, the technology wasn't there yet.

527
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,880
It's still, the dreams can become true.

528
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,760
OK, so the question for myself,

529
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,840
I'm an engineer.

530
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,680
I'm studying artificial intelligence

531
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,640
at university now.

532
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,040
But I definitely want to see myself

533
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,080
being an active part into the space

534
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,800
that you're in right now,

535
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,480
because, I mean,

536
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,200
that's where the future is.

537
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,120
And this is what is actually

538
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,200
going to either save,

539
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,800
or at least magnify and help

540
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,320
the lives of millions of people,

541
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,360
if not billions of people

542
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,240
around the world.

543
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,200
If I want to be an entrepreneur

544
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,360
in your space, and I have the expertise

545
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,400
in computer science and machine learning,

546
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,200
do I also need to go and pursue academics

547
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,000
in biology or biotech?

548
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,280
Or, is it enough that I find

549
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,480
the right partners who can complement

550
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,200
my knowledge with their knowledge

551
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,560
and go that?

552
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,200
So, this is a serious question

553
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,120
that I'm wondering

554
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,950
what's the right path for me?

555
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:47,840
No. You don't need to be all of them.

556
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,880
For my perspective,

557
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,800
I always like to know a lot of things.

558
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,740
So, you don't need to have

559
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,720
a degree in biology, or something.

560
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,840
You definitely need to work

561
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,600
with the right people.

562
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,000
But, if you ask me,

563
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,960
I will definitely recommend

564
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,680
that you would take some advanced classes,

565
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,520
or, you will take some classes

566
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,160
or something in the field.

567
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,320
You will always try

568
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,640
to learn more and more.

569
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,840
It's a never ending process like Fortgame.

570
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,040
I have a degree

571
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,520
black belt in martial arts.

572
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,720
And basically, what I'm saying,

573
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,360
never ending excellence.

574
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,240
You never can stay in your comfort zone.

575
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,480
Always you need to get

576
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,000
to improve yourself,

577
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,360
to get better, to know better.

578
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,520
I wasn't trying to overachieving this,

579
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,400
and really trying to go

580
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,600
out of your comfort zone.

581
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,060
And all the time,

582
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,340
learn and learn and learn.

583
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,040
Eventually, you will get to drag

584
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,960
people around you.

585
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,380
You will find the right people.

586
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,000
But again,  you need to know

587
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,560
one thing really really well.

588
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,600
And if you are really good

589
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,880
in your AI and machine learning,

590
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,610
excel in it. Be an expert in it.

591
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:03,320
So, be a point of excellence

592
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,400
from AI in your team.

593
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,480
But, definitely try to surround yourself

594
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,520
with a team of people

595
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,880
coming from the biotech,

596
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,660
Especially if you want to go into biotech,

597
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,680
people that know how to do business.

598
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,080
And then, once you decide

599
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,720
to do something in the field,

600
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,440
definitely try and learn about it.

601
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,160
You don't need to be expert.

602
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,120
You don't need to be the best person

603
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,440
in the room, in the field.

604
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,840
But definitely try to understand

605
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
what they are talking about.

606
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,360
So, you know what's going on

607
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:32,880
around you.

608
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,600
Rom, I am so inspired by this talk.

609
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,880
Thank you again for giving me your time.

610
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,600
Right before we leave, I need three words

611
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,560
that you would use to describe yourself.

612
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:47,140
Definitely, Motivation.

613
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,910
Never ending improvement.

614
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,000
What is this big one?

615
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,680
Never ending improvement.

616
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,960
Never ending improvement.

617
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,440
And, Never stop to dream.

618
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,520
Always dream.

619
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,120
And once dream a dream,

620
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,640
try to achieve it and make it coming true.

621
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,680
Wow. Rom, thank you for saving lives.

622
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,920
Thank you for making the world better.

623
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,400
That's all I have to say.

624
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,520
And I'm definitely going to keep you

625
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,440
in the loop.

626
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,080
And I'm thankful for this friendship

627
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,760
and relationship.

628
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,080
And I'm going to come back

629
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,440
for more and more advice over the years.

630
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,120
So, thank you.

631
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,110
Will be more than happy to.

632
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,120
Thank you, Michael.

633
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,800
Thank you. Take care. Bye bye.

634
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,240
Bye bye.
