00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,920
Earle Hall, thank you so much

2
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,640
for being on my show.

3
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,480
How are you?

4
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,800
Good, and how about you?

5
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,200
I am doing just fine.

6
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,920
Where are you talking from right now?

7
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,800
I am in the beautiful city

8
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
of Las Vegas, Nevada USA.

9
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,880
Las Vegas, Nevada.

10
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,440
And what are you doing

11
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,000
in Las Vegas, Nevada?

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,160
I'm building

13
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,960
an artificial intelligence company.

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,560
We've been at it

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,120
for almost 10 years right now.

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,640
We pick up data out of slot machines

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,040
from about 50 countries right now.

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,440
And our goal with that data

19
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,120
is to bring forward algorithms

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,400
for anti-money laundering

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,760
to cure responsible gaming.

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,960
And with covid,

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,280
we're doing a lot of things

24
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,160
in the cashless world.

25
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,800
So, we've been at this for a long while.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,520
We're not really a startup.

27
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,920
So Earl, this is a fascinating industry,

28
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,200
and it's particularly fascinating to me

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,360
because I know nothing about it.

30
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,120
So, aside from the fact that I enjoy

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,000
the occasional trip with friends,

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,680
and I myself am more of a poker guy,

33
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,200
but first I have to go back a little bit.

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,720
And you have a long history

35
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,480
with technology,

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,320
not just AXES.ai

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,320
but all the way

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,880
I'd love to go back to your growing up.

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
And you just mentioned

40
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,480
you had a pretty fascinating take

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,320
on your interaction with computers.

42
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,320
Talk to me a little bit about that.

43
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,880
Well, I grew up in a very small place.

44
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,600
It's a little tiny island right out

45
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,120
in the North Atlantic in Canada

46
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,360
called Newfoundland,

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,680
or Newfoundland as we call it at home.

48
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,880
Like Come From Away, from the musical.

49
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,600
Yes, but exactly that.

50
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,760
Not far from where I was born, actually.

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,760
And the issue was,

52
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,640
one, I was very blessed that even though

53
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,240
we were in a small place,

54
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,600
relatively modest place,

55
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,000
we did have computers in school

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,400
back in the early 1980s.

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,360
Wow.

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,400
But what freaked me out is that

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,800
outside of the mathematics

60
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,360
of making a sign curve,

61
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,760
the actual result

62
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,080
of a computer back then

63
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,280
was pretty stupid.

64
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,600
There was no difference between

65
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,520
the real world and the virtual world.

66
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,960
And that's really what I didn't like

67
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,480
as I graduated through computers,

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,320
went into the army.

69
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,680
And then, just to talk about the army,

70
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,840
then I saw the intelligence

71
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,880
that we were using back then

72
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,560
to keep a tank's muzzle

73
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,000
pointed towards the target.

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,480
And that's where my heart

75
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,360
started to beat this,

76
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,360
and if you can keep the muzzle straight

77
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,680
while the vehicle is moving,

78
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,160
then I started looking at how artillery

79
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,760
was projecting, getting into precision,

80
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,160
and then my heart started to beat

81
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,120
for artificial intelligence.

82
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,840
Wow.

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,400
Then I said okay-

84
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Wait.

85
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,360
Yeah, go ahead sorry.

86
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,280
Already back then, you were thinking about

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,640
artificial intelligence?

88
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,960
We've come up with all these buzzwords now

89
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,840
that are okay, but the thing is,

90
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,400
for me, it's predictability.

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,520
If you look at the human psyche,

92
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,560
we have two things that keep us out

93
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,280
of the present moment:

94
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,360
we have fear of reproducing the past

95
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,880
or regret from the past,

96
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,800
or we have things from the past

97
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,200
giving us fear

98
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,360
that are predicting negative things

99
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,080
of the future.

100
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,520
And that's really the way

101
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,400
the animal brain works.

102
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,320
That's the way

103
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,360
we get all polluted with cortisol

104
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,320
and things inside of our brain.

105
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,360
So for me back then

106
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,320
I didn't have the word

107
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,760
artificial intelligence

108
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,000
until really the movie Matrix

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,880
that I worked on with my team

110
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,760
in special effects for movies.

111
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,280
But for me, the word was predictability.

112
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,960
How are they predicting

113
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,160
keeping that straight

114
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,000
with everything that's going on?

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And that's when mathematics

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,840
really started to make my heart beat.

117
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,720
So, mathematics make your heartbeat.

118
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,880
Give me a couple sentences

119
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,680
about MIT, Matrix,

120
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,640
what's that all about?

121
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,840
Well, I was working in a company,

122
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,840
I was building a company that was doing

123
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,840
some very advanced scanning

124
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,880
of human bodies

125
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,000
to be able to move them

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,640
into the virtual world,

127
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,840
and then morph them onto wire frames

128
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,320
so we could do animation.

129
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,960
And when I actually understood

130
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,680
what the movie The Matrix

131
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,000
was trying to project as an

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,520
artificial intelligence world saying,

133
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,160
"Warning, Red Flag."

134
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,080
I went, "Oh my God. Okay, good.

135
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,480
Now, I get it."

136
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,720
And at the same time,

137
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,240
I was recruited to teach

138
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,320
at the master's degree level

139
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,160
in management of information.

140
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,440
So, I'll be honest,

141
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,760
now that it's a long time ago,

142
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,200
I used to use my students as guinea pigs

143
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,360
to do all kinds of papers

144
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,480
on things that were edge back then.

145
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,360
Wow.

146
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,880
To try to get food into my brain,

147
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,840
to understand where the world was going.

148
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,920
Predictability.

149
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
So, how do you end up

150
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
in the gaming industry?

151
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,640
You're now talking to me from Las Vegas.

152
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,520
And I'd love to, in a second, dive into

153
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,040
what is the gaming industry,

154
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,800
what is anti-money laundering,

155
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,040
and what is the role of AI

156
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,000
within the gaming industry.

157
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,600
But before that,

158
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,040
how do you make that transition?

159
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,040
I was in a totally different world.

160
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,880
I was actually in a totally

161
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,400
different part of the world.

162
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,160
And I got approached by

163
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,000
one of the large accounting firms

164
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,400
that a company in the gaming space

165
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,120
was going bankrupt

166
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,240
because of the fact that

167
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,320
they had a lot of patents,

168
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,560
a lot of potential,

169
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,000
but they ran out of cash

170
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,080
and they needed to be restructured.

171
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,520
So, I was parachuted in

172
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,560
to restructure that.

173
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,320
And I'll be honest,

174
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,600
I had never been in a casino

175
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,400
in my entire life.

176
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,520
Wow. Up to that point, of course.

177
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,680
Picked up the company, fixed it,

178
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,200
it ended up getting sold.

179
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,280
And towards the end before it got sold,

180
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,080
I got asked

181
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,160
by a very prestigious shareholder

182
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,520
that's one of my mentors,

183
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,760
"Please come help me build this company

184
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,040
that I have here."

185
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,560
And when I saw what he was doing

186
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,360
I was completely in trouble

187
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,760
because it was the intersection

188
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,880
of all of my dreams.

189
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,120
Big data,

190
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,920
wouldn't be able to do it

191
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,880
without blockchain,

192
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,760
and it was 100% taking me

193
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,280
in the direction where I wanted to go

194
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,120
of building an app store

195
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,680
to be able to welcome any app

196
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,520
in the planet onto the big data.

197
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,320
And all of that was fueling my vision

198
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,360
to get towards AI.

199
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,640
So, my mentor actually

200
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,480
rolled out a red carpet for me

201
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,520
to live my tech dream.

202
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,450
Wow. That's just incredible.

203
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,800
Okay. So, you're now finding yourself

204
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,160
in Las Vegas in the gaming space.

205
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,480
Give me a little bit of context,

206
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,560
because I know very little

207
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,240
about the gaming space,

208
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
let alone Las Vegas.

209
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,760
And I'm sure that

210
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,040
a lot of my friends also,

211
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,040
while we may enjoy it

212
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,680
from time to time,

213
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,960
we don't really understand

214
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,440
this ecosystem of what's happening there.

215
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,480
So, give me a little bit of background.

216
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,960
Well, we're kind of a stranger

217
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,080
to the entire industry,

218
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,720
because the industry was brought up

219
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,680
on slot machines and table games.

220
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,800
And data was largely localized

221
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,040
inside of all of the casinos.

222
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
Back in the old days

223
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,600
it was because of trust issues,

224
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,200
and today, it's largely

225
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,160
because of technology issues.

226
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,920
So, we showed up out of the blue

227
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,680
with a vision that was very much

228
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,240
years ahead of everybody else by saying,

229
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,480
We've got to get all of the data out

230
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,920
and get it into the cloud

231
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,080
so that we can manage performance,

232
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,000
we can manage KYC,

233
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,520
we can manage regulatory issues.

234
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,840
But at the same time,

235
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,760
our job is to bring in things

236
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,560
that can cure and advance the industry.

237
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
So, what does that mean

238
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,800
cure and advance?

239
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,120
So, cured of what?

240
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,720
And what does it mean

241
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,120
to advance the gaming industry?

242
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,640
Well, there are a lot of places

243
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,360
around the world

244
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,200
that still have legitimacy issues

245
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,560
with gaming where there's two things:

246
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,360
either it's a safe haven for crime,

247
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,280
or it's a potential area

248
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,600
where addiction can infiltrate in.

249
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,840
So, most people don't see that gaming

250
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,280
can bring in those things,

251
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,040
but I can tell you,

252
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,040
I travelled almost 100 countries

253
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,200
for this project I'm building,

254
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,040
and you see a lot of crazy stuff

255
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,120
around the world.

256
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,560
A lot.

257
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,840
A hundred countries?

258
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,600
Yeah. And you see a lot of crazy stuff.

259
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,360
Yup. Well over 100,

260
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,600
but I round it down to 100.

261
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,920
So, the thing is is that

262
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,760
what's driving our passion is that

263
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,000
we can actually bring in

264
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
a little bit of light

265
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,440
into some dark spaces.

266
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,920
Like when you hook in our system

267
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
into a jurisdiction,

268
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,880
into a place, into a casino,

269
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,800
the money laundering

270
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,920
... a lot of trouble

271
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,400
because we trace every single click,

272
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,280
every single movement,

273
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,920
every single change.

274
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,200
And our algorithms

275
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,000
are monitoring anything

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,120
that's outside of the normal.

277
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,640
So, if somebody is in there

278
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,480
trying to launder money,

279
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,240
we pick  them up in a heartbeat.

280
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,400
Wow. So, what have you seen

281
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,000
happen around the world

282
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,040
as you're putting in these technologies?

283
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,720
Give me a little bit

284
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,000
of the insight over there.

285
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,680
Well one of the things, I guess,

286
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,560
is like any consumer based industry,

287
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,880
like if you read any of the stuff

288
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,080
that Wal-Mart's been putting out

289
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,680
over the years

290
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,120
that the greatest threat to theft

291
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,200
in a Wal-Mart

292
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,840
is usually employees.

293
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,760
Well, it goes without saying

294
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,200
that one of the greatest threats

295
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,880
inside of the casino industry

296
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,640
is collusion between an employee

297
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,600
and an outside force.

298
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,800
Like I've seen in Guatemala,

299
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,640
unfortunately,

300
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,680
that organized crime actually

301
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,360
were threatening

302
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,720
with bodily harm employees

303
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,960
inside of a casino

304
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,640
that if they weren't helping them

305
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,800
rig the cards on a back or a game,

306
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,520
that members of their family

307
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,440
would be hurt or even worse.

308
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,200
Wow.

309
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,520
So, this is a little bit different also

310
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,120
from the classic movie 21

311
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,560
that we're all familiar with

312
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,800
where it's genius mathematicians

313
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,400
counting cards.

314
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,160
It sounds like the whole

315
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,720
the money laundering industry

316
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,680
within the gaming industry

317
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,120
is a little bit

318
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,720
more complicated than that.

319
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,280
It's a lot more complicated,

320
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,440
and it's very invisible

321
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,520
because of the fact that

322
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,720
it's getting very sophisticated

323
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,000
Sure.

324
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,720
which means that if you have a server,

325
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,640
you have an information management system

326
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,800
that's in one casino

327
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,960
and there's a different one

328
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,080
in another one,

329
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,960
well, the money launderers

330
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,640
and the card counters

331
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,480
on the blackjack side,

332
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,840
they will just dabble in different places

333
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,400
so that they're so far under the radar

334
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,200
of what any algorithm inside

335
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,080
of a one lone silo place could offer

336
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,720
in terms of intelligence, richness,

337
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,120
big data, micro data sets,

338
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,160
you'll never find them.

339
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,480
But when you're running

340
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,360
big data algorithms

341
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,080
like the algorithms we have,

342
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,240
we start by running them

343
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,200
over the whole planet.

344
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,440
So, they're running over 50 countries.

345
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:42,840
Wow.

346
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,400
Then we bring them down into regional,

347
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,480
then we bring them down

348
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,880
into micro algorithms.

349
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,520
So, as I'm sure you know,

350
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,960
there's a big difference

351
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,760
between big data and micro data.

352
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,400
We do both,

353
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,240
because you have to catch them

354
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,040
wherever they're trying to cheat the data.

355
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,840
And so, walk me through the process

356
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,680
of catching somebody

357
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,760
who's trying to cheat the data.

358
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,240
Oh, that's not our job.

359
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,160
I stay away from that.

360
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,210
No no no, not the physical.

361
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,440
because they'll come after me

362
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,120
and bury me.

363
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,400
All we do is,

364
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,960
we get a flagged transaction that says,

365
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,040
"This transaction looks suspecting"

366
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,640
and the email goes off

367
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,920
to the appropriate person, and that person-

368
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,240
What could be a trigger of that, though?

369
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,680
So, could that be that they're winning

370
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,120
an unexpected amount of money?

371
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,400
Oh, they don't want to win.

372
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
They don't want to win.

373
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,480
What they want to do

374
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,240
is cash in money, play a little bit

375
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,520
so that the unclean money

376
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,280
goes into a legitimate machine.

377
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,720
Right.

378
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,840
You play a little bit,

379
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,800
and then you take it back out

380
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,680
so that it becomes

381
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,640
a legitimate amount of money

382
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,160
because it's been cashed in

383
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,720
to that environment.

384
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,480
Then you might see in sophisticated places

385
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,000
where they'll move

386
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,640
to one machine to another

387
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,120
to bring down the actual amount

388
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,720
that they're going to cash out.

389
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,640
There's several different models

390
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,800
I'd like to call it,

391
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,160
but it's all the same thing;

392
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,440
it's trying to move money

393
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,080
out of a legitimate source

394
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,200
into a legitimate system.

395
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,840
Wow.

396
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,120
So, now that AXES.ai

397
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,240
have been around for about 10 years

398
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,800
and you're operating in 50 countries,

399
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,480
how big is the problem today?

400
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,320
How big is cheating in casinos today?

401
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,760
I'm not going to say it's alarming

402
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,960
because of the fact that

403
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,400
a lot of the countries

404
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,480
that were behind in technology

405
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,120
are now leaping forward in technology.

406
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,520
Like if you look at Mexico,

407
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,960
which was really a place

408
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,320
that needed to be cleaned up very bad

409
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,280
about 15 years ago,

410
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,720
when you look at it today,

411
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
it's using cashless technology,

412
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,840
it's using all kinds of algorithms,

413
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,600
it's really taking leaps forward.

414
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,640
The problem is not, what I'd like to say

415
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,400
a 911 in the language we use here

416
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,200
in the United States,

417
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,080
but it's a serious problem

418
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,040
that has to be dealt with

419
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,400
on a global level.

420
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,920
That's the reason why I'm a big fan

421
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,240
of a cashless society,

422
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,560
because if you can't move dirty money

423
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,520
into a clean space, well,

424
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,480
you can only be inside

425
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,880
of a clean environment.

426
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,840
And I know that

427
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,720
you're also pretty involved

428
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,920
with blockchain in general,

429
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,000
so I assume that

430
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,920
the passion for that

431
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,480
comes from a similar understanding, right?

432
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,000
Well, it's because AI is dependent

433
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,040
on the integrity of the data it's using.

434
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,360
If you can manipulate the data,

435
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,080
if you can skew the data,

436
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,920
if you can delete the data,

437
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,640
your algorithm is actually corrupt

438
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,720
without you knowing it.

439
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,440
Whereas if you're using

440
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,720
any form of blockchain,

441
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,120
whether it be centralized

442
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,320
or decentralized blockchain

443
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,040
I really don't care,

444
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,000
you're saying that the security

445
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,760
and the integrity of the data

446
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,160
is the underlying food

447
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,600
that you're feeding the algorithms.

448
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,640
Definitely.

449
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,400
That's why AI without blockchain,

450
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,960
for me, is whatever.

451
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,680
When you started out AXES.ai

452
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,720
and you're trying to build these models

453
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,440
that are looking at the gaming industry,

454
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,960
and I can only imagine

455
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,800
'cause you go into a casino,

456
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,520
there's so many

457
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,600
different types of machines,

458
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,720
so many different types of behaviors

459
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,280
that could happen,

460
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,480
and it's really a fascinating realm

461
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,400
from a psychological aspect.

462
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,040
But do you have to onboard people

463
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,880
that are specialized in gaming

464
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,480
or there's simply great engineers

465
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,600
and you're explaining to them

466
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,680
how the gaming industry works?

467
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,160
Because you yourself,

468
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,640
it doesn't sound like

469
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,920
you're a gamer by heart, right?

470
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,840
No, I'm not.

471
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,520
And I'll say that I've been blessed

472
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,200
at AXES,

473
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,360
because when I look at my whole team

474
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,200
around the world

475
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,480
and the different offices we have,

476
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,480
I'm surrounded by geniuses.

477
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,360
Whether they like gaming or not

478
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,160
has no bearing on what we do,

479
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,440
because, the second blessing of any leader,

480
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,720
and I'm going to say this

481
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,520
for the startups

482
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
not for the large mega companies

483
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,920
on the DOW or whatever,

484
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,280
but if you're smart enough as a leader,

485
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,760
you'll let your clients teach you.

486
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,320
My first sentence

487
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,120
that I always give to my clients is,

488
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,080
"Hey, I don't know your business.

489
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,040
And I'll be honest,

490
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,520
I'll probably never know it

491
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,680
as good as you do.

492
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,120
So, if you teach me

493
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,640
what you need to teach me

494
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,120
so that I can protect you

495
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,600
and give you tools

496
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,920
to go bigger, better, faster, I say

497
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,280
we'll have a great marriage together"

498
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,280
So, we do have people on our team

499
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,040
that know gaming,

500
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,520
but that's not the heart of who we are;

501
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,680
who we are is listening to our clients

502
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,760
and following them on their path.

503
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,960
What does a casino look like

504
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,560
in 5, 10 years

505
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,920
given that we go back

506
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,040
to in-person entertainment

507
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,800
and all of that?

508
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,680
You've just hit it on the nose.

509
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,880
Online gaming is becoming the staple

510
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,720
for somebody who wants to spin

511
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,720
a virtual slot machine for 10 minutes,

512
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,800
and win, lose or whatever, it doesn't matter.

513
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,280
But at the end of the day,

514
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,920
a casino is really

515
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,360
a gathering point for entertainment.

516
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,680
Even in the smallest little casinos

517
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,320
that I've been in

518
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,640
in Africa or in the Philippines

519
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,800
or anywhere else,

520
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,560
there's always an intersection

521
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,800
between food, between social,

522
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,200
between playing that

523
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,080
20, 40, 60, 80 dollars

524
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,880
that you have in your pocket.

525
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,120
And I'll always believe

526
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,720
that bricks and mortar

527
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,040
are going to be around forever,

528
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,680
because, as covid has shown us,

529
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,560
everybody who ran home in March goes,

530
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,360
"Yes, work from home."

531
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,000
Then the personality types

532
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,480
started to emerge between May, June, July,

533
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,840
and we realized some people need to be

534
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,680
in a social environment all the time,

535
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
some people don't want to be

536
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,360
in a social environment any time.

537
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
But the majority,

538
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,000
the 60% that are living

539
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,160
on the top of the bell curve,

540
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,960
they need to be in a social environment

541
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,040
some of the time, all the time.

542
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,640
Earle, this was all fascinating.

543
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,760
Before we leave, last question,

544
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,520
'cause we talked about this

545
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,100
briefly before, talk to me a little bit

546
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,960
about neuroscience, AI,

547
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,000
something that you're particularly excited

548
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,440
or scared about.

549
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,040
Give me your one or two minute brief

550
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,360
about your understanding

551
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,320
of neuroscience and AI,

552
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,000
and where you're in it?

553
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,720
Well, I'm dug in deep to the relation

554
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,520
between the pituitary gland

555
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,280
and the pineal gland.

556
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,360
Why? Because the pituitary gland

557
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,680
is really the seat of the animal brain,

558
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,520
and the pineal gland is really the seed

559
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,280
of the human brain.

560
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,320
And they're constantly in conflict

561
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,440
between fight and flight

562
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,720
and trying to find that Zen moment

563
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,280
where you're inspired

564
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,480
to really be who you are.

565
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,680
Right.

566
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,840
And the more that I looked at technology

567
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,080
over the last 20 years,

568
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,520
I realized that the only way

569
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,360
to understand artificial intelligence

570
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,520
or enhanced intelligence,

571
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,040
is to understand the difference between

572
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,280
the lower and the higher brain.

573
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,040
So, I started to dig in,

574
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,520
and I dug in for personal reasons.

575
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,680
I lived a very traumatic event

576
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,960
in my personal life with my son.

577
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,120
And I set out on a journey

578
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,680
to fix what I broke with my son.

579
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,680
And that just led me in a direction

580
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,200
that was so beautiful,

581
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,040
because today, when I look forward,

582
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,760
I see the human,

583
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,960
I see information technology,

584
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,480
I see the intersection,

585
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,440
and I'm putting back on my warrior suit

586
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,200
to make sure that

587
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,640
I'm on the right side of this fight.

588
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,440
I just love it.

589
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,520
Earle, this was so insightful

590
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,920
and so inspiring.

591
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,760
Thank you for taking the time to do this.

592
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,320
Before we leave,

593
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,040
I have to ask you for three words

594
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,880
that you would use to describe yourself.

595
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,680
Inspiring others to be themselves.

596
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,040
Inspiring others to be themselves.

597
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,240
I think it's the hardest thing

598
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,440
a human has to figure out,

599
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,280
it's to learn how to be

600
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,480
and trust themselves.

601
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,120
So, that's really a big part of my job is

602
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,120
sticking the mirror in my team's faces

603
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,920
and making them realize

604
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,040
how absolutely beautiful they really are.

605
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,360
Earle, thank you very, very much.

606
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,280
This was just wonderful.

607
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,880
Continue doing good for the world.

608
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,760
And stay safe and stay healthy.

609
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,200
Thank you very much for the invite.

610
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,600
I absolutely love what you're doing.

611
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,800
Congratulations.

612
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,920
Thank you. Bye bye.

613
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,000
Take care.
