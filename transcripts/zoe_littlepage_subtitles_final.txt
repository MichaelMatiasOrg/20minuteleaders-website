Zoe, thank you so much for being on my show 20 minute leaders I cannot believe I have you on this show this is amazing thank you for having me that's great so, disclaimer your son is one of my best friends and a huge inspiration for me all the way back from high school, we met on the Playa at Burning Man I believe it was 2014 when he graciously invited my father and I go to your wonderful camp, which has evolved so beautifully over the years we joined you at three time radio and head life changing experiences at Burning Man but while you're a burner and you're all competing in the world, in the global scavenger hunt, actually competing your winning the global scavenger hunt more so competing a you're actually a pretty incredible litigator and you're fighting for some really important causes Zoe, who are you? once and for all, clear this up for me, who are you? I think I'm a person like most people that are working hard in their profession is I'm a lot of things you know, I'm a mom I'm definitely a burner I definitely am addicted to adventure travel and I had the great fortune of choosing a career that I love and that has always brought me great joy and frustrations and successes and failures but I think if you start off on a track that you know you love, you're never going to be bored or disappointed wonderful, you know, I mean, the Jewish Mom tradition that we know is that, yeah you can be a Doctor or a lawyer regardless if you could or not but you're a lawyer that you'll love, you're doing you're litigating why do you love it so much what is it about it excites you? when I was a little girl, I knew that I had an inherent talent, that I was not afraid of speaking in public and most people are terrified of speaking in public so it's sort of like a superpower the number one fear in the world yes, it's a superpower if you're not afraid of it and I realize I like speaking in public and I wasn't afraid of it and there was only a few professions that pay you to speak in public politician, lawyer and so very young I realized I wanted to litigate because that was a way to get paid, to do what I liked and what I had an inherent talent for for well, you could have also gone to L.A and Hollywood and go on Broadway but you chose to be in the courtroom but the courtroom is theater in its own way. if you are not entertaining and persuading and keeping the jurors attention you're not winning I love it ok, so so litigator, lawyer and what type of lawyer are you? because you get to deal with some really crazy cases It's not just this, you know, these ordinary cases that we hear about on TV I have been lucky in that I never had to do sort of entry level legal work of car accidents and slip and falls I got into a practice early on that did big cases and then I formed my own firm and I've always had my choice of cases so I got to choose the people I represented I've always represented people injured by the negligent or gross negligent conduct of corporations and other people and I have had great the honor of speaking for people whose lives have been destroyed by the negligence of others and that is as a true honor you know that that's insane because it's not just about somebody life's being ... and then going for them and speaking out about it but you're actually tackling some huge corporation, hundreds of billions of dollars or a hundred million dollars who have, you know, in comparison to the resources that the individual has It's uncomfortable and here you come saying well, we're the underdogs, I'm going to represent you and we are going to be better than than the dozen lawyers that they're putting up but how fun is that is to choose a profession where the people you're against are the best money can buy I go against the most powerful and well-funded corporations, and they can afford the best lawyers which means you're always going against people who make you up your game and be the top of your game yeah, so I'm I'm not sure you can disclose this but is there like one case of one example of a case that has been public disclosure that you can just mention what type of just to give a context of what types of cases the art you're tackling yeah so for a long time, I represented women who had developed breast cancer from taking a defective drug, a hormone therapy drug and menopause and there were women who should never have had breast cancer their family had should never have gone through that experience some of them had died from the breast cancer and it was really rewarding they were older women who had been very trusting of the drug industry, really trusting that the pharmaceuticals they were taking were really just going to be beneficial and not hurt them and then they got this terrible diagnosis and went through years of treatment and fear and so representing them and getting justice for them and their family was incredible and it was against both Wyeth and Pfizer, two of the largest companies in the world unbelievable unbelievable so so paint me a picture as you're standing there in the courtroom and you have a and you have a jury and and you're talking about, you know, these are emotional subjects people's lives are being ruined how do you even go about approaching a case like this when you're saying, like, wow, I have to deal with with Pfizer and why it's I think you have to come from a place of gratitude that your client has has gifted you this opportunity to speak for them my clients either are dead or sick they can't understand the concepts of a courtroom and they need someone to advocate for them so being a litigator is truly an honor of being an advocate you get to tell their story you get to show the jury what they went through with the decisions that were made at the corporate level that were decisions that ended up really hurting this family and this person and once you come from that part, then you speak with authentic passion, because I truly believe in the In the veracity of my client's case, I believe in what they're trying to do and then I speak from my heart and once you are passionately trying to get that message across, the juries will listen Zoe, that's beautiful and I have to say that while you're explaining I, I, I don't know that side of you in court because I know the At Burning Man and, you know, going to going and eating dinner together out outside of burning but, you know, the side that I also see is that you're bringing this heart and passion for your personal life I mean, I'm meeting these people that are joining our camp at Burning Man whose lives you've literally transformed and they have so much gratitude for what you've given them and I know you're too humble to come and say, yeah, I did that but but it but it's true and I speak also personally and there's like Zoe did this for me It's The Burning Man but my whole life and I think just it's remarkable and it just shines and you've been an inspiration for me over these past six years that I've had that I've had the privilege of knowing you but you're also so adventurous out of the courtroom talk to me a little bit about this, this burner within you what is it about burning now that attracted you so much? I think if you haven't been to Burning Man, then it's hard to put it into words but there is a impossible yeah, there is a core to Burning Man, which is a belief that together we can be better, that if we have each other's back, if we go into the desert with no water and electricity and you can't buy or sell anything, you have to rely on each other to survive and to have fun and it's hard fun, you know, your hot you don't have air conditioning hard fun it's hard fun but if you can do that, if you can really embrace the the sense of community and to be together, we are better then Burning Man is a transformational experience as you feel the Zen of that community definitely definitely and so just to paint a picture of the Burning Man project is a seven or eight days where we go into the desert to fly a black rock city about three hours into the Nevada desert and we form a community of about 70 or 80 thousand individuals that are becoming a family and sort of like a total in mindset and, you know, one of the things that I also spoke about this with my father extensively the first time we came you, you ride your bike down down the street that you create and there's not a single piece of trash on the hole and you just think to your self wow there's so much junk that everybody is bringing in and and, you know, the fight that you have to take everything out with you and because of this social responsibility, we community, we keep it clean and we keep the same values I think that's just incredible and the world can learn so much from this project I agree and, you know, what we learn is that if we have to rely on each other, we all have to uphold that societal bond we have to take care of ourselves we have to take care of our own trash we can't leave other people to pick up our leftovers you know, we have to work together and that is the sense that's the essence of Burning Man definitely definitely ok and so we're going to leave time and talk about the Athena project that that you just started but before that, you are competing in one of the world's craziest adventures, the global scavenger hunt, which is the number one on my bucket list to do and you're not you're not only competing, you're winning it It's almost every time that you participate tell me about this global scavenger hunt, everything and you go around the world and do these crazy experiences it's a wonderful nonprofit that raises money for charity and it's put on by an inspired couple who really believe that the way for people to appreciate being global citizens is to see the world in a new way and so it's a blind date with the world you don't know where you're going you don't know how long you're going to spend there you don't know what you're gonna have to do when you get there and you basically blindly take this date with the world you show up in some place on the West Coast and for the next twenty three days, you're going to go west around the world, circumnavigate the world you're going to stop in 11, 12, 13 countries each time you land wow and I know you don't know which ones you get one small suitcase so you have to sort of pack layers because you don't know if you're going cold or hot and when you land in each country, the producer of the event gives you a booklet of challenges, scavenges, puzzles, things you have to discover, decipher, clues you have to use you cannot use any electronics, which is so scary because we're used to Googling everything you cannot use any electronics yes, you cannot use any electronic maps you have to walk out of the hotel and just stop people and start interacting in whatever country you are using charades because you don't speak the language and have locals from that country help you decipher these scavenges and point you in the right direction and get you to the places you need to go to make the points and in each country the person who does the most makes the most points and wins that leg and then if you win enough legs, then you become first, second or third in the competition but it's all one of the flaws, of course. of course, no but so effectively, it's like the amazing race without cameras more authentic and for a good cause for charity and it's designed to try and make you look at things from different group's perspective so for one example, we were in Cairo and obviously if you're in Cairo, you want to go to the Sphinx but we had to first go to the grand souk and buy traditional African headgear then we had to go to a camel stable and rent camels we had to put on the African headgear, get on the camels ride over the dunes and we approached the Sphinx from the dunes on camels in African headgear so you see that experience of approaching the Sphinx is from a different from a different way, a more authentic, interesting way and that's what he wants you to do get out of your tourist mode, up where we're going to eat next what tourist attraction we're going to go take pictures at and do something different when we went to China you had to run a mile on the Great Wall of China like you didn't just get to go off and take your picture you had to do something when we went to Tiananmen Square, you had to approach a family and get them to agree to fly a kite with one of their kids and take a picture of you and the kid flying a kite in Tiananmen Square, which means you had to interact with people and talk to them and explain what you were doing and ask questions and feel like you were really appreciating the country in a different way so it sounds so incredible ok so at FEMA, that FEMA joint project to empower women litigators, the video is so amazing and it's so inspiring but tell me a little bit about what how did this come about, especially in times of Covid-19? well, pandemic we're all shut in and we just had this brainstorm of we there are very few women run law firms still I know that's incredible, but it still is true and six very powerful women who all run their own law firms who are really well-respected in the in the field decided, why don't we start pooling our reputation and everything that we have put together over the decades and help other women litigators so women who leave a law firm to start their own shop and they can't get a credit line could we provide funding women who think when they show up at mediation, they don't have the reputation to really get full value for their cases? can we put our name behind them? can we help those people brainstorm? can we help those people redo their trial strategies? and one of the things we found is when men-run, firms came to us for help getting their trials together, redoing their case strategies one of the requirements was you had to have a woman on your trial team or we wouldn't help so, you know, I love it, just to try to push more firms to think always can we have a diverse trial team? can we make sure there's at least one woman on every trial team to put more women in the courtroom? I love it I love it so tangibly, how did this work as the six of you, you're running your own firms you're extremely busy with your own cases so are you sort of like a board? you have applicants come in and you form relationships and you back them both with perhaps funding, but mainly reputation is that how it works? yes, or we can work with them if they're if they've got a case that they feel is a little bit too big for them, we can come in and help them try the case we can work with them we can share the funding on the case we can share the fee on the case we the purpose is to really give women options that is not really available right now of having support, money, reputation, experience, and to just kind of do plus honestly we just love working together and it's a great opportunity for us to work cooperatively me and these other five women that I love and who are so talented, I learn every conversation we have I learn so much about how they look at a case or how they work on the case or different ideas of how to really make something more persuasive so it's just been great fun but I think we're also have an opportunity to do some real good I love it, you know, so Zoe we just have a few minutes left but I'd love to I'd love to pick your brain as someone you're dedicating your life to the community and people and to thinking of who has wronged who and how can we correct this this wrongdoing? and I'd let go maybe 30,000 feet in the air and sort of look at our society and hear a little bit about, about what you think we do as as global citizens to improve our society and to boost the number of of these things that are happening it sounds very cliche, but I wonder but I really am interested in concerned about this I think the most important thing is that we have to accept that we are global citizens we are not Americans we are not Texans we are not Californians we are global citizens in this world everybody is connected and maybe it's because I'm an immigrant but I think it's really special when you start to see your place in the world as not just a person, but a global community and that requires us putting down some of our nationalism and populism and really working together to make the planet a better place from global warming to climate change to trade deals we have got to work together the inequality, the income inequality is is startling we have got to make the whole world a more equitable place, both in terms of the planet and just what we do every day and that starts with us thinking of ourselves as a part of a very big picture, which is this whole planet oh, definitely but but you know so it sounds like so this is sort of a bottom up approach saying we need to rethink our values and to intend that we are we are global citizens but at the end, a lot of it is also top down where you know, where most of us are following along the different politicians up there or the different leaders that that are dictating sort of how we should behave and how we should think well, how tangibly can we be can we can we tackle this? and how do we expect, you know, 300 million people to think for themselves and not just take for granted what what the leaders are necessarily saying? I think we have to come from a place of much more kindness and loving appreciation than we do right now the divisiveness has got to stop It's got to be it's we've got to stop being different tribes I mean, this country is tribal and really we're all global and we've got to get back there, we've got to stop the divisiveness we've got to appreciate each other, love each other, be kind to each other and particularly now take care of each other oh yeah do the right thing so that everybody, even the vulnerable and especially the old are protected and we've got to start rethinking that and put down these tribalism and this divisiveness one hundred percent now, you know, I took a course at Stanford this year called the Spirit of Democracy with the world expert Larry Diamond and one the things he's talking about, his deterioration, the deterioration of democracy not just in the US, but around the world and part of it is that we we forget to look up and to to consider what's actually happening around and get out of the small bubble of that that we're being fitted in sometimes wrongfully and I think that's I definitely agree kindness, empathy I think this scavenger hunt this sort of ability to go and meet these different colors and flying a kite in Tiananmen Square instead of going and taking a picture as a tourist that's that's definitely, I think the right path Zoe, before we go, I ask you the hardest question and I'm putting you a little bit on the spot here, but I'd love for you to tell me three words that best describe you I would probably say passionate, because I feel very strongly about my my career and what I do for a living I would say generous, because I think it's very important that people who have had gifts and had opportunities be generous to others don't pull the ladder up behind you, but help other people up that ladder I love that metaphor And I would say spirited because I'm a force to be reckoned with when I put my mind to something 100 percent and I I can definitely attest to that Zoe, thank you so for the time thank you for the inspiration with everything that you're doing it's really wonderful and please send it send my regards to your wonderful, wonderful son thank you and good luck to you, love thank you
