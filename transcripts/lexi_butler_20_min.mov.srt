1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,720
I think everyone is a freedom fighter,

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,080
I get this question asked a lot.

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,520
I think that we are all born

4
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,680
with the innate skill to freedom fight.

5
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,924
I think that some people choose to

6
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:10,272
really dig deep into that

7
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:12,150
and some people choose to not.

8
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,493
Alexandria Butler, thank you so much

9
00:00:44,494 --> 00:00:45,930
for being with me on my show,

10
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:46,699
20 Minute Leaders.

11
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,200
How are you?

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,680
I'm good.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,800
Thank you so much for having me.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,080
How are you?

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,480
I am fantastic.

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:51,840
Thank you.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,440
I'm very excited to have you on the show.

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,680
Because it's always incredible for me

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,203
to speak to people who are

20
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,960
so passionate about a multitude of things.

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800
And I'm excited to both dive deep

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,320
into your experience as a program manager

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,530
at Facebook, Airbnb,

24
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,438
most recently now Twitter.

25
00:01:06,638 --> 00:01:08,080
Also a Stanford graduate.

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,616
But I'm even more interested

27
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:13,080
to hear about you as a freedom fighter.

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,000
And that's not something that I see

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,160
on LinkedIn every day as a title.

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
Let's start with that.

31
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,600
What is being a freedom fighter?

32
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:25,840
So, I think everyone is a freedom fighter.

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,240
I get this question asked a lot.

34
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,680
I think that we are all born

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,800
with the innate skill to freedom fight.

36
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,044
I think that some people choose to

37
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:34,455
really dig deep into that

38
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:35,944
and some people choose to not,

39
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:37,640
which is really unfortunate.

40
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,724
And so, how I define freedom fighting

41
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,160
is just seeing something that is wrong

42
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,160
and taking the steps,

43
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,680
whatever steps and privilege

44
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,800
that you have to try to change it.

45
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
And so for me,

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,631
as a black woman in the technology industry

47
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:53,160
and coming from Stanford,

48
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,760
I never wanted to go into tech.

49
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,613
If you talk to anybody

50
00:01:55,813 --> 00:01:57,075
that I went to undergrad with,

51
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:58,782
I'm sure they're still laughing

52
00:01:58,982 --> 00:02:00,240
that I'm in the tech industry.

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,880
I just sort of

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,578
stumbled into it with this idea that

55
00:02:04,778 --> 00:02:06,680
I'm going to be here for a year or two

56
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,090
as I figure out my life, and then

57
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,680
I'm going to go do something else.

58
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,200
And I realized pretty quickly

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,880
that I actually really enjoy it.

60
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,244
But there were all these gaps.

61
00:02:15,444 --> 00:02:17,085
One being very young,

62
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:19,378
being 22, and not knowing what's going on

63
00:02:19,578 --> 00:02:21,477
and really not having access

64
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:23,240
or not having a leadership

65
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,520
that really understood this concept.

66
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,440
That at 22,

67
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,680
regardless of what college you go to,

68
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,306
you know nothing about life.

69
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,364
In what does it mean

70
00:02:31,564 --> 00:02:33,711
to bring in new college grads and say:

71
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,400
Okay, so we know that we employed you,

72
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,012
but we also know that

73
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:38,716
we need to build programs

74
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,560
that help you figure out how to adult 101.

75
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,160
Right?

76
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,477
And so that was really my first step

77
00:02:43,677 --> 00:02:44,547
of really imbibing was.

78
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,059
That's where the gap was for me at 22.

79
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:48,520
I felt like I had a job.

80
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,520
I worked, I had management,

81
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,200
I had people that worked around me,

82
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,313
that were showing me how to do my job.

83
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,703
But nobody was showing me

84
00:02:55,903 --> 00:02:56,640
how to be an adult.

85
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,966
And then I would start talking

86
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,627
to other people at my company

87
00:02:59,827 --> 00:03:03,280
that were my age and they had the same issue.

88
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,440
So, I said, "Okay. So, why don't we just

89
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,253
require leadership to give us those skills."

90
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:11,624
Either: a. give us those skills,

91
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,960
b. give us the time to find those skills,

92
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,735
or c. give us money to bring in people

93
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:18,560
to teach us those skills.

94
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,320
And so, I went to the head of engineering

95
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,638
for the company that I was working in

96
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:25,298
because I was an engineering program manager.

97
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:26,640
And he knew me somewhat.

98
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,360
And I said, "I need $10,000

99
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,040
to start a new college grad program

100
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,040
because we don't know what we're doing."

101
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,360
Right?

102
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,520
And he said, "Okay. Sure."

103
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,920
And remember, in the tech industry,

104
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,040
ten grand is actually not a lot of money.

105
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,360
And so, I use this skill of mine,

106
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,196
which was asking questions and just kind of

107
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:46,187
walking and interrupting spaces and saying,

108
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:47,680
but this is what I need

109
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,383
to really bring together

110
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,440
the new college grads that I was working with.

111
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,400
So, at 22, that was my freedom fight.

112
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,320
And then as I got older, I recognized

113
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,800
that I have another freedom fight.

114
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,588
And that's being a black woman

115
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:00,840
in the tech industry.

116
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,480
As a black woman who was raised,

117
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,600
born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri,

118
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
I completely understood blackness.

119
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,920
I'm very aware of that.

120
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,400
And I'm honored to be a black woman.

121
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,000
I think it's the best trait about me

122
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,440
is this womanhood and this connection

123
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,760
to something as beautiful

124
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,320
as black Americanness.

125
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,440
Yet, I'm also aware that I live in a world

126
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,640
and live in a country that that's very

127
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,400
polarizing and can be very political.

128
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,772
And people think certain things of me

129
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,160
that really just fundamentally aren't true.

130
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,480
And so, walking around the tech industry,

131
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,320
I was one of my own.

132
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,000
There were other black women.

133
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,107
But either: a. they were much older than me,

134
00:04:40,307 --> 00:04:41,364
or they did not work

135
00:04:41,564 --> 00:04:43,160
in the same department that I did.

136
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,375
And so, I said, "Okay. We have to fix that."

137
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:46,985
Because I need to figure out

138
00:04:47,185 --> 00:04:49,400
how I'm going to rise up the ranks.

139
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,230
I need to figure out

140
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,320
how I'm going to do well at my career.

141
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,640
And in order to do that, I need mentorship

142
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,520
from all different types of people.

143
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,280
But there are specific conversations

144
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,265
and specific understandings

145
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:03,960
that I can really only have with black women.

146
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,976
And so, I started a Facebook group called,

147
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:07,560
Sista Circle: Black Women In Tech

148
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,914
in 2017 and just invited black women

149
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:12,960
who work in tech and to go to brunch.

150
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,820
And now we have over 7,000 women

151
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,960
all over the world.

152
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,120
Wow.

153
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,400
Yeah. We partner with tech companies

154
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,600
to start really having these

155
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,040
important conversations.

156
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,327
And these important conversations

157
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:25,198
are not just DNI focus,

158
00:05:25,398 --> 00:05:27,080
diversity and inclusion focus.

159
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:28,162
I always tell people,

160
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:30,264
"Black women do not need to be preached to

161
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,915
about diversity and inclusion."

162
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:34,200
Like we already know that's an issue.

163
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,309
But what we do need

164
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,520
is we need to have conversations

165
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,931
about how we level up in our career

166
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,672
because people usually exclude us

167
00:05:41,872 --> 00:05:42,840
from those conversations.

168
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,423
So, whether it's partnering with

169
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:45,316
a tech company

170
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:47,000
and having a negotiations workshop

171
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,960
or partnering with another company

172
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,480
and talking about how do you go

173
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,920
from an individual contributor

174
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,800
to a manager and things like that.

175
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,640
So, how do we grow ourselves?

176
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,745
So we are not only prepared

177
00:05:57,945 --> 00:05:59,203
for the next step,

178
00:05:59,403 --> 00:06:01,720
but we know how to funnel this magic

179
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,480
that the world has given us

180
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,560
in the best way.

181
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,320
So, yeah, that's what I do.

182
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,160
So, what's so inspiring to me

183
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
with what you're saying,

184
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,640
so a lot of the time when I hear about

185
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,360
people that are passionate about

186
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,504
the diversity and inclusion,

187
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:15,402
and I'm personally,

188
00:06:15,602 --> 00:06:16,320
obviously very passionate

189
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,280
about those topics myself.

190
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,080
But a lot of the times it's very general

191
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,360
and it almost seems like

192
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,664
I'm talking to people it's like,

193
00:06:22,864 --> 00:06:25,080
well, what can I do as an individual person?

194
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,400
And what impact can I have?

195
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,980
And all of a sudden,

196
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,140
here I'm hearing you talk about

197
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,480
this very specific idea that you had:

198
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,769
how can I help black women in tech

199
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:35,840
support each other, aid each other,

200
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,077
get tech companies to come

201
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:38,924
and give us these negotiations,

202
00:06:39,124 --> 00:06:40,040
workshops and classes

203
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,360
and help and create a supportive community?

204
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,760
And I can only imagine the amazing impact

205
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,080
you have on those thousands of women.

206
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,960
And the lesson that I'm taking away

207
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,631
from this is: we can all have an impact

208
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:52,480
in our immediate community.

209
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,413
We don't have to,

210
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,614
it's not an all or nothing game,

211
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:57,240
which is to me really inspiring.

212
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,458
And that's what freedom fighting is, right?

213
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:00,725
Because I always tell folk:

214
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:03,040
"My day job is not diversity and inclusion."

215
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,038
I happen to be a black woman

216
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:06,427
who works in an industry

217
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,240
that there are not a lot of black women.

218
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,177
I happen to be a black woman

219
00:07:10,377 --> 00:07:12,852
who lives in America and has received

220
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:14,760
some of the most egregious impressions

221
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,262
that you could ever imagine

222
00:07:16,462 --> 00:07:17,600
because of what I look like.

223
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,480
And so, therefore,

224
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,440
because of those experiences,

225
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,961
I'm also very aware of how

226
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:25,640
I will and will not be treated,

227
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,764
whether I am at work

228
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,560
or whether I'm at home.

229
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,560
And so, what happens when I stand

230
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,120
in that power, even when I'm at work,

231
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,840
not even talking about Sista Circle,

232
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,166
but talking about my day job

233
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:40,155
and talking to my manager

234
00:07:40,355 --> 00:07:42,870
or having conversations with my co-workers,

235
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,640
because that's freedom fighting as well.

236
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,120
Right?

237
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,096
Being in a room and helping build a product

238
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:48,520
and raising my hand and saying,

239
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,210
"Hey, are we thinking about black people

240
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,160
when we as we're doing this?"

241
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,461
"Hey, have you thought about

242
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,960
how that may affect ABC community?

243
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,729
Hey, so I notice that this room

244
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,172
is somewhat diverse, but it'd be great

245
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:04,000
if we had this type of person in the room

246
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,320
to give this perspective,

247
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,050
because I know I can't give that

248
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,040
and I know all of you can't give that.

249
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,640
And we need that perspective

250
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,320
before we launch this product."

251
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,040
And that is really what freedom fighting is.

252
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,566
It's this intentionality to say that

253
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:19,600
I don't have all the answers.

254
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,610
So, I either:

255
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,640
a. The answers that I do have speak up,

256
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,388
or b. The answers that I don't have speak up

257
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:29,067
and literally drag the person in the room

258
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:30,769
that I think has the answer

259
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,040
or knows the person who has the answer.

260
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,400
Because that's what diversity

261
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,480
and inclusion really is.

262
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,520
It's just be the person in the room

263
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,240
that says something's not right.

264
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,937
So, if all I have to do is just

265
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:43,600
go find the person to fix this,

266
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,520
I have no problem sending that email.

267
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,800
How do we make this a norm?

268
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,546
So, not every company

269
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:51,260
has an Alexandria working for,

270
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,346
and obviously looking at your incredible lineup

271
00:08:54,546 --> 00:08:57,760
of amazing companies that you've supported

272
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,640
shows us what you bring in to the table.

273
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,757
But what can every startup that's growing

274
00:09:02,957 --> 00:09:05,305
or every company, what can we do

275
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:07,360
to make this more of a norm,

276
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,840
to keep having this mindset of:

277
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,640
can we think critically

278
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,520
about who's in this room,

279
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,760
who are we representing,

280
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,600
who are we supporting on the other side,

281
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,920
and who are potential customers

282
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,960
that we might not even be thinking of?

283
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:19,920
I always tell people

284
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,400
to recognize your own privilege, right?

285
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,240
It was funny.

286
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,840
I was joking with the co-worker last week

287
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,080
about this, and I said,

288
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,610
"I find it interesting that people

289
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,960
refuse to deal with their trauma,

290
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,310
but instead want to put their trauma on me,

291
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,120
which makes no actual sense." Right?

292
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,937
So, deal with yours and then come talk to me.

293
00:09:36,137 --> 00:09:38,007
And to me what that means is that

294
00:09:38,207 --> 00:09:39,740
in order to be that person,

295
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,621
you have to know yourself fully.

296
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:43,040
And to know yourself fully,

297
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,143
you have to recognize

298
00:09:44,343 --> 00:09:46,393
your layers of privilege.

299
00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:48,280
In any given situation,

300
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,040
you have the most privileged in the room,

301
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,172
you may have the middle

302
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:53,716
or you may have the least.

303
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,920
Unfortunately, because of white supremacy,

304
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,172
we identify people

305
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:59,120
based on what they look like.

306
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,360
But as we all know,

307
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,280
everybody comes from a story.

308
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,695
So, there's lots of privilege

309
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:04,872
that you may not see

310
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,200
when you physically look at my body, right?

311
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,317
Whether it's I,

312
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:10,126
whether it's you have a person

313
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:11,424
that comes from poverty

314
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,579
or whether it's you have a person

315
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,480
that did not grow up with a mom and dad.

316
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:15,800
Right?

317
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,008
Like, you may not physically see

318
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,209
that one themselves,

319
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:20,880
but that is a lack of privilege.

320
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,960
And I think people need

321
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,400
to really do this work.

322
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,760
So, a couple of years ago,

323
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,320
I started this workshop called,

324
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,280
The Privilege Workshop,

325
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,720
which I've been doing with a lot

326
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,400
of companies and groups of people to say,

327
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,280
"Hey, let's just be here for the next two

328
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,867
to three hours and figure out

329
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,560
what your layers of privilege are."

330
00:10:36,561 --> 00:10:38,387
Because I fundamentally believe

331
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:39,926
that if you can identify

332
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:41,320
your layers of privilege,

333
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,160
if you can say, hey, this is my gender,

334
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,520
and because of this gender, it is either

335
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,720
a layer of privilege or it is not.

336
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,760
This is my race.

337
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,000
And because of this race,

338
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,440
it is a layer of privilege or it is not.

339
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,280
This is my educational background.

340
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,720
I know this is a Stanford platform.

341
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,748
And I always tell folks

342
00:10:59,948 --> 00:11:01,249
that I went to Stanford University

343
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,920
and I have to own that privilege.

344
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,320
I went to Stanford University,

345
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,640
which is an elite institution

346
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,400
that I'm very proud of going to.

347
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,320
I'm not going to apologize for my degrees.

348
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,280
But at the same time,

349
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,282
I'm also aware that it is a privilege.

350
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,360
And most people don't have that privilege.

351
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,691
And I'm also not going to sit here

352
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:19,680
and pretend that I don't know

353
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,579
the privilege of going to a school

354
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:27,600
that helped build the industry that I work in.

355
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,240
Right? Like those layer's here.

356
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:29,920
You know what I mean?

357
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,765
It's like going to an Ivy League school

358
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:34,128
on the East Coast

359
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:35,748
and working on Wall Street.

360
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:37,424
There is a privilege there

361
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:39,240
because we all know Wall Street.

362
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,321
Many people from those East Coast schools

363
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:45,680
have funneled and fueled that work force.

364
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,800
So, I can't sit here as a Stanford grad

365
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,350
working in the technology industry

366
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,680
to not accept and identify that privilege,

367
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,640
whether or not I speak it out loud,

368
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,160
but that is there, right?

369
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,400
And once you identify your privileges,

370
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:03,200
if you can identify your privileges,

371
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,640
then you're also at the same time

372
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,440
acknowledging that they exist.

373
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,680
And in that acknowledgement,

374
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,051
you're acknowledging that

375
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:11,480
also, other people don't have those things.

376
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,085
And that's what we all need

377
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:14,628
in these workspaces,

378
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:16,240
is people to acknowledge

379
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,120
what's in front of them,

380
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,080
do not make excuses for it.

381
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,080
I get very tired of people making excuses

382
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,234
for their privilege because most of the time,

383
00:12:26,434 --> 00:12:27,987
privilege is not something

384
00:12:28,187 --> 00:12:29,480
that you did to yourself.

385
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,640
It's things that just happen this way.

386
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,120
It's like a deck of cards.

387
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,478
But honoring that privilege by saying:

388
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,042
so this is what it is,

389
00:12:38,242 --> 00:12:40,148
and how can I give back to people

390
00:12:40,348 --> 00:12:41,880
who don't have that privilege?

391
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,200
So, for me, for example,

392
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,070
how do I give back to people

393
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,965
as a black straight woman

394
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:50,233
working in the technology industry

395
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:52,226
with two Stanford degrees?

396
00:12:52,426 --> 00:12:54,120
How do I give back to people?

397
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,440
Well, one,

398
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,320
You've done a lot.

399
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,237
Yes. Going back to Stanford

400
00:13:00,437 --> 00:13:02,840
and helping Stanford kids in advising,

401
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,720
but also to making sure that I'm talking

402
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,640
to other students who did not go to Stanford.

403
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,040
So, how can I help you?

404
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,840
And let's have these conversations

405
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,280
that I'm very aware that I was having

406
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,880
at 18, 19, 20 years old at Stanford,

407
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,960
that other kids may not have had, right?

408
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,983
Or have had,

409
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:24,135
but never had in a technological lens

410
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:27,320
because Stanford is very techie, right?

411
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,560
And so, that's what I think we all need to do.

412
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,091
And if we all do that work

413
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,960
of getting to know ourselves better,

414
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,797
then when you walk into professional spaces,

415
00:13:35,997 --> 00:13:37,280
you then know yourself.

416
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,022
Then you can also be aware that, like,

417
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,710
oh, so this person doesn't have that

418
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,360
in this moment.

419
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,845
So, how can I just give it to them

420
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:45,920
for a few seconds? Right.

421
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,760
I love it.

422
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,000
Alexandria, a lot of these things are,

423
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,480
we have to look into ourselves

424
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,120
and recognize and I think very critically,

425
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,960
especially in 2020,

426
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,880
I lived in Israel my most of my life,

427
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,676
I came to California this past year

428
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:02,277
to start Stanford and all of a sudden

429
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:04,527
I'm hit with this polarized area

430
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:06,000
where I'm understanding

431
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,480
that there are these deep rooted conflicts

432
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,440
which may have been brushed under the rug

433
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,320
for some people, obviously,

434
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,040
for many others it hasn't been,

435
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
and all of a sudden there is this whole

436
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,203
uprising of polarization of 2020,

437
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,440
and I'm becoming very conscious

438
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:19,880
about it myself.

439
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,288
But what is one thing that

440
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:24,480
every person that listens to this,

441
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,200
including myself and my friends,

442
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,203
can do tangibly to help make things

443
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:31,520
a little bit less polarized,

444
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,080
and help really understand that some of us

445
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,408
come from a more privileged background

446
00:14:36,608 --> 00:14:38,000
and help those that don't?

447
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,381
Stop assuming that your story

448
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:44,680
is the single story of humanness

449
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:46,531
in humanhood, if that's even a term.

450
00:14:46,731 --> 00:14:49,040
It should be a term if it's not.

451
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,040
Stop assuming that your way of life

452
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,367
and your way of thinking

453
00:14:56,567 --> 00:15:00,440
is either the only way or the best way.

454
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,040
Right?

455
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,640
When we are born,

456
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,440
we come into this world with so much stuff.

457
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,897
A lot of that is trauma

458
00:15:12,097 --> 00:15:14,406
that is given to us from our parents

459
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:15,560
and our ancestors.

460
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,360
Not our fault, but it is there

461
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,200
and you have to acknowledge it.

462
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,800
A lot of it is blessings and prayers

463
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,800
and hopes that come from the same people.

464
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,322
A lot of it is the environment

465
00:15:26,522 --> 00:15:27,900
in which we live in.

466
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,760
A lot of which is religion.

467
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,200
Right?

468
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,320
With what religious texts have told us.

469
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,261
And I always tell folks,

470
00:15:35,461 --> 00:15:37,844
I think religion is so beautiful.

471
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:41,161
I love learning about different religions.

472
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,581
I was raised Baptist, black Baptist

473
00:15:43,781 --> 00:15:46,560
coming from the Midwest of the country.

474
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,080
But I think all religions are beautiful.

475
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,280
I'm also aware that religion historically,

476
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,800
including today in present times,

477
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,200
is used to oppress people.

478
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,040
These are not,

479
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,120
and that's not,

480
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,560
that's something that we have to come

481
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,831
to terms with, right?

482
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:08,074
And so, that's important is that

483
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:10,711
you can come to a table with people

484
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:13,400
who are nothing like you.

485
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,020
And regardless if you agree

486
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,000
or disagree with them,

487
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,960
you can look at them like a human and say:

488
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,362
but I want to actively listen to your story.

489
00:16:21,562 --> 00:16:23,000
Because all of us have stories.

490
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,280
And our stories directly

491
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,440
come from our experiences. Right?

492
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,080
To give you an example,

493
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,180
I was on Instagram a few nights ago

494
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,938
and I was actually reading this thing

495
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:38,332
from this person

496
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:40,720
that I went to high school with.

497
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,808
And she is clearly anti abortion.

498
00:16:44,008 --> 00:16:45,680
She is pro-life.

499
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,880
And I was just reading her stance.

500
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,280
I don't agree with her stance.

501
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,240
I am pro-choice.

502
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,247
And I'd like to say that

503
00:16:52,447 --> 00:16:54,041
pro-choice is not pro abortion.

504
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:56,290
It's just pro choice for me is a side ideology

505
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,577
that people have a right to choose

506
00:16:57,777 --> 00:16:58,680
what they want to do with their bodies.

507
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,960
And that's none of my business

508
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,374
and I should not be involved in it.

509
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,590
But, looking at the conversation

510
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,697
and the comments

511
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:06,367
with this woman that I think

512
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,680
she went to college with,

513
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,859
and I don't know this woman,

514
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,960
where this woman was very upset

515
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,760
by this person's beliefs.

516
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,600
And what I came from the conversation was,

517
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,050
wouldn't it be interesting

518
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,040
if both of these people just sat at a table

519
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,782
and had a conversation of

520
00:17:22,982 --> 00:17:25,040
why they believe what they believe.

521
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,000
Yes.

522
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,280
I mean, yeah, beliefs are valid.

523
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,879
And especially in America right now,

524
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,600
this pro-life and pro-choice conversation,

525
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,520
is an historic conversation.

526
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,368
I don't want people to think

527
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,283
that I don't think that.

528
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:40,356
It's a very important conversation.

529
00:17:40,556 --> 00:17:41,480
Especially right now

530
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,920
what's going on today on the Senate floor.

531
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,160
Exactly today.

532
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,076
Exactly today.

533
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,272
It started a couple of hours ago

534
00:17:49,472 --> 00:17:50,520
on the Senate floor.

535
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,496
But what happens

536
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,489
when we can all just sit there

537
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:54,585
and not just say:

538
00:17:54,785 --> 00:17:56,701
okay, so you believe this.

539
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:59,280
But say: so why do you believe this?

540
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,720
Right?

541
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,160
Where does this come from?

542
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,021
And that doesn't mean

543
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:03,840
that when we finish this conversation,

544
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,520
I'm going to agree to your belief.

545
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,720
But at the very basic level,

546
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,080
when we finish this conversation,

547
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,160
I'm going to see you as a human, right?

548
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,177
Exactly to that point.

549
00:18:12,377 --> 00:18:13,240
I have to bring this up

550
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,334
because I had to show a few weeks ago

551
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:17,320
with Professor Larry Diamond from Stanford.

552
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,120
He was one of my first professors.

553
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
He was actually the very first professor

554
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,625
I walked into class on my first day

555
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:25,840
which was called the spirit of Democracy.

556
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,400
And it was such a moving moment

557
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,116
because, and I brought up in that episode

558
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,240
is because 10 minutes into class,

559
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,164
he started tearing up

560
00:18:33,364 --> 00:18:35,040
when he was telling us about an experiment,

561
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,000
him and his colleague, James Fishkin ran

562
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,800
called: America in one room in Texas.

563
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,080
They brought together a random sampling

564
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,040
of hundreds of Democrats,

565
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,440
independents and Republicans.

566
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,425
And for three days,

567
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,960
they had them deliberate with moderators.

568
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,800
And regardless, the change in policies

569
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,480
and the change of thought,

570
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,840
that wasn't really interesting to me,

571
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,760
because what to me was really interesting

572
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,705
was the question that they asked is,

573
00:18:57,905 --> 00:18:58,840
they asked Democrats:

574
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,680
how do you now perceive

575
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,000
the Republicans across the table?

576
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,840
Republicans, how do you

577
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,720
perceive Democrats?

578
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,360
And across the table,

579
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,360
the two groups started seeing each other

580
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,844
as humans and started seeing each other

581
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,479
as a thoughtful human beings

582
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,378
and not as enemies

583
00:19:12,578 --> 00:19:14,560
that are trying to destroy their country.

584
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,400
And to me, that was very moving.

585
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,929
Unfortunately, we don't see it

586
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:19,000
at a large scale yet.

587
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,320
But they proved that

588
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,680
with what you're saying.

589
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,200
That's definitely something

590
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,360
that's extremely valuable.

591
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:25,600
Yeah.

592
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,440
I think that we all have to do that, right?

593
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,760
And not just in America.

594
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,040
I think every place is polarized.

595
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,200
Like you're from Israel.

596
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
I'm not going to blow up your spot,

597
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,619
but I'm sure you've had

598
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:35,729
some over the [--]

599
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,200
about the Israel and Palestinian conflict.

600
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,800
More than a few.

601
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,280
Right?

602
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,640
And just everywhere in the world.

603
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,928
And I think that we have to really

604
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,170
just come from this place of less of defense

605
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,880
and more of why do you feel that way.

606
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,760
Because when you come from

607
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,640
why do you feel that way,

608
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,320
and then I see you as a human,

609
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,045
then I'm opting into maybe

610
00:19:53,245 --> 00:19:55,907
not necessarily agreeing with you,

611
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:57,160
but figuring out

612
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,000
how can we come to a middle ground.

613
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,200
Right?

614
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,492
I always tell people

615
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:04,214
I am only polarized on issues

616
00:20:04,414 --> 00:20:08,080
that literally affect my humanity. Right?

617
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,747
If you believe that I should not be a citizen,

618
00:20:10,947 --> 00:20:11,883
that's going to be,

619
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,840
like there is no middle ground for that one.

620
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
If you believe that I should not be alive,

621
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,720
there is no middle ground for that one.

622
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,720
If you believe that I should be considered

623
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,083
a secondary human,

624
00:20:21,283 --> 00:20:22,920
there's no middle ground for that one.

625
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,680
But other than that,

626
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,120
we can make a lot of work you all.

627
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,880
We can make a lot work.

628
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,040
But yeah.

629
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,596
The only thing that I can wish for us

630
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,400
and everybody else across the country

631
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,979
that going into this turmoil

632
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:37,522
of a few months is not even going to be

633
00:20:37,722 --> 00:20:39,840
as is to have no proper discussions

634
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,520
and peaceful discussions.

635
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
That's the one hope I have

636
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,480
coming out of this election.

637
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,960
I don't know how feasible it is.

638
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,945
I think it's going to heavily depend on

639
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,320
on where the election goes.

640
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,480
But we can all hope

641
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,160
to have a little bit more humanity.

642
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,760
That's what I'm taking

643
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,760
out of this conversation.

644
00:20:53,761 --> 00:20:55,587
Alexandria, I want to thank you again so much

645
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:56,480
for being on the show.

646
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,473
I had so many questions

647
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,720
I wanted to ask you about your different roles

648
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,280
at Twitter, Airbnb and Facebook.

649
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,160
But, the things that you're talking about here,

650
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,714
I think are so critical

651
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:08,046
and so incredibly important right now

652
00:21:08,246 --> 00:21:08,970
for when we are.

653
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,600
So, thank you for sharing with me

654
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,160
your insights and the amazing

655
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,840
work that you've done.

656
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,677
Before we leave,

657
00:21:13,877 --> 00:21:14,915
I have to ask for three words

658
00:21:15,115 --> 00:21:16,840
that you would use to describe yourself.

659
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,800
The hardest question ever.

660
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,907
Okay, so my first word is actually a phrase.

661
00:21:20,107 --> 00:21:21,200
I'm proud to be freedom fighter.

662
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,960
My second word would probably

663
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,720
be accepting.

664
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,280
My third word would probably be curious.

665
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,536
I think all of those three things

666
00:21:33,736 --> 00:21:34,951
when you put them all together

667
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:36,424
really encompasses who I am

668
00:21:36,624 --> 00:21:37,625
and my professional

669
00:21:37,825 --> 00:21:39,040
and my personal life, right?

670
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,928
Yeah, I want to know more about you,

671
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:42,914
about people and, yeah.

672
00:21:43,114 --> 00:21:43,600
I love it.

673
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,800
Thank you so, so much.

674
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,720
This is great.

675
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,800
And thank you for being on the show.

676
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,400
Thank you.
