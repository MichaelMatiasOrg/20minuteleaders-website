1
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,560
All right.
Izhar.

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,280
Thank you for being with us.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,960
Thank you for being my kind host

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,960
overseas this evening.

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,000
Of course, of course.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,080
Twelve thousand kilometers

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,800
Not keeping us apart, even in times of
Corona.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,680
Absolutely.

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,600
So, Parliament member and former VC
.

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,240
and a CEO and entrepreneur

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,120
and social entrepreneur and all around,
incredible leader.

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,880
One of the best that I know.

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,560
It's not going to do justice if we even
start to talk a bit

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,120
about about what you did.

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,040
Can you can you share a little bit about
some of the things that

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,840
you've done over the past several
dozen years

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,620
and some of the things that excite you?

19
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,040
Oh, well

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,160
You know, I started my career as a

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,680
as an electronics engineer and then
moved on to all kinds of capacities.

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,760
I think that my most exciting times

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,680
were spent as an entrepreneur.

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,400
I enjoyed very much taking ideas into

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,920
products, into customers' hands

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,960
into building a business around them.

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,640
Which I did a number of times.

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,600
Two of them were with the
venture backed companies

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,640
that I had the privilege of running.

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,080
Both of them realized successful
exits for investors

31
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
but that was not the main issue.

32
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,880
the main point was really

33
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,840
seeing your product in the hands
of customers

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,400
and positively influencing people
around the world

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,560
which was a lot of excitement,
a lot of fun

36
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,560
and, you know, self rewarding

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,040
in terms of satisfaction and pride

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,560
You know, all those things

39
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,520
that I guess motivate us as individuals

40
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,560
and so I did that

41
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,200
And then I joined a venture capital firm

42
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,640
in the US called Canaan Partners

43
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,200
I was one of a team of

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,240
10 people most times where we invested
in companies,

45
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,200
mostly in the US, but also in
Israel and in India

46
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,080
and that was exciting as well, this time

47
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,840
taking a backseat as a board member,
as an investor

48
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,840
hopefully sometimes as a
value add investor

49
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,760
I had a lot of fun

50
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,520
And this was also rewarding in the sense of

51
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,560
having the chance

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,400
of working with very talented, bright

53
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,680
people around the world on bringing

54
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,320
their ideas into markets

55
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,620
influencing positively
people around the world

56
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,480
which is again, a lot of fun,
a lot of satisfaction

57
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,000
and you know, it was also

58
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,760
an educating journey just because you
meet with so many bright people

59
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,600
with so many great ideas.

60
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,480
and only you can join some of them
on the journey

61
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,720
that was very exciting as well

62
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:19,440
so I did all kinds of interesting things,
I guess, the last year plus as wel

63
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,680
we can speak about it
as well if you want

64
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,160
so interesting things,
I think that's putting it a little bit mildly

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,560
and we'll get to that.

66
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,240
but as of last year,

67
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,440
you're a Knesset member
and you're now serving the public

68
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,980
serving Israel and you're influencing
and in ways

69
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,840
that are very different from the way an
entrepreneur or a venture capitalist can

70
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,560
and it sounds like a pretty interesting
transition, moving

71
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,120
from high tech, very agile,

72
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,080
move fast and break things

73
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,840
very capitalistic to all of a sudden

74
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,520
serving the public and bringing up
bringing the social good in mind

75
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,840
so why? why at age 55 are you
now standing in the Knesset

76
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,240
and fighting for the good of
the Israeli citizens?

77
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,000
well, you know, one day when
I have the time to

78
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,460
sit down and write my memories,
I'll have to go back to this

79
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,440
specific question and try
to answer it properly

80
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,000
at this time, I can only offer thoughts,

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,280
you know, because this is an
ongoing process

82
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,840
I am more than a year into this

83
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,680
it kind of happened all of a sudden,
although I had been

84
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,840
so to speak, in public service
for quite some time

85
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,480
you know, as a volunteer

86
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,960
yes, a venture capitalist

87
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,560
but that aside, as a volunteer

88
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,760
I ran a not for profit organization that

89
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,680
dealt with and still is dealing now

90
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,480
without me, but dealt with the

91
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,720
youth around the country here in Israel
coming from challenging

92
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,880
socio-economic backgrounds

93
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,840
so those young adults were

94
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,720
under the great

95
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,360
support and care of our

96
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,680
volunteers around the country

97
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,880
so I did start for more than 10 years

98
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,720
very hard as a volunteer

99
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,280
on integrating various people

100
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,000
into the Israeli high-tech

101
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,200
you worked with the Haredis as well, right?

102
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,160
say that again

103
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,280
you worked with the Haredis as well, quite a bit

104
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,080
So, yeah.

105
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,640
So my point was trying to

106
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,320
integrate people who
come from communities

107
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,760
which are not necessarily
integrated properly

108
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,360
into the Israeli high-tech,

109
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,760
integrating those people into their high
tech bubble served

110
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,800
two main causes

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,320
one of them is just giving them equal

112
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,240
opportunities and providing

113
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,800
them with the appropriate

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,440
platform to go about their desires and

115
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,080
so improving their economics

116
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,600
but also there was also a bigger cause,
which was

117
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,040
this is important for the Israeli society

118
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,800
you know, bringing people together from
different communities,

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,520
different backgrounds is something
that we are missing badly over here

120
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,320
so I did that,
and then

121
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,080
so, at a certain point

122
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,920
and juncture, I came across

123
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,920
this opportunity of joining the
political life

124
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,200
which was a very tough decision

125
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,400
leaving all those exciting, interesting
and fun lifestyles

126
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,520
and and just to, you know, way of

127
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,960
going about life

128
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,200
that was a lot of fun and
very rewarding personally

129
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,840
and also, you know, the kind of life I

130
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,160
think I would be happy to go back one
day, 20, 30 years from now

131
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,760
so I had to leave all of these behind me
and join the political arena

132
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,520
but I think that they did it
because I understood

133
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,440
that what I did as a volunteer can scale
up in a significant way

134
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,640
If I am willing to take the
responsibility

135
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,440
and willing to  take
upon the challenge

136
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,920
and turn my life completely upside down

137
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,640
from a private entrepreneur

138
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,760
and venture capital to becoming
a public figure

139
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,880
that's a hell of a change

140
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,320
I did this and here I am

141
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,720
I mean, you took you took a really
non-traditional approach

142
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,240
I mean, a lot of politicians, they
started in

143
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,880
politics from a very, very
junior position

144
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,760
and then their dream is to even

145
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,160
hopefully one day become close to being
a Knesset member

146
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,120
and you really jumped into the ship of
some really,

147
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,240
really amazing people

148
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,640
and over a year fought really for democracy
as the main stance more than anything

149
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,560
and now you're talking about

150
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,800
the high tech technology within
government now

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,720
those two things don't make sense to me

152
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,880
I mean, when you think of
government, at least

153
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,000
I guess up until my generation and a bit
beyond, you

154
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,560
think of slow moving, you think of
bureaucracy.

155
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,360
you think of it's all about the budget
for this and budget for that

156
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,080
and now you're coming in and saying,
let's do it high tech

157
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,600
what does that mean?
can governments be agile?

158
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,240
can governments pivot when they need to?

159
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,560
wow, you nailed this Michael, right to the point

160
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,080
so, you know, it is a huge challenge

161
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,280
governments are slow, very bureaucratic

162
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,720
huge operations in many cases

163
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,320
unnecessarily big

164
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,880
and with so many processes that

165
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,320
kind of go against innovation,
against agile approaches to anything

166
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,840
and then you go into this and say, I'm
going to introduce change

167
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,920
so, yes, it is a huge challenge,
but it is part of the transformation

168
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,720
any nation with

169
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,920
emphasis on, democratic nations, they
have to go through

170
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,360
so, you know, technology has taken

171
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,120
the world has taken the world
through a

172
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,280
significant breakthrough

173
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,320
and we have all seen a leap forward

174
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,840
of changing the way we run our lives

175
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,720
personally on the business side, on the
community side

176
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,920
everywhere around us, governments are still
way behind and very slow to respond

177
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,960
but governments who want to

178
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,200
to survive have to go through that
transition

179
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,720
you know, your generation will not be
willing to accept

180
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,360
a government that slows down your
personal developmental

181
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,200
your desires, your willingness

182
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,920
to do stuff quickly and efficiently

183
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,560
it's a way of life, right

184
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,840
so here is a huge challenge

185
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,040
I think that I am in a good position to

186
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,960
realize that the need is there,

187
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,160
that it is a critical need, and we have
to start that transition

188
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,800
so, you know, I think that

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,520
other people already started this
transition not only in

190
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,560
Israel, but in other democracies like in
the US and elsewhere

191
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,360
there's a lot to be done

192
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,920
and I think that we are

193
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,240
here in Israel in a position,
in a good position

194
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,000
to try to push things forward,
because we are a startup nation

195
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,040
because there are
so many technologies,

196
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,520
breakthrough technologies that are being
developed here

197
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,000
and because we are a small country overall,

198
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,600
the positive noise, the positive
technology

199
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,360
and innovation noise has gone across
just the high tech community

200
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,160
so many people around the country,
some of them

201
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,600
understand the notion of innovation

202
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,200
and they also grew, too,

203
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,960
to know, to demand better from the
government

204
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,520
just because they see things managed

205
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,680
differently elsewhere

206
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,880
and so this is the some sort of a
turning point

207
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,720
where people around

208
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,480
the country realized that

209
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,680
a change is needed, a change is
possible,

210
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,360
and we, the politicians,

211
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,120
have the duty of introducing those
changes

212
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,720
so let me give you a number of examples

213
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,320
we want to provide a

214
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,880
a much better efficient

215
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,320
service to the public.

216
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,840
most of the service where the

217
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,940
government faces the public in Israel
and by the way, elsewhere as well

218
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,630
still requires many face to face interactions

219
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,960
many paper based interactions and

220
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,880
and sort of old world ways
of running your business

221
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,800
so, you know, my vision is hopefully

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,720
a number of years from now by law,

223
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,960
all Israeli government offices

224
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,680
and authorities will be required

225
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,280
to have an electronic interface with

226
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,000
anybody who requires

227
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,520
so, you know, I have my parents

228
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,480
they're 80 plus years old

229
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,200
they want to interface person to person,

230
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,120
and that's totally fine

231
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,640
but your generation, you know, you

232
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,040
would probably find it hard to believe
that you need to go somewhere

233
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,800
you need to file a paper, you need to
interface with a clerk

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,840
It's really unacceptable

235
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,920
and there's no reason for that

236
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,640
so we have to go through that transition

237
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,440
I should say that a number of Israeli

238
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,120
officers, Israeli governmental officers,
have started to go through that transition

239
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,480
But still, there is a long way to go

240
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,640
luckily, again, we are startup nation.
there are so many technology,

241
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,720
so many products that
have been developed

242
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,240
over here to improve the
efficiency of processes

243
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,000
to provide better service to customers

244
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,280
to manage all kinds of processes
in a much better way

245
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,600
so all of this, interesting enough,
is being sold outside of Israel just

246
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,440
because Israeli entrepreneurs do not
want to deal with the government

247
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
rightfully so,
I was an entrepreneur

248
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,720
I have scars of trying to sell to the
Israeli government

249
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,200
so I know what it takes

250
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,600
but if you just improve that facet of the
government,

251
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,160
you suddenly see the Israeli

252
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,800
municipalities taking advantage of so

253
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,560
many smart cities technologies that
have been developed in Israel

254
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,800
but are sold exclusively elsewhere
out of the country

255
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,480
you see so many technologies
that can improve

256
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,880
the efficiency, the productivity,
the security

257
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,400
of government agencies sold elsewhere

258
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,320
that can be integrated into our

259
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,560
government over here

260
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,720
so that's an example

261
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,240
And I just touched upon kind of the
surface

262
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,480
this is a trivial transition

263
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,560
you know, going paperless, going
electronically

264
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,440
and so on, but there are so many other

265
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,520
layers that one could think about

266
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,800
and we have so many good ideas
that, you know,

267
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,120
I could spend the next 20 years or
more integrating

268
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,080
interesting ideas that will be a lot of fun

269
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,040
venture capitalists, you're sitting

270
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,720
and I have the
privilege now

271
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,920
of experiencing a little taste of it
here in Silicon Valley

272
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,320
and, you know, you're sitting there and
you're trying to

273
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,080
think of a business proposition

274
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,400
an opportunity to change consumer
behavior, to improve the lives of many

275
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,400
and then you're sitting on your side of
the table as the venture capitalist

276
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,380
and trying to think, is this viable?

277
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,400
and I grow this into a scalable business

278
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,520
that will actually bring value to people?

279
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,040
and I can't help but make the
comparison that

280
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,720
sitting in the position that you
are now, you're seeing

281
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,840
all these propositions all the time

282
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,480
do you find yourself ever putting on this

283
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,360
venture capitalist hat and trying to assess

284
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,120
whether if this was a startup that came
and proposed

285
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,720
whether I believe this entrepreneur

286
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,480
whether I believe this model that they're
suggesting

287
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,240
oh, absolutely

288
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,360
let me give you an example, Michael

289
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,560
it's an interesting analogy

290
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,000
you know, here's something I learned

291
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,520
every parliament member is actually some
sort of a PNL unit

292
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,080
so really, you know, here in Israel, we

293
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,780
have 120 parliament members

294
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,320
each of whom makes decisions

295
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,920
as to what to focus on and what to
invest their time in

296
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,360
and there are many opportunities to
advance all kinds of laws

297
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,400
all kinds of public services

298
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,200
and one has to focus

299
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,320
one has to decide what is their specific

300
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,360
advantage, what are their desires

301
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,160
and what is that you really
want to promote?

302
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,240
you know, every day, every day,
as a public servant,

303
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,800
I get approached by many people
who rightfully so

304
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,680
have all kinds of interesting ideas

305
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,600
all kinds of desires or
all kinds of problems

306
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,280
and you have to make that decision

307
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,160
you have to make the decision of,

308
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,160
you know,

309
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,080
I want to focus on certain areas

310
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,520
I'm going to specialize in those areas

311
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,520
I want to provide service to
certain constituents

312
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,240
and by doing this, by the way, I realized

313
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,240
that I give up others

314
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,640
so it's not an easy decision

315
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,360
pretty much the same way venture
capitalists work,

316
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,040
you know, as a VC partner

317
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,160
I would see about 1000 opportunities
every year

318
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,920
obviously, as you know, I would have not
been able to

319
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,320
deal with even 1 percent of them

320
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,200
and if I did two to three deals a year,

321
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,480
I would feel pretty good about it


322
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:33,840
same here

323
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,920
you know, just to give you a sense

324
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,400
the previous full term Knesset

325
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,640
that worked in Israel was the
20th Knesset

326
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,080
it worked for about four years

327
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,040
and it was able to

328
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,720
to put together about 400
plus laws, you know, in Israel

329
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,560
but the number of law proposals

330
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,200
that were submitted were about 6000 law

331
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,200
proposals from the get go

332
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,920
so here's your ratio

333
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,480
if you think about this, about 6000 law
proposals that were filtered in

334
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,600
not by VCs, but by Knesset members

335
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,880
so each of those basic members
probably looked at

336
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,360
at least 3 to 5 times that number

337
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,520
and they decided to narrow down to about
6000 law proposals

338
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,520
and four years later, you see that
about 400.

339
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,120
so I'll say like 7-8% of them
were really transacted

340
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,360
so this is like taking the VC approach
and understanding it and

341
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,760
then kind of mapping it to what
the process looks like in my life today

342
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,320
and frankly, my life as a VC is helpful here

343
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,360
I learned to prioritize, to understand
where my added value stands and

344
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,200
to force myself to focus while realizing

345
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,560
that I may be giving up other
opportunities as well

346
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,360
and you probably can't say it yourself,

347
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,880
but honestly, it probably is from
the VC perspective

348
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,720
you also know sometimes to cut the
bullshit and to

349
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,240
and to get to the point and know some of
the things that go behind

350
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,240
what's actually behind the
PowerPoint presentation

351
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,960
and I'm sure that that gives a lot
of value as well

352
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,540
I can give you
an interesting example

353
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,240
of how all this combines, if you want

354
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,240
yeah, of course

355
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,960
so, you know, these are corona times,
corona virus times, I should say

356
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,480
and one of the things we are, one of the big
challenges we are facing as

357
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,080
the parliament here in Israel is the

358
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,040
significant, realistic, fear that
sometime over the next

359
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,360
few days or few weeks,

360
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,120
we may find many of us,
parliament members

361
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,000
out of the Knesset, out of the parliament

362
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,240
either being instructed to stay home
because we were close

363
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,840
to somebody who was infected
or one or some,

364
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,520
some of us may be infected themselves

365
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,480
so here is the challenge

366
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,360
the Israeli parliament by

367
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,880
a very significant law

368
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,560
we call them foundation laws

369
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,400
this is like the constitution translated
into Israeli terms

370
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,760
we do not have a constitution here, but
we have

371
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,480
basic laws that kind of control the way

372
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,920
we govern our democracy

373
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,360
one of these laws dictates that

374
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,520
any discussion and voting

375
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,680
must take in person in the Knesset

376
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,240
if you are not in the Knesset, you are
not allowed to vote

377
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,720
you are not allowed to be part of
the discussion

378
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,360
and interestingly enough, throughout

379
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,400
the 72 years of the Israeli parliament,

380
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,680
there was never a session that was

381
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,600
prevented from being

382
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,200
handled because of anything

383
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,960
so you know, sometimes

384
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,400
there used to be emergency cases

385
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,800
you know, we were attacked here and
there

386
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,400
so we stopped for 24 hours, but you
continue the

387
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,800
discussion and the voting process so
that democracy continues to run

388
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,740
but nobody ever thought that you may find
a situation where

389
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,360
people cannot go in person to do this

390
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,240
and by the way, we have provisions of
substituting

391
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,760
the Knesset building into some other

392
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
building, there are
all kinds of backup buildings

393
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,600
so, gathering is possible

394
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,200
but the notion of doing this
electronically

395
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,240
was never considered

396
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,000
not for technology reasons, but just for

397
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,280
you could call this basic democracy

398
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,760
you want to see the person in person

399
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,360
so I used my experience and submitted an

400
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,760
urgent law proposal to the Knesset

401
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,640
where we are kind of running
against time

402
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,480
you know, it takes time to process law

403
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,720
sometimes it takes two to three years

404
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,160
sometimes it takes a few months

405
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,360
it rarely takes a few days but we're
running against time

406
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,880
and so the clock is ticking

407
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,520
we submitted a law proposal this week,
and we hope to be able to bring it up to

408
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:57,000
discussion on Monday, next week
which is a record breaking pace

409
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,640
and that law will allow for a limited

410
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,640
amount of time and for very specific

411
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,360
cases, which are people that
have to be isolated

412
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,560
by the orders of the ministry of health,

413
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,440
or they have been infected

414
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,040
but they will be allowed to log in

415
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,560
electronically and they will be allowed to

416
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,200
discuss and to vote, which is a very
significant precedence

417
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,040
we have to go through all the motions,
we sat with top lawyers here in Israel

418
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,240
constitutional lawyers and others

419
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,640
and we have come up with the right
formula that kind of satisfies everybody

420
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,200
and now we are running
against time

421
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,800
the real fear is that we will not

422
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,360
have enough people to vote

423
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,960
on submitting and for an approach in

424
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,640
approving this law before people are
being isolated

425
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,640
so here's a combination of everything

426
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,300
you have the VC guy, the technology guy and
the parliament member

427
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,320
who are trying to put all of
this together

428
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,960
very, very fascinating
wow, best of luck

430
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,920
I mean, that's just inspiring to hear
from my end

431
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,040
Izhar, you have to go back to
running the country

432
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,240
but three words that describe you

433
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,600
wow

434
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,360
dreamier, optimistic, passionate.

435
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,680
I love it
Izhar thank you so, so much

436
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,920
Loved having you here

437
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,060
take good care of yourself, please

438
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,280
take care
stay healthy

439
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,040
bye bye
