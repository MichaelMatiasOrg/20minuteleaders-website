1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,960
You have to be fast at hiring people,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,680
you have to be fast

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,840
in making decisions,

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,760
you have to be fast

5
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,000
in executing on your marketing

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,880
in executing on your product releases.

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,640
You have to match

8
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,200
your actions with your strategy.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,720
Mike Cassidy, thank you

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,200
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,680
How are you?

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,480
Good. How are you?

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,040
It is such an honor and privilege

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,640
to have you here.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,200
Thank you so much for joining me.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,600
I know how incredibly busy you are

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,240
and I really appreciate it.

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,280
I'm excited to talk to you

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,200
these 20 minutes

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,400
about really your journey

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,880
and your outlook on startups,

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,920
on deep technology,

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,440
on making an impact.

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,160
Mike, besides the fact that

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,280
you are a VP at Google

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,640
and ran Project Loon,

27
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,320
which is one of my all time favorite

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,520
tech projects I've ever seen

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,400
with trying to provide Internet

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,960
to billions of people through balloons.

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
You were also serial entrepreneur

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,920
with multiple startups behind you.

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,040
I believe one of them started with a $500

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,520
that you and your co-founders put in.

35
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,360
So, I'd love to hear that story.

36
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,680
And today you're running Apollo Fusion,

37
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,480
which I can't wait

38
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,040
to hear about what it is.

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,400
But, Mike, let's get started

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,200
with real passion,

41
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,120
which is the fact

42
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,560
that you've released two jazz albums.

43
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,440
How does that work with all

44
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,840
with everything else that I was saying?

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,840
So, I love a change of pace.

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,320
And when I do startups

47
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,080
between the startups,

48
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,360
I try to do something fun.

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,640
And for one year, between startups,

50
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,247
I was an entrepreneur in residence

51
00:02:00,248 --> 00:02:01,320
at Benchmark.

52
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,000
But a different year,

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,320
I went to Berklee College of Music.

54
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:05,960
And when I was there,

55
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,880
I studied jazz piano

56
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,800
and studied what it takes

57
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,480
to record and produce records.

58
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,160
And so, I had fun doing that.

59
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:18,360
Wow. Unbelievable.

60
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,920
What is it about jazz

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,400
that excites you?

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,920
And I have to ask this question because

63
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,240
I've already met multiple

64
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,960
really, really incredible people

65
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,200
from the techs that are just

66
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,440
really love jazz,

67
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,920
my father being one of them.

68
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,160
So, what is it about jazz

69
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,040
that really excites you?

70
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,960
I mean,

71
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,960
the improvisation part is really fun,

72
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,520
I think, so, it's not like

73
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,000
the same tone all the time.

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,280
When you get into the improve section,

75
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,840
you're hearing something new every time.

76
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,520
And the act of improvisation I think is,

77
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,600
it's a great challenge.

78
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,960
You've got the chords

79
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,480
and then, real time,

80
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,840
you're trying to make up a melody

81
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,960
that fits with the chords

82
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,680
and fits in with what the people

83
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,360
around you are playing.

84
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,800
It's also kind of a camaraderie

85
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,120
to jazz playing in a combo

86
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,840
that there is in a startup.

87
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,200
You're listening

88
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,920
to what every person

89
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,280
in the combo is doing

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,800
and you're playing off them

91
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,680
and they're playing off you.

92
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,280
And it's very fun for me.

93
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,120
I love it. And I think one

94
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,720
of the first things

95
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,120
that I was always inspired about jazz

96
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,040
is when I started playing saxophone

97
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,680
very young was the idea that

98
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,400
you have this both the harmony

99
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,920
at one point

100
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,720
where everybody's playing together.

101
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,440
But then at some point,

102
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,720
you're also giving

103
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,600
the stage to individual people

104
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,080
to showcase their creativity

105
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,600
and you're supporting them

106
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,640
and you're continuing to play

107
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,400
but consciously supporting them

108
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
so that they are the forefront

109
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,040
and giving them that chance.

110
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,760
I think that's just wonderful.

111
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,280
Mike, take me back to the young days.

112
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,880
Studying aerospace engineering at MIT,

113
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,800
going then to Harvard, I believe.

114
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,560
But what is the trajectory

115
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,840
that you hope for yourself along the way?

116
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,120
What do you imagine yourself

117
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,560
doing later on in life?

118
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,000
Well, in the beginning,

119
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,760
I wanted to be an astronaut.

120
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,360
But it doesn't really worked out.

121
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,520
Yes.

122
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,640
But for the next best thing was,

123
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,200
I guess, being an aerospace engineer

124
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,680
and I love being an aerospace engineer.

125
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,280
And I started off at this place

126
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,960
it was an aircraft company working on

127
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,840
satellites and launch vehicles

128
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,800
and a solar powered race car.

129
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,720
But part of that process was me

130
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,320
kind of feeling like

131
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,960
through the aerospace industry,

132
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,840
in those days at least,

133
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
was very big

134
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,000
and not the fastest moving

135
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,480
and it didn't feel like

136
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,120
you could have

137
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,720
a huge impact personally on like

138
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,480
starting up a startup

139
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,320
that would then turn into a big company

140
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,960
in the aerospace industry.

141
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,280
So, I kind of wanted to do a startup

142
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,360
in a different industry where

143
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,680
a company could get a lot of traction

144
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,000
and move a lot faster.

145
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,240
I mean, you're talking about

146
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,640
how speed and about

147
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,000
the pace of the industry,

148
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,320
which resonates interestingly.

149
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,480
I'd love to talk soon about speed

150
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,960
as the primary business strategy

151
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,880
that you talked about.

152
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,320
But take me to the days of Stylus.

153
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:07,920
You're starting out

154
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,640
with your co-founders,

155
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,400
you're putting in $500 each,

156
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,440
a company that takes off pretty quickly.

157
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,720
What was that journey like?

158
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,880
Give me a little bit

159
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,560
of the back end story.

160
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,400
Yeah.

161
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,120
So, we're definitely capital constrained,

162
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,800
that's for sure.

163
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,880
We had $1500 plus

164
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,560
we won the MIT Business Plan competition,

165
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,000
which was a $10,000 price,

166
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,640
so we had $11,500.

167
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,120
And it really forced us to be,

168
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,680
necessity is the mother of invention.

169
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:42,440
I mean every step of the way

170
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,040
we'd be super frugal, super careful.

171
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,920
And as we launched

172
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,760
this software product,

173
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,360
we literally every day on the wall,

174
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,000
we put how much profit did we make today.

175
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,920
We didn't put what our sales,

176
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,160
but how much profit we make.

177
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,240
And we sort of trained our whole company,

178
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,600
to focused on profit,

179
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,880
and then we would make a little rules

180
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,000
for ourselves, like, okay,

181
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,040
before we can hire a tech support person,

182
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,360
we need to have three weeks

183
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,520
where the total profit each week

184
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,080
is at least $10,000.

185
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,320
And then once that happened,

186
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,960
we now can hire tech support person.

187
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,840
And I think that discipline

188
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,000
helped the whole company focus

189
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,600
on the right things.

190
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,520
How do you focus on that discipline?

191
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,640
Because it sounds to me

192
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,120
from talking to

193
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
a lot of young entrepreneurs

194
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,280
and looking at myself,

195
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,760
that's one of the hardest things to do.

196
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,120
It's to have that bigger picture,

197
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,280
that vision,

198
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,040
overarching strategy of understanding

199
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,600
what it will take to continue growing.

200
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,000
Where do you get that discipline

201
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,320
at such an early time?

202
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,920
This is, I believe,

203
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,920
one of the first endeavors

204
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,960
that you run by yourself.

205
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,240
Right?

206
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,760
Well, I think it was

207
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,840
kind of forced on us.

208
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,560
I mean, we were like,

209
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,560
had to focus on the fundamentals.

210
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,520
You know, who is going to buy,

211
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,600
we had this idea for a piece of software

212
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,360
or software tool,

213
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,520
who is going to buy it.

214
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,840
We sort of figured

215
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,960
we had some ideas on that.

216
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,080
And then, what is our sort of

217
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,880
marketing distribution channel.

218
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,560
And it was very simple for us.

219
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,000
There was a computer chart in a Journal

220
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,760
of ONE magazine,

221
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,280
it was focused on computer telephony

222
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,960
and then there was something called

223
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,200
Visual Basic Programmer's Journal,

224
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,480
basically, a medium for people

225
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
who are using visual basic.

226
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,840
And our tool was a visual basic tool

227
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,760
to do a computer telephony.

228
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,360
So, we focused on those two channels

229
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,520
and we focused on like PR,

230
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,320
we got on the cover

231
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,160
of computer telephony magazine twice

232
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,400
over the course of about a year.

233
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,000
We focused on basic advertising.

234
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,440
We would take out a $1,000 ad

235
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,760
in one of these magazines

236
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,680
and we are going to see,

237
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,720
okay, we got $3,000 back.

238
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,000
Okay, maybe we can try $2,000 ad

239
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,480
and we get 9,000 back

240
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,920
and we just do the basics.

241
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,400
And it really it was the basics.

242
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,200
I love it. I love it.

243
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,240
And the next endeavor, Direct Hit.

244
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,440
500 days, $500M acquisition and obviously

245
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,320
it's not just about the money,

246
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,480
but it's also the impact.

247
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,160
But that makes me think a lot

248
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,880
about your presentation,

249
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,200
speed as the primary business strategy.

250
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,560
You're coming from an industry

251
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,680
where you're saying that, you know,

252
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,400
it's not necessarily moving the fastest.

253
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,520
You're an early young entrepreneur,

254
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,840
out of MIT and Harvard,

255
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,440
what is this thinking

256
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,040
process behind speed

257
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,520
as the primary business strategy?

258
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,600
What does that even mean to you?

259
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,240
Well, I think speed brings

260
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,720
a lot of advantages.

261
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,120
First of all, you can,

262
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,240
it's easier to attract people

263
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,280
to join your venture

264
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,200
when you can point to have faster moving.

265
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,080
Like one of the companies was,

266
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,200
it was an instant messenger

267
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,360
for PC video games.

268
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,960
And if we could say,

269
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,440
you know, in a month ago,

270
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,800
we gained in the past month,

271
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,600
you know, we gained

272
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,040
two million new users.

273
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,760
The month before that,

274
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,240
we gained a million new users.

275
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,480
That gets people to say, wow,

276
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,640
I want to join your company.

277
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,320
Or when you're raising money,

278
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,800
you can show those statistics,

279
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,600
it's easier to raise money.

280
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,480
When you are getting press to cover you,

281
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,160
it's easier to get

282
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,120
the press to cover you.

283
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,560
So, also, tougher for your

284
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,760
competition to keep up with you.

285
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,280
I mean we had competitors

286
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,040
who were releasing,

287
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:08,800
we are releasing

288
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,760
a new version of the product

289
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,120
basically every two weeks.

290
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,560
Every two weeks,

291
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,920
a new version would come out.

292
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,840
And some of our competitors

293
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,960
were releasing a new version

294
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,720
of their product every year.

295
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,000
So, it was much easier for us

296
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,840
at a two week cycle

297
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,520
to basically just destroy them

298
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,079
from a feature comparison standpoint.

299
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,896
What does that mean today?

300
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,840
Yeah, go ahead.

301
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,480
Well, so I think I mean,

302
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:33,200
I think the speed,

303
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,280
you know, brings a lot of advantages

304
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,360
from a competitive standpoint.

305
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:36,840
And then you just have

306
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,640
to execute in that in everything you do.

307
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,840
You have to be fast at hiring people.

308
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,720
You have to be fast in making decisions.

309
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,640
You have to be fast

310
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,560
in executing on your marketing,

311
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,760
executing on your product releases.

312
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,520
You have to match

313
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,240
your actions with your strategy.

314
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,600
Right. So, you're really looking

315
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,240
at speed as a strategy

316
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,920
and not just as an advantage,

317
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,560
but actually something that

318
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,720
the leadership of a company should

319
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,960
put forward as one of their

320
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,960
key motivations in their day to day.

321
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,160
Right?

322
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,320
And because it all comes down

323
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,320
to culture and how everybody is aligned

324
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,680
towards what are the milestones.

325
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,160
I'm seeing it now within

326
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,400
a very fast growing company, Hippo,

327
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,080
how we're all feeling the pace

328
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,720
and everybody's aligned towards

329
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,560
this amazing mission

330
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,000
and we know that every day counts,

331
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,960
which is really incredible.

332
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,040
Mike, I have to talk about Project Loon

333
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,720
because it's one of my favorite

334
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,840
all time projects.

335
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,560
I remember seeing the videos

336
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,240
of the balloons and just thinking about

337
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,400
how creative that is

338
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,160
and the impact that it can do.

339
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,480
You joined Google to help run it

340
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,680
but tell me a little bit about

341
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,880
the motivations behind Project Loon

342
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,520
and really all about what it takes

343
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,400
to run a moonshot idea like this.

344
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,440
Yeah. So, Loon was a very very fun,

345
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,880
crazy, challenging adventure.

346
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,680
When we started on it,

347
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,680
pretty much 95% of everyone heard of it,

348
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,920
thought it was never going to work,

349
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,680
and it was crazy.

350
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,800
We had to do a lot of things.

351
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,200
We have to basically shrink a cell tower

352
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,760
to be much, much lighter,

353
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,200
much smaller and much use

354
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,000
much less power,

355
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,720
because that's where basically

356
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,560
putting on a balloon.

357
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,560
We had to find ways

358
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,960
of steering the balloons

359
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,480
and people didn't think you could steer,

360
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,720
really, you know,

361
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,040
these balloons at 60,000 ft.

362
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,280
You didn't have a motor on it

363
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,880
to propel it around.

364
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,640
But in the stratosphere,

365
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,400
the wind direction is stratified.

366
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,320
So, at 61,000 ft.

367
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,920
the wind might be going

368
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,480
five miles an hour east

369
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,560
at 59,000 ft.

370
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,720
It might be going 12 miles an hour south.

371
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,360
So, by just going up and down

372
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,240
you can steer in north,

373
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,120
east, south and west.

374
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,960
And those little key tactical,

375
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,400
whatever design advantages eventually

376
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,680
got us the point where we could launch,

377
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,760
you know, a couple of dozen balloons

378
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,560
from Puerto Rico and two weeks later

379
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,040
having them hovering all over a spot of,

380
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,960
a few dozen square miles in Peru.

381
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,200
And so, it was just a series

382
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,720
of solving technical challenges.

383
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,320
I just love that and give me a little bit

384
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,800
of background as to why Project Loon

385
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,160
came about. So, obviously

386
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,320
we're talking about accessibility,

387
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,560
we're talking about a creative way

388
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,320
to provide accessibility

389
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,760
for places in the world.

390
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,360
Can you give me a little bit of context

391
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,480
as to how many people still are not

392
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,960
don't have access to Internet?

393
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,560
Why does Google X put so many resources

394
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,240
into this crazy creative project?

395
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,720
Yeah.

396
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,000
So, you know, when we're starting

397
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,800
something on the order

398
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,040
of half of the people in the world

399
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,640
didn't have Internet access.

400
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,960
When you go to Africa,

401
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,440
there's a billion people in Africa,

402
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,120
only 100 million had Internet access.

403
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,160
Even when we were starting

404
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,040
even in India, over a billion people,

405
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,200
only about a hundred million

406
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,080
had Internet access.

407
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,760
So, there were lots and lots of people

408
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,640
who didn't have access.

409
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,920
And some of it was very straightforward.

410
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,720
In the more urban areas,

411
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,680
there were cell towers

412
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,040
and it was cost effective

413
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,240
for the telephone companies

414
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,280
to build cell towers.

415
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,080
But a lot of times

416
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,520
in the more rural areas,

417
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,080
it was not cost effective

418
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,240
and a lot of people in the rural areas

419
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,200
just didn't have cell towers.

420
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,360
So, that was kind of the thinking.

421
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,040
And then, of course, all the things,

422
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,760
all the benefits the Internet brings,

423
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,600
you know, weather reports and education

424
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,280
and medical information and commerce.

425
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,040
So, that was kind of the driver

426
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,680
behind the idea.

427
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,080
That's incredible. And now,

428
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,840
you're coming in to Project Loon,

429
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,760
you've had, I believe,

430
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,640
four startups behind you working

431
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,200
in other companies previously,

432
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,840
and now you're running a team

433
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,200
that it's not really clear whether

434
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
this is going to succeed.

435
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,360
There is no crazy,

436
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,320
there is no profit at the end of the day

437
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,440
that you're marking on the border

438
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,640
to know your growth.

439
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,400
You're really solving

440
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,480
a huge technical problem

441
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,080
that at the end

442
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,120
could potentially impact

443
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,880
billions of people.

444
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,360
What is the leadership mindset

445
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,560
that you have to take into this

446
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,760
that is perhaps either different

447
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,080
or similar to your previous endeavors?

448
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,280
Well, I mean, I still believe that,

449
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,360
that moving very quickly was

450
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,640
the right strategy for Loon.

451
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,840
I mean, there's competition in the world.

452
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,280
I mean, you can just look around today,

453
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,720
you see multiple satellite

454
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,440
constellations,

455
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,280
you know, SpaceX's Starlink,

456
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,960
you know, OneWeb,

457
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,680
Tesla has announced one,

458
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,760
Amazon has announced one.

459
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,360
So yeah.

460
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,560
They're trying to do some of the things,

461
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,680
bring Internet to many people.

462
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,480
So, you have got to move

463
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,840
to beat the competition.

464
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,080
But also, you've got to move quickly

465
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,800
just to avoid

466
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,960
the project kind of petering out.

467
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,520
If it goes on too many years

468
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,400
without success, you know,

469
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,200
Google might decide

470
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,640
they don't want to continue to fund it.

471
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,680
People on the team might decide

472
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,520
it's not interesting enough

473
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,000
they might drift off the team.

474
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,440
So, I think there's still advantages

475
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,480
or necessity in many cases

476
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,080
to move in quickly,

477
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,120
even in a corporate

478
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,840
environment like that.

479
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:06,920
Right.

480
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,480
And in 2017, you go back to

481
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,240
to the entrepreneurial days,

482
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,440
creating a new venture, Apollo Fusion,

483
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,960
again in the aerospace field.

484
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,920
Why leave VP at Google,

485
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,680
a dream position that,

486
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,240
you know, millions of people want?

487
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,960
You've had these experiences before,

488
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,120
right?

489
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,920
You know what it's like

490
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
being an entrepreneur.

491
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,320
People say that you have to be crazy

492
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,440
to be an entrepreneur.

493
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,280
Why go and create a new venture?

494
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,320
I mean, I just love the camaraderie

495
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,680
of the startup environment.

496
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,440
I love the, you know, the small team.

497
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,040
We have 20 people now at Apollo Fusion.

498
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,080
I just love that sort of size.

499
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,400
And it's more what I'm used to.

500
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,960
It's sort of a small, small team company.

501
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,160
Yeah.

502
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,120
It's been more and more what I'm used to.

503
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,960
So, what's the mission,

504
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,920
because also Apollo Fusion

505
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,480
is trying to solve

506
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,400
some pretty incredible problems

507
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,920
that are extremely relevant to 2020,

508
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,840
especially what we've seen

509
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,800
with environmental changes?

510
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Yeah, it's very fun time

511
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,280
to be in the space business.

512
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,040
It's kind of like the second

513
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,240
space boom, space renaissance

514
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,880
or something like in the 60s,

515
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,400
we're very excited with the Apollo program

516
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,000
and a lot of attention focused on it.

517
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,280
I think, over a few decades,

518
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,600
the interest kind of died down

519
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,000
a little bit.

520
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,440
You know, the space

521
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,000
shuttle program ended.

522
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,200
Right.

523
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,640
Got to be kind of bogged down but,

524
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,960
some of the things you mentioned before,

525
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,120
like with SpaceX being able

526
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,080
to offer a much cheaper payload,

527
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,400
dollars per kilogram to orbit

528
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,720
with, you know,

529
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,440
using various cell phone type technology

530
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,640
to make small satellites.

531
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,440
You talk about

532
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,680
the inertial measurement

533
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,240
unit inside a cell phone.

534
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,360
You can use that on a satellite.

535
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,040
You can use the CPU from a cell phone,

536
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,120
you can use that on satellite.

537
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,560
So, you can drive

538
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,280
the cost of the satellites down,

539
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,000
the launch costs is going down,

540
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,960
and there's a lot of uses, right?

541
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,720
There's the Internet

542
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,040
bringing communication uses,

543
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,360
but there's also Earth observation.

544
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,080
A lot of people are interested in

545
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:14,280
using the satellites to track where

546
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,120
forests are getting burned

547
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,720
or there's illegal fishing going on.

548
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,560
You can detect climate change

549
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,080
and or from a, you know,

550
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,960
from a competitive standpoint,

551
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,560
you can measure

552
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,520
sort of what's going on

553
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,480
in the competitive landscape

554
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,160
and you can use that information

555
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,600
to make your company faster and better.

556
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:37,680
100%.

557
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,800
Mike, I have, you know,

558
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,560
going over this incredible journey.

559
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,840
Most of the people that are watching this

560
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,040
are young entrepreneurs,

561
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,640
young engineers that are excited

562
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,840
to go on their journey.

563
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
One of the things that I mention

564
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,200
that I'm incredibly inspired by

565
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,880
is solving really difficult problems

566
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
that have a huge impact,

567
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,760
potential huge impact later on.

568
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,680
What are some insights that you've gained

569
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,920
over the years that you would tell

570
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,840
either yourself as a young entrepreneur

571
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,440
or other young hungry entrepreneurs

572
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,840
that are just thinking about

573
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,960
how to get started?

574
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,000
What are some really main things

575
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,560
that you would keep in mind?

576
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,920
Yeah. So,

577
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,440
it was either Larry or Sergey

578
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,080
who once pointed out to me that,

579
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,840
all start ups are going to be very hard.

580
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,560
So, if they're all going be hard,

581
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,520
why don't you go after something big,

582
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,200
anyway, which at first I was like,

583
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,960
that's kind of crazy,

584
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,440
but I think it's kind of true.

585
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:30,640
Yeah.

586
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,800
I think I'm really a big fan of

587
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,760
focusing on

588
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,760
the right general industry to be in.

589
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,720
Like, in the 80s,

590
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,680
you want to be in personal computers.

591
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,360
You know, in the late 90s,

592
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:49,680
you want to be

593
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,040
an Internet type businesses.

594
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,976
Right now, you might want to be

595
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:52,640
in the space business

596
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
or you might want to be in, you know,

597
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,800
CRISPR or biotech

598
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,920
or something like that.

599
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,840
So, focus on the right space to be in.

600
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,760
You know, whatever is a rising tide

601
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,560
rises or ships or whatever.

602
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,520
But then also,

603
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,880
four out of the five companies I had

604
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,080
had to change direction

605
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,280
from the original idea.

606
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,800
So, maybe I'm not so good

607
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,480
at picking the first idea,

608
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,080
but putting together a really,

609
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,240
you know,

610
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,080
A plus team that can pivot quickly

611
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,480
and get in the right space, get started.

612
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,880
I'm always encouraging entrepreneurs,

613
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,520
get started,

614
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,040
get a good team together,

615
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,520
start out, put your whatever

616
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,560
your prototype out there,

617
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,320
and whatever you call it

618
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,800
the initial product, whatever,

619
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,160
put it out there and  get feedback, yeah.

620
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,000
Get feedback and then adjust.

621
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,320
And that happen four out of five times.

622
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,800
We got feedback saying,

623
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,320
that's the wrong direction.

624
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,880
But, by the way,

625
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,080
near what you're doing

626
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,440
is something that's

627
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,120
much more interesting.

628
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,040
So, shift over to that near thing.

629
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,320
So yeah,

630
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,440
I definitely encourage entrepreneurs

631
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
to do that.

632
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,800
100%. I love the mentality,

633
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,480
I see quite a few people that are

634
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,040
get so excited about this idea

635
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,360
that they do get an A plus team,

636
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,720
but then they run off for about a year,

637
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,680
year and a half perfecting that idea,

638
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,640
only to realize that

639
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,320
there are some really dramatic pivots

640
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,200
because they never had

641
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,840
any initial validation.

642
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,120
But by providing this, you know,

643
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,920
50% MVP to the world

644
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,520
and prototyping just to see reactions

645
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,960
and pivoting quickly,

646
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,080
saves so much time

647
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,160
and obviously capital.

648
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,560
Mike, thank you so much for being here.

649
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,640
This is so great to have you

650
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,520
and thank you for being

651
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,840
generous with your time.

652
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Before we leave,

653
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,360
I have to ask

654
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,880
the most important question,

655
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,280
which is three words

656
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,640
that you would use to describe yourself.

657
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,680
Okay, number one is tenacious.

658
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,560
I think it was

659
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,400
Thomas Edison, who said,

660
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,360
if you are faced with failure

661
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,160
again and again,

662
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,480
what's the surest way to succeed

663
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,720
is to always be willing

664
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,040
to try just one more time.

665
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,720
And it seems like a little

666
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,800
whatever, a little simple thing.

667
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
But if you think about it,

668
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,200
it's kind of true, right?

669
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,320
I mean, if you're always

670
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,560
being willing to try it

671
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,480
just one more time,

672
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,800
then you'll never, by definition, fail.

673
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,600
The second one, I guess,

674
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,000
would be optimistic.

675
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,200
I mean,

676
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,440
I think other people have said this.

677
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,960
I think it's a very characteristic trait

678
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
of entrepreneurs that

679
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,720
they're irrationally optimistic.

680
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,425
I think I'm definitely

681
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:26,600
irrational optimistic.

682
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,600
But, you know,

683
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,640
you kind of need that

684
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,520
to be an entrepreneur.

685
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,040
100%.

686
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,400
Yeah, that's good.

687
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,480
And then the last one,

688
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,160
I think maybe open.

689
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,080
I'm very open at the company.

690
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,040
I tell the team

691
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,280
when things are going great

692
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,800
and when they're not going great,

693
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,480
but at least that way they believe me.

694
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,080
I think it's a bad CEO trait

695
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,680
to always be saying

696
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,280
everything's great

697
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,640
when no one believes you.

698
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,960
So, you've got to be open

699
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,680
and tell people what's going on.

700
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,760
Mike, thank you very, very much.

701
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,240
This was phenomenal.

702
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,560
I can't wait

703
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,240
to follow Apollo Fusion some more.

704
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,720
And stay safe and stay healthy.

705
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,800
Thank you for having me

706
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,480
and say hi to your dad for me.

707
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,360
Okay, bye bye.
