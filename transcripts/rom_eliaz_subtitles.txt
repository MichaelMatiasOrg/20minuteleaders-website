Rom Eliaz, thank you so much for taking the time to be on the show. Sure, my pleasure. Thank you, Michael, for hosting me. Really, I just want to mention, Rom, before we start that we had a session a few hours ago that we were about to start. And you are coming out of the hospital with a mask. And you were telling me that you're working on some different studies in regards to covid. And I just got so much inspiration from that, and I was so happy that we're delaying talk, because you're doing such important work in biomedical. So, first of all, thank you for all the amazing work that you're doing. And now, please, yes, tell me a little bit about yourself. Sure, I will be more than happy to. So, basically, I was born and raised in Israel. And basically, one of the four big cities in Israel. But is actually, the what's called Be'er Sheva, which is basically, the "queen" of the desert. Or the "capital" of the desert in Israel. There are four main cities. And Be'er Sheva is the less appreciating one. The north there is  Haifa, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Be'er Sheva. [--], Haifa in the north. There's Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and  then, Be'er Sheva in the south. But it's David Ben-Gurion's favorite city. So, that's what counts. That's true. [--] And, he went to [--]. Long story short, I learned chemical engineering and biotechnology in Ben-Gurion University, and Weizmann Institute. I did my bachelor degree, and then my PhD in both university. While I was in my PhD, I came across a few patents that we developed. And then, I told that we would like to maybe start a new startup company around our patents. So, I decided that I want to be an executive and maybe the CEO of the company. So, I decided that I need to learn MBA. So, I went to an MBA program. That was the most important because an MBA get started with the professors from a Harvard University and Boston University in Israel. During my last year of my PhD, which was my second year of my MBA, my professor in Ben-Gurion decided to go and start a company in MIT with Bob Langer, it's a huge name in the field of drug delivery and making other devices. So, I wrote a letter to the dean of Harvard and saying, Give you the true Boston program, I would like to do my second year in Boston while I'm actually writing my PhD in MIT. And that's what happened. I moved to Harvard for a year. I wrote my PhD during the day in MIT. And I went to school, I mean, Harvard Business School. And that's where my first experience with the US. And then, graduated. And went to do my postdoc, in UCSF, in University of California, San Francisco. Once I was there, I learned, I actually enjoyed myself in a basketball game. And long story short, I was in bed on my second week of my postdoc, in bed for six weeks, basically cannot move anywhere. What did you do? You're playing basketball. How do you go to bed for six weeks? Oh, because I got my ACL torn apart, my meniscus tear. I went to play basketball, and then, I was injured, and then, I needed to have surgery. And while I was waiting for the surgery, I'm getting full recovery, I basically wrote a grant for the NIH. I got a five million dollar grant. We wrote a few pointers in cancer research about the grant. I then make a grant from the cancer, tobacco research in the UCSF. And from [--], I award a scholarship. So, it was another one. And then, actually I won five million dollars grant, which was a lot of money then. It's a lot of money now too. Yeah. I wrote a few papers in cancer research, and a year later, I got an assistant professor in UCSF. So, I was an assistant professor in UCSF and UC Berkeley for the gene therapy, drug delivery, and biomedical engineering. And then, living in the Silicon Valley, you basically see all these entrepreneurs. And I take my MBA, and I knew that what I really want to do is to start my own company and really help humanity with some new invention and new things that we did. So, I was lucky enough to actually have a few patents in my PhD thesis. But also, in my postdoc. So, I was working on tissue engineering. And then, work with some medical devices and try [--]. So, we wrote a few more patents. We wrote a few for more papers. We're trying to start a new company. But, I then was asked, after actually giving a lecture in London, to join a company called ALZA. ALZA was a company in Silicon Valley started by Alejandro Zaffaroni. And that time, it was 3000 people. I joined. They actually asked me to join around 1999. That was the Y2K. Long story short, I joined them a year later. Actually a year and a half later in 2001. And then, the company was acquired half a year later by  Johnson & Johnson. So, in my first exit, I basically was lucky. I was in the right place at the right time. And once ALZA was acquired for $12.3 billion, all the management went to start Jazz Pharmaceutical. So, I was lucky enough to be on the side to basically go to the management of the whole portfolio of drug delivering of Johnson & Johnson and ALZA. Yeah. I was in Johnson & Johnson for about three years. One thing I want to say before I continue, if someone tell you that luck is not important, it is important. And a better luck is always better than any other thing that you are doing. Rom, I think, you can definitely say that luck is important, but at the end, up until this point where you're seeing that luck is important, you've already managed to do your PhD on biotech. You've already done your MBA through Harvard. So, let's just say that, yes, luck may be important, but in your case, I think your record speaks for yourself in terms of your profession and ability. I think that if you are working hard and you're trying to go to the right places, the luck will go with you. So, at the end of the day, if you are really doing what you need, and even if you fail, eventually, things will go with you. Anyway, I was at ALZA. I was there for about four years. After four years, they wanted me to move to New Brunswick in the East Coast. I didn't want to move. So, I actually join a small company. I was employee number five in a small company called [--]. A company that was started in Palo Alto. I was doing, was basically was a spinoff from Genentech, when Genentech wanted to go only to Oncology to spill out all the neurodegenerative diseases. Arnon Rosenthal was the head of neurodegenerative diseases at Genentech, started this company called Rinat Neuroscience. Today, all you guys living in West Coast know there is a building of Pfizer called Rinat, in South San Francisco. That was where the original Rinat was. Rinat was acquired by Pfizer two and a half years later for like $500 million. And we have one antibody for Alzheimer. We have one antibody for pain. And we have one antibody for migraine, which called the anti CGRP. All of these, except of the Alzheimer, are basically drugs. One is a drug by Pfizer for pain. The other one is a drug by Teva for migraine. Rom, I have to stop you here. Because I have to understand, what is the commonality between all these things that you've worked on? I mean, it sounds like all of them are very very meaningful. They improve the lives of many. They're very challenging professionally because you're actually inventing new drugs. You're inventing new treatments for a lot of these. I mean, just as when you were an assistant professor, you co-authored over 40 publications. Where does this curiosity come from and this motivation to build businesses, or to help run businesses, while at the same time helping millions of people around the world with your inventions? I think it's coming from youth. So, you know what you're going to do. I was, I have a cleft palate. I was a child that was dealing with doctors all my life because I was treated by them. I was fascinated by this medical field. I wanted to be a doctor. In Israel,  you have to go to the army. I couldn't go through the army to, I wanted to be a doctor. The army wanted me to go and learn physics and computers. I said, "I don't want to." They actually gave me my own program at the time. It was a patent called Talpiot I didn't want to go there. They gave me a special one. But at the end of the day, I think, it's really coming from where, I felt that all my life, I really wanted to help society and to help people. I really wanted to be a doctor all my life, or, a violin player. Then, when I was like 17 years old, I actually attempted to Juilliard. But I decided that I'm not going to. Okay. Rom, rega. One is rega. Hold on. I have to breathe. one second. First of all, my brother wanted, Yeah. That's exactly what I'm feeling right now. My brother went to Juilliard. And so, it's very close to heart. I just want to recap. The Army wants you to go to Talpiot, you're probably the first person in the history of the nation of Israel, that declines that offer so that they give you your own program. You get accepted to Juilliard, which, and everybody knows this is like the most prestigious school in the world, for music. I saw my brother, with blood, sweat and tears, all his life until he got accepted there and had a phenomenal experience in the university. You don't go to Juilliard, right? Because you're not a violinist now. You're a venture capital in Biomed. So, you forgo Juilliard. I'm still playing the violin. And I still have my own 2Cds. And I'm still playing today. I'm playing with friends. So, that's the beauty about music. And violin,  in general, you always can do it as a hobby. You don't have to do it as a profession. So, you don't go to Juilliard, but you continue. And, I can't believe, I'm already sad that we only have a few minutes left. But Rom, I have to get your perspective today. You're in venture capital. You're investing as a part of so many different funds, one of them J-Ventures, which we're both a part of. But, I mean, what is it about this biomedical field that really intrigues you? And where are we headed now? So, I mean, as a young entrepreneur, I want to learn, what are the most exciting things in the field, and where can I put my time and effort into helping others? I think, that one of the most important thing in general, not only in a medicine and medical, but anything in life, is that, if you attack a problem you need to attack it from different angles. And that's exactly where medical field is going now. If you think about collaboration now, between the high tech and the biotech, you can see that basically now, with all the AI, and machine learning, and all the digital health, you can basically get so many data. I'm able to collect in the past in a big data, and basically analyze it not only from the perspective of only biology, or how long you're looking into antibodies or drugs, but then, you also can see how they affect. Basically, it's a combination of bioinformatic, that was known in the past. Now, with the big data, and took it to gain the collaboration between all these fields. Like the neural cells, and the big data, the AI, the machine learning. All the data and knowledge that we have, from the medical field, this is where the world is going. It's still going to be, at the end of the day, you still will need to go back to the old biology and find the new targets, and the new therapies for every drug. But the way there, might be much much shorter. You can be much more accurate. And basically, the world is going towards personalized medicine. So, there's not going to be any more capsules, or pills, or anything that you are taking is going, and not even antibody,  that are good for, let's say, about 25% or 2% of the society. Each person is going to have a gene editing or gene analysis. And by knowing that, and knowing exactly what are the expression of genes and receptors that you have, you would know exactly how to target. And eventually, I'm thinking that it's going to be a collaboration of MEMS of nano particles. You know, the great Isaac Asimov, which he wrote on the voyage, the wonderful voyage. I forgot the name of the book. Basically, when you have a little submarine, that's going into the vein, and can actually go through your body and really see what are the problem and solve it, that's something where the field is going. Everything's going to be targeted. It's going to be collaboration with me, between engineering, biology, and basically hi-tech. Rom, I think this is just inspiring. What made you do the transition from an entrepreneur and tech executive to venture capital? And how much time are you spending on either aspects of your professional career now? Are you mostly focusing on one of them? Or, is it always a balance in between the two? I think, it's always a balance. And, it's so important to understand, when you are investing in this biotech field, you really need to understand what is the field. You need to understand, how time things are taking. At the end of the day, it's always people, and it's always technologies. And again, people people people. But, you need to understand this technology here, because you need to know how to make the right investment. And then, at the end of the day, you're investing in peoples. And you need people that know how to solve a situation. That can solve a difficult situation. How to solve a crisis. Because everything in startup, you can see a great business plan. But, at the end of the day, nothing is close to the business plan. It's going completely to a different way. That's why, the people, is the most important thing in everything. And, at the end of the day, if you have good people, and you have the right collection of people from different fields, you always will be able to do all these stuff. But, I'm also assuming that that in the companies that you invest in the medical space, they're not the average, Silicon Valley company. That's another social media app, or another consumer product. This is more long term research that the research is the business, right? The IP of the company and the knowledge, I mean, if it either works and then it's hugely successful, or, it doesn't work and then it dies down. Is that the right comparison? I mean, we are always looking for the cutting edge technology. Always for the next thing, for something that is unknown. For something that is the next thing, because this is the field. If you want to invest and you can do that. You can be a generic, you can be made to, you can be a lot of things. But if you want to be an entrepreneur, and you really want to take a risk, you really need to invest in a cutting edge technology and taking a risk in life. You need to know that sometimes you're taking your own cab, or you're taking gamble on the wrong application. But then, at the end of the day, if you are looking on a variety and a nice portfolio of situations, at the end of the day, you probably, hopefully, will be able to target it all. To be the winner of at least one or two. You need only one Google. And you need only one Facebook. You need only one [--]. At the end of the day, if you are even to get this one, then you will have enough funds to actually invest in other [--] and cutting edge. At the end of the day, you never know. Even a failure technology, at the end of the day can become merge to another technology. And it happened. It happened that we went from one technology, it didn't work. But when we merge it with others, at the end of the day, maybe even five years later, or maybe even 10 years later, because the market wasn't ready. Or, the technology wasn't there yet. It's still, the dreams can become true. OK, so the question for myself, I'm an engineer. I'm studying artificial intelligence at university now. But I definitely want to see myself being an active part into the space that you're in right now, because, I mean, that's where the future is. And this is what is actually going to either save, or at least magnify and help the lives of millions of people, if not billions of people around the world. If I want to be an entrepreneur in your space, and I have the expertise in computer science and machine learning, do I also need to go and pursue academics in biology or biotech? Or, is it enough that I find the right partners who can complement my knowledge with their knowledge and go that? So, this is a serious question that I'm wondering what's the right path for me? No. You don't need to be all of them. For my perspective, I always like to know a lot of things. So, you don't need to have a degree in biology, or something. You definitely need to work with the right people. But, if you ask me, I will definitely recommend that you would take some advanced classes, or, you will take some classes or something in the field. You will always try to learn more and more. It's a never ending process like Fortgame. I have a degree black belt in martial arts. And basically, what I'm saying, never ending excellence. You never can stay in your comfort zone. Always you need to get to improve yourself, to get better, to know better. I wasn't trying to overachieving this, and really trying to go out of your comfort zone. And all the time, learn and learn and learn. Eventually, you will get to drag people around you. You will find the right people. But again,  you need to know one thing really really well. And if you are really good in your AI and machine learning, excel in it. Be an expert in it. So, be a point of excellence from AI in your team. But, definitely try to surround yourself with a team of people coming from the biotech, Especially if you want to go into biotech, people that know how to do business. And then, once you decide to do something in the field, definitely try and learn about it. You don't need to be expert. You don't need to be the best person in the room, in the field. But definitely try to understand what they are talking about. So, you know what's going on around you. Rom, I am so inspired by this talk. Thank you again for giving me your time. Right before we leave, I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. Definitely, Motivation. Never ending improvement. What is this big one? Never ending improvement. Never ending improvement. And, Never stop to dream. Always dream. And once dream a dream, try to achieve it and make it coming true. Wow. Rom, thank you for saving lives. Thank you for making the world better. That's all I have to say. And I'm definitely going to keep you in the loop. And I'm thankful for this friendship and relationship. And I'm going to come back for more and more advice over the years. So, thank you. Will be more than happy to. Thank you, Michael. Thank you. Take care. Bye bye. Bye bye.
