1 Gad Allon, thank you for being on my show. How are you? Great. Great to be here. So, we had a brief discussion just now. It was phenomenal. A little bit of static noise, so with the nature of spontaneity and covid, we're doing this. Gad, a professor of operations, information, and decisions at UPenn, director of the M&T program. Take me to the M&T program, and explain to me, first of all, who is Gad Allon? Walk me a little bit through your journey. And then I'd love to understand why you chose academia, and you have a very special part in academia where you have both legs out in the real world and both legs in academia. Your whole work is in the integration of all of these moving parts. So, I'd love to talk about that as well, but let's start with who is Gad and transition towards the M&T program. Yeah, absolutely. And so, first of all, about myself, originally from Israel as you probably can hear from the accent and from my name. I was born there, was a self-taught software developer from a fairly young age. Worked when I was 16 with a fairly big project with Intel ... at the time. Worked with several Israeli startups primarily in the area of large scale databases. And decided I don't want to be in front of a computer for the rest of my life, are in front of a computer for the rest of our life. And was in the military for a few years. ... unit as a soldier and officer. Again, decided that I don't want to do that. Moved to the US. Did my PhD at Columbia in decision, risks and operations doing game theory and queuing theory. And really, throughout my life was a combination of basically everything I said until now. So, worked with big firm, Pepsi, John Deere, airlines, but continuously also made sure to stay in touch with the more entrepreneurial world, and so work with Israeli firms or American firms in very early stages. Started my own firm while I was at Kellogg, an education technology firm that was acquired later on. Continue to this day to invest in firms and be on advisory boards of different firms and always think about the next step. But few years ago, moved to PENN to be the director of the M&T program that I'll tell you more about it in a minute. But in fact, what academia really allows you is that if you enjoy the ability to go deep into an area and research that, but at the same time the ability to take that and apply it to firms. And if you have the ability to move between these two worlds in a fluid way, and I think I managed to create the flexibility to do that, it's very hard to compete with that type of a job. It's like being a kid in a candy store, because you can continuously pick up what would be your next project. At the same time, you need to have the patience to see some of these outcomes. Right. So I mean, you were an entrepreneur until now with an acquisition behind you. You worked with all these different firms. It seems like the work that you're doing is still very entrepreneurial also within academia, because you're looking at our world, and we'll talk about the gig economy later, but a lot of the insights that you're bringing up they're really trying to understand how do consumers behave and what type of solutions work and what types of solutions don't work, a lot of the same thought process that entrepreneurs do. And obviously you also have the privilege of impacting thousands of lives through the different classes that you teach, but specifically, through the wonderful M&T program, which I got to know through my good friend Jake Goldman, who is an alumni of that. So, tell me a little bit about what this is and why you're helping run it? Yeah. So, the M&T program is the oldest coordinated dual degree program at Penn. So, it's a coordinated dual degree which means that the kids are getting a degree from Penn and a degree, so a degree from Penn Engineering and from Wharton, and whatever they want in engineering and whatever they want at Wharton. Right. But to me ... what I want to explain what M&T is about, I have to, I'm in academia so let me recommend a book. The book is my favorite book from last year, called Range by David Epstein. And he in fact starts by comparing Tiger Woods and Roger Federer. And you say how is that related. Well, Tiger Woods, most of us are familiar with the fact that he when he was really, really young, two years old already, his father put him on the golf course and said, "Play." And that was the only focus. When he was at Stanford, that's the only focus. Only focus was golf. Yeah. Now, many parents, in fact, build their entire educational endeavor around that method. He's actually talking about Roger Federer. Roger Federer is very different. Roger Federer, while everybody knows, of course, how good a tennis player he was, he started tennis pretty late. He was a skier, he was a soccer player, he was a musician, squash, - Squash he was doing many many many different things. And in fact, his mother was a tennis coach and she did not want to teach him golf, coach in tennis. Now, the story is that if the world looked like a golf course which means that, like the Masters, nothing changes ... Then doing one thing since you're born is the right way, but ... The world looks more like a tennis game where things are changing continuously because there is an opponent that is moving and is improving their skills, what he calls a ... then actually being fluent in multiple skills, being able to do multiple things at the same time is really what you want to do. And so, he's talking about Copernicus and Van Gogh and many others that actually are fashioned much more on what Federer did, and in fact, what M&T does. 'cause M&T is really saying you need to be someone that can build products, so you want people that are very good engineers, people that understand design, but you also need people that can motivate ... and build teams, can build culture, can think at the level of an economy and understand stakeholders. And you need this kind of right brained, left brained, IQ, EQ, whatever you want to call that to really make impact at scale. And that's what like, for M&T, and I can talk about more about because it's really beyond just the program. It's an amazing Alumni group. And so, for example, for many of our students, the first job they got was from an alum. Their first investor was an alum. And when they come to campus you have a really small cohort of students that are continuously with you, but also you have an amazing alumni group. Look at the founder of StubHub and Snapdeal in India, and the guy that runs TMT for Goldman, and the guy who ran TMT for KKR, and the guy that started AQR, all of them are alums, and all of them have amazing access to our students just willing to come to campus, do office hours, give students advice, just an amazing access that, I think, does not exist really in any other equivalent program. No, and you mentioned before that this is also one of the most difficult programs, right, out of Penn, and they work extremely hard. I can testify from watching Jake work how hard they work. But one thing that I was also very taken was that when he was so kind to walk me through the campus and took me to the building where the M&T cohort works out of, pre-covid times and hopefully post-covid times. And it's really, it felt like an open space of a melting pot of ideas with people that are all passionate about making change and about innovating, right? So some of them, I'm guessing, are a little bit more drawn towards certain areas in engineering, some of them a little more towards finance or business, but what they're sharing, and what you look for also in the participants, is this yearning passion for making change and for being leaders. And it sounds to me that what you're referring to here, the specialist versus the generalist, to make impact at scale and to really change, understand consumer behavior and move the needle, you need to be more of a generalist, right? Right, exactly. And so, to some extent, what you see sometimes people feel frustrated by being a generalist. And in fact, you do need to be a specialist in something to be able to make impact, to have a path for yourself, but to make impact at scale, you need to be able to jump between multiple worlds. And it creates some frustration initially, but in the long term, it's a little bit like being a bilingual, right, and being bilingual means that at least initially, you're really not that good at any one language. And in the beginning it's very frustrating, but we all know that bilinguals are much better in almost everything they do than people that studied multiple languages sequentially. This is what we are talking about here. Interesting. No, and obviously at the end it's not to take that they're stretching themselves thin on either subject, I mean, they're excelling at both the engineering school and the business school. It's not that they're giving 50 here, 50 here. My guess is that usually they have pretty good grades, and usually they come up close to the top of the class, so it seems a little bit natural. But I'd also love to talk about the workforce. And you do interesting, fascinating, remarkable research with the gig economy, which is an economy that I got introduced to back in high school when I was running a startup called AnyMeal. And we had to understand how can we get a lot of things done, and we didn't have the immediate resources in my neighborhood for people to help. And without knowing it, I had friends all over the world who on-boarded the organization and the company, and they were performing tasks which I just didn't have the expertise ... So, talk to me a little bit about what is the gig economy, and how is it changing a little bit the mindset of what does it mean to actually work? Yeah, it's a great question. So, first of all, we have to understand the gig economy on the heels of what ... built. And so, the reason, I almost have to go back to the introduction of firms. Firms exist because of the fact that what we call transaction cost economics. It's very hard to manage many subcontractors, and that's why I want to be there to have them within the firm. What has changed? Multiple things. First of all, mobility. All of us have a device in our hands, so I can always find someone. Second thing is data. I always have the data and the ability to understand who is in need and who has the skill and I can try to match them. So what it means that ... see in the last few years, and the names you hear a lot are, of course, Uber and Lyft and DoorDash, but these are the ... The firms that I'm interested in are firms like UpWork and 99designs and then you get to HourlyNerd. And then you get to firms that are really taking whatever McKinsey and BCG and Bain did and say, in fact their slogan was, for HourlyNerd was, "Why should you pay for the partner's second vacation home?" We can bring you the consultant. ... does the work. We'll bring you that person, and we'll charge you actually only a fraction of that. And so, that's the main thing, rather than having all of these skills. So if I'm a firm, I can get into all of this. If I'm the person, I need to design a website, I can find that person. If I'm a person that does, and it's not from the demand side, it's from the supply side, you have people that their skills were very unique, too unique, too niche. There is no too niche now. Why? Because if there is someone that has the need for your skills, they will find it. They will find on Facebook. They will find somewhere. And so the combination of demand and supply created essentially a world of abundance. There is really no shortage of people anymore in any specific skills. What we need to do, however, we need to build a platform to help- The matching process. Exactly. That's what we see now. What we call gig economy, we talk about usually about these firms that are doing the matching between the two. And just to give you an idea, we talk about around 2% of the US now that are making their the majority of their income from the gig. The majority? The majority of their income. We talk about the fact that around 60 million people had at least one encounter where they got their income from the gig economy. We are talking about the fact that it's going to increase in the next five years the economy by, the GDP by around 3.5 trillion dollars. So, we're seeing here that you have over 30% of the workforce just in the US, right, who's experienced receiving compensation for a gig job. And here we say gig interchangeably, but this could be that you're in a ridesharing service and you're not tied to one firm. You can go on to multiple firms, right, and we see that of course. Or it can be that you're on a firm like UpWork or 99designs. And I have to say the one thing that truly excites me is that obviously, on our side as perhaps the clients, we are able to get things done quicker, more efficiently. But on the other end, this two sided marketplace, it excites me that all of a sudden people all over the world, not just in the US, but people have these new opportunities that they never had before. Access to Internet, whether it's a mobile or a computer, now allows anybody in the Philippines to become a book editor or to become an illustrator for a book written by a 24 year old in Palo Alto, right. So it's really incredible opportunity, and it's mind boggling how fast it's growing. Right, exactly. And so, that's exactly what we see. We see more and more labor arbitrage on one side, that's kind of one way to think about it. Another way is that people have much more freedom to actually maintain careers in area that in the past was very hard to maintain, in location that, in the past, was very hard to maintain. That's exactly what we see now. But you do very interesting research on exactly that question that those decisions that a lot of these people are having to make. One of the things that I'd love to talk about is what motivates people, right? So, both in terms of what does it mean to be a gig worker, but then what are the different factors that either contribute or lack thereof towards their motivation to work? Yeah, so that's a great question. So, first of all, from the outside, what motivates them is really, the majority of them, actually in fact, don't start with that as a job; they start just as a supplement and then they see it actually offers them a lot of flexibility, which is really the main reason most of them are there. The majority is the fact that they have flexibility they never had before. But now we want to go into the micro, and to me at least the interesting thing about this economy is that if you think about the current economy, most of us make decisions on where to work once a year. Once in seven years if you're in academia. Once in every maybe, once you get tenure, that's your last decision. People here make decision where, how long, and what has to take minute by minute. The question we started with was, Should we start and develop a whole new labor economy? Because you hear a lot of debate on the policy side and what ... optimize. And so we had to first of all see what are the main assumptions we need to make, what are the main ideas we need to see when we look at how these people make decisions. And so we got data from a ridesharing firm on each transaction they had for a whole year. Every offer that was made, every job that was taken, everything, everything, everything for a whole year. And we look really at three factors. We look at what's the impact of income, the offer, basically the wage. It's not really a wage, but the equivalent of wage. Right. If people are rational, that's the only thing that should matter. And the first thing we saw is that actually that matters and matters a lot, which really means that most of these drivers, in this case, the drivers are highly rational. I'm saying that because we hear a lot ... approach, let's say that you need to protect these people and they're not rational, they are captured. And in fact, most of them are very rational. Wages go up, they go more. Wages go down, they actually drive less. There was a bit of a noise there. Can you just go back and re-state what did you find, are the drivers rational or not and why? Why you think that they are? Yes. So let me actually, first of all, outline the three main factors we looked at. We looked at, first of all, the impact of earnings. So, whether the higher the wage offer, because these drivers get an offer, at least in that firm. And the question was, everything else being equal, if the offers become higher are they more likely to accept the job and work longer? And the answer was yes. Not surprising. Not surprising. Surprising for some people, I should say. Actually there are a lot of research from the 90s on taxi drivers where chose the opposite. That the more you pay them, they actually the less they work. So we show no. But the second thing that was interesting, actually, we looked at how much people earned until now. And we saw that the people, the more they earned until now, the less likely they are going to continue to work and the fewer hours they work if they continue to work. So, again, the more they earned until now, the less likely they're going to continue to work. Do you explain that because they have a bucket of expectation in their mind, and they're reaching the top of that expectation? Yeah. I mean, that's ... main explanation. The main explanation what we see is income targeting. No one has a dream of driving for Uber. You want to drive for Uber only to the extent it allows you to get a certain level, and now you can go and play with your kids. But here comes probably the more interesting result. The last result was to look at what's the impact of the hours they worked until now on the likelihood to continue to work. And here, we saw a very interesting result, because the more hours they worked for that specific firm, the more likely they are to continue and work for that firm and the longer hours they will continue. And I should say this is within a driver, so it's not across drivers. Within the same driver, take multiple days, a day in which he work longer up to that point is more likely to continue and go to work longer. And that is surprising. That's very surprising. That's the first indication in the literature of that behavior. And we call it inertia. And our explanation for that, by the way, is that while these drivers are looking for flexibility, they also like within that flexibility they like the ability to maintain a certain schedule or a certain level of consistency. Now, why it's interesting? It's interesting primarily because ... significant implications for policy, for example, because if drivers are, we know that if people, unlike with our many activities we do in life where we're the only one impacting ourselves. Here, when you put someone on the road, and they want, the longer they'd driven until now they're going to drive even longer, now ... posing risk to other people. And in here what I see is actually interesting regulation in New York, but really try to monitor the same drivers across multiple firms and trying to understand how do we protect society from people where they can actually harm not only themselves, which is bad to begin with, but actually harm society overall. And of course, there is a conflict of interest because a lot of these firms, they have an incentive to keep as many drivers on the road at any given moment, because that gives me a better experience because I have a match within a minute, right? I'm curious, do you think that is a similar behavior exhibited by gig workers in other industries? Or is that primarily a thing for mobility? That's a great question. That's what we are trying to understand now. But I'll say one thing, however, on what you said. I don't think the firm always would like to keep drivers driving. I think the firms, in fact, when I speak with firm, with people in these firms, and that's now across the board, they would like people to be on the road when there is work, and they prefer that they be home when there is no work. They believe ... actually pay, exactly. They actually believe they pay in goodwill if these drivers are going around looking for jobs and there is no job. So, predicting behavior is actually really, really key for them. This is fascinating. What other things, 'cause the gig workers is something that's been your recent endeavor, right, but you've done more research across the years. So, what are some other really interesting questions that you've been asking yourself throughout this research that are relevant to the world of entrepreneurship? Yeah. So, one area that I've been dealing with quite a bit in the last few years is how people process information. And let me explain what I mean by that. We are in an era where, more than any time in history, we have more information in our hands. And in fact, we see people potentially know less about the world than we know in the past. And so that's ... where we started. We started, I would say, in a world where people have more information, but this information is coming in a very high speed and in very, very small chunks. When I talk about that I'm really talking about this. The fact that information has the size of a screen, and within this screen, we have very little time to decide what we read and we move on and now there is a new flow of information. So, we look at that situation, and we say in a world like that, where also the information sources are more and more unknown, right. I mean, think about the world that I was born to. The world I was born to we had two newspapers. In the US it was The New York Times and The Washington Post. ... in Israel we're different. You had one or two TV channels, maybe three. Now, we don't talk about The New York Times anymore. We talk about is it ... or is it ... I mean each and every source now is a different source. If you look at covid, many of the people that actually brought covid into attention were not even from the main journals. Many of them were actually side players. So, the question we are looking at is a situation where you look at the data, and one of the things we show, in fact, is that because of the fact that we have proliferation of sources that are in themselves are not very credible, when I said not credible, some of them are credible. I'm not talking about fake news, by the way, I'm talking about really the fact that we are trying to assess the level of information in the same time that we're trying to figure out what is really the truth. If we do that, what we get we get to see that it's actually a highly polarized world. And then why we get a highly polarized world? 'cause when I evaluate information I'm going to evaluate from wherever I am. I'm going to evaluate given the information I have, and if the information is already polarized, it would become even more and more polarized. The reason it's interesting for me is that we live in a world of platforms, and what we can think about is how do we regulate many of them. But what we are trying to show, in fact, is that regulation, unless you really understand why we see what we see, we might actually regulate the wrong side of innovation. And that's what I'm worried about. I'm worried about that we tend not to think about the ... We tend to not think about the implications of regulation without truly understanding how people make decisions, whether it's drivers, whether it is about news sources, whether whatever it is about. And so, that's an overarching theme of what I'm trying to do. And as you can see, many of that is really talking about things that have changed the last few years with a lot of this impacted by current changes in technology and the way we consume information. In just a minute, why professor, why teach? Why stand in front of classrooms? Sometimes dozens, sometimes hundreds of students and talk about these things that you're researching? Yeah. So, that's a great question. And in fact, I had a faculty at the Technion, Avi Mandelbaum, that said whenever you do anything, you have to think about what is your scope of impact. When you do consulting, it's five minutes from now. When you teach executive MBA students, it's a year from now. When you teach undergrad, MBA is five years. When you teach undergrad, it's 25 years from now. Many of them are, it's too early for them to impact now, but you by yourself, if you teach them things that have not only, it's not only about what you teach, it's also teaching them how to think- Impact, MBA five years from now, but undergraduate, 25 years from now. Yeah. And then research, 75 years from now, right? You want to teach people how to think not only what to think. You want to teach them the way, and in fact that impact is very, very hard to have any other way. And so, I enjoy being in the classroom. I love being in the classroom. Many of my students I'm still in touch with them. In fact, almost every week I speak with two, three students, former students. So, very hard to replicate this type of experience. Unbelievable. Gad, before we leave, I want to thank you again for being so generous with your time. This was just wonderful and insightful, and I love watching the different lectures that you have on YouTube and I urge anybody who is remotely interested in any of these questions that you're asking yourself which I'm sure every young entrepreneur is because the labor force and decision making and operations and processing information is that's what 2020 is about and, of course, moving forward. But before we leave, I have to ask you for three words that you would use to describe yourself. Yeah. So I'll say, first of all, integrity. I believe in integrative thinking. I try to integrate many things. Rigourous. I try to go as deep as I can to every topic I take. And very direct. My students know that I'm very direct in everything I say, both positive and negative. Michael, great to be here. I love it. Gad, thank you very. very much. Toda raba. This was just wonderful. Take care. Take care.
