1 Most people in Silicon Valley, you know, they have a hammer and everything is a nail. And that hammer is tools and they're going to build a tool for everything. And the mindset is pure software, AI is going to do everything, humans are irrelevant. Humans aren't even going to exist in the future. Francis Pedraza, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Thanks for having me, Michael. It's a pleasure to have you. We actually met for the first time seven years ago. You came to speak to our summer class at MIT LaunchX. It was about Everest, which I know that it's a long time back for you now with all the different things that you've done since then. But thank you for being such a source of inspiration for us back then. It was really fantastic. Thanks for remembering and for reaching out. Of course. Of course. I'm really excited to have you here. Francis, I'm not going to do justice to go over the incredible bio, because you've actually had a pretty incredible upbringing. A pretty global one. But all sorts of diverse activities. I would love to just spend the first few minutes going a little bit over your journey. Who are you? What are your passions? And I think that will be a really good leeway into the things you're doing today, and some source of inspiration for young entrepreneurs like myself. My mother grew up in Iran and came to United States before the revolution. But when the revolution happened, her world changed. And she had finished her undergrad but she dropped out of graduate school, became an entrepreneur and worked really, really hard to succeed and did. And then when she had me, she sold her company and focused on raising me. My father grew up around the world. His father worked for Procter and Gamble and other American companies. So, he spent some time growing up in places like Japan and the Philippines and Venezuela. And so, you know, I think I got the immigrant value set, which is a lot of hustle and determination and hard work and a sense of, I think, patriotism for the United States. This is a place where dreams can happen and you're in a free country, you have property rights, rule of law, and you can build something here and express your potential. And that was my upbringing. And my life changed, I was pretty frustrated in both public and private schools for a variety of reasons until I discovered this incredible Internet entrepreneur who is teaching hundreds of students on Skype. Zoom did not exist back then. But he happened to be a local. And he was teaching them a five year course in the great books of Western Civilization. And the first book we studied was Homer's Iliad, and then the next was The Odyssey. And then we went on to read many of the ancient Greeks and the Romans and then the medieval Scholastics, Renaissance and Enlightenment and Moderns and a number of subjects. And reading the original sources, writing about them, debating them, discussing them. And so, I developed this passion for the humanities. And people asked me, "How did you go from that to starting a company?" And my first company was called Everest. You remember it. It was an iPhone app to help people achieve personal goals. And I thought that Steve Jobs had this metaphor that technology could be a bicycle for the human mind, you know, that it would almost be like an Iron Man suit. Like we could express our potential with these tools at a pace that we'd never been able to before. You could move on the speed of thought. And then, we sort of live in this dystopian reality where, you know that t shirt that has, like, you know, the ape and then a homo sapiens standing tall and then humans behind a laptop and then we look like an ape again. It's like we live in this dystopian reality where it feels like we're slaves to our devices instead of the other way around where these technologies are empowering us. Like, why is that. And so, with Everest, I was trying to build a social network except around doing things instead of around who you know. And you would have all your goals in the app. And I thought that we could live up to that Da Vinci and Dream, have a new renaissance and have people pursue their full potential and have technology actually help. But the company failed. The app failed. And it was a very humbling sort of Icarus experience where I had to learn a number of lessons, both about how to build a great product, how to build a great business. But it also made me rethink some of the fundamentals. And with Invisible, my current company, I've tried not to compromise on the vision. I think same vision. Just different business model, different mission. And I've been trying to apply the learnings to solve a very, very different problem, which is industrializing knowledge work. So, before we go into that, I have to go back a little bit and understand about that Icarus-like experience. Because inevitably, you know, almost all entrepreneurs are going to fail multiple times until they get to their success. And I'd love to focus a little bit on this side of the story. I remember when you came to speak to us, I remember how we all looked at this amazing product that you are building, and the charisma and the vision. And we all bought into it immediately. We knew this was going to be a major success. We loved it. And you have to understand, Francis, that this is a bunch of you know, 16, 17 year-olds entrepreneur wannabes, that they're getting so excited and are buying into these products. I need to have this closure to understand what happened there and why do you call this an Icarus-like experience? And what lessons really do you translate now to your next venture? Yeah. It was a beautiful product. Apple featured it many times, I think the design community recognized the work that our designers had done. And it was before Facebook had an iPhone app. Remember when they were Facebook thought their corporate strategy for a few years was they were going to be Web only. Until they realized that it was a mistake. It was the early days of the App Store. And we had nearly half a million people use it. And their initial experience with Everest was kind of this, you know, euphoric experience. Wow, I could put all my goals and dreams into the app. I want to go to Italy. I want to look like Daniel Craig in a bathing suit. I want to run a marathon. I want to buy a house. You know, all the things, you just fantasize, almost, that part was easy. But where the business failed is that three, four, five, six months later, people would stop making progress on their goals. It was almost like Instagram for your goals where you could post photos and videos, but also complete steps like a checklist and make progress. And the discipline required was too high. So, our business model ended up looking like a gym. You know, gyms don't make money when you get fit. Gyms make money when you want to get fit. They divorce monetization from retention. And that was a key principle that we'd missed. And we thought we were going to be a business model look like Facebook. But basically that business model is selling dopamine like a drug and like a digital cigarette. And it doesn't really require effort or follow through. And so, oops, a beginner's mistake. And that was the Icarus moment. So, fast forward to today. Tell me a little bit about the insights of the industry in the market even before we get to the actual product. Because you have some really fascinating insights into where we're headed as a global economy, and the workforce, and that's leading into what you are working on today. So, I'd love to really get into your mind, and understand the motivation behind what you are you doing and taking a little bit of a leap forward into what's going to happen in the next few decades. Yeah. I'll start by describing what Invisible is and then I'll share some, some predictions about the future. So, every company has complex and custom processes and they're very difficult to automate. Even if you know about all the latest automation tools, even if you're aware of robotic process automation, RPA tools or workflow or no code automation tools, or you're aware of the relevant, you know, software point solutions for the particular function you're trying to automate. So, it's sales or hiring, the marketing or an industry specific, you know, workflow you're trying to build. They're all these tools. There's an app for everything, why isn't everything perfect yet. And the answer is that when you try to automate your process, any one tool might help you automate five, 10, 15% of it. But you can't get the end to end solution you need to run your business tomorrow. So, what do you do? You either do the rest of it in-house manually, or you outsource it to a traditional outsourcing company. A business process outsource or a BPO. And BPOs are like law firms. Their incentive is to bill you as many hours as possible. They're selling labor They don't have an incentive to automate on their side. So, Invisible is combining outsourcing and automation for the first time, and we call it work sharing. And our technology is a digital assembly line. And it has two layers: the first is we coordinate 280 workers in 35 countries around the world who can log in to secure virtual desktops and follow step by step instructions to do the manual portions of the work; and then the second layer is that we break down these custom processes into standard steps. We think of it like sequencing in the corporate process genome, and then we will automate those steps over time and they become reusable. And our business model is a win win. As we automate your process, your unit price goes down and our margins go up. So, it's a win win. We have an incentive to automate and you see your prices drop. And our inspiration for all this was what Henry Ford did to manufacturing in the early 20th century. Every, you know, this is like pre world war I. I mean, the whole story of Ford from like 1908 to say, 1960, is fascinating. But every year, the quality of their cars improved, the price decreased, their revenue increased, their margins increased, and the amount that they paid their workers increased. These things are in trade off relationships. This shouldn't happen. And it only happens through the economic miracle of productivity gains which create deflation. And deflation is good. I call it the deflationary gospel of capitalism. Better, faster, cheaper, better, faster, cheaper. And I think that we're at a stage where the mission of the company, with Invisible, is industrializing knowledge work. It's not automating knowledge work. It's industrializing it. And it implies a more nuanced view of automation. And this is what I'd like to communicate to your audience. Most people in Silicon Valley, they have a hammer and everything is a nail. And that hammer is tools. And they're going to build a tool for everything. And the mindset is pure software. AI is going to do everything. Humans are irrelevant. Humans aren't even going to exist in the future. Ultron is coming. And I think this is ridiculous. And I think this is where some of the liberal arts background kicks in. I think, in many times in our history, we've always thought we're at an exponential curve and it didn't end up happening. Things happened quite differently. If you read Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, for example, with the tractors coming and automating agriculture, arguably the productivity gains of that era were greater than the ones that we're experiencing today. This is what I think is likely to happen. I'll speak in very broad statistical terms. There are just, a pop quiz for your audience. There are eight billion people on the planet, how many people play video games? Think about it. Put the answer in your head. Two billion. It's three billion. Three to four billion. And then how many people do knowledge work? Like, make their livelihood on a computer in some way? One billion. You did your homework. Exactly. So, there are one third to one quarter as many knowledge workers as there are video gamers. Now, I'm going to attribute this to Cathie Wood at ARK Invest, whose research I follow closely. But basically video gaming is like a sort of onboarding. It's training for the world's future knowledge workers. And if you think about what's going to happen over the course of our lifetime, do we think there are going to be less than a billion knowledge workers by the time we die or more than a billion knowledge workers. And it just seems sort of obvious, sort of ask the audience to grant it to me as a premise or an axiom or an assumption. I could defend it, but I just think it's so sort of obvious on its face that there are going to be many, many more knowledge workers. It doesn't make sense that one out of every eight people, work on the Internet. And seven out of every eight people work in the physical world. The digital world is becoming more and more part of everything that we do. Every industry is basically becoming digitized. So. I think they're complimentary trends in robotics, you know. But I think that basically in our lifetime, we're going to have up to four billion knowledge workers, maybe more. So, think about what that means in terms of automation. If we were actually going to automate even 50% of knowledge work, then we would go from a billion knowledge workers to 500 million knowledge workers in our lifetime. And 500 million other people would have to either be unemployed or find some physical work to do. But I think the opposite is going to occur. I think what we're going to experience is net negative automation. That doesn't mean we're not going to automate. We're going to automate a lot. But I think the key economic principle is work can be created faster than it can be destroyed. And we can destroy it pretty fast. We can industrialize it and automate it and build all these tools pretty fast. But not as quickly as we can create it. And I think that we're going to be in a sort of dialectic where humans are doing a thing and then computers learn how to do that thing. And then humans do another thing, like a new trick that we then teach the robots and then we're going to keep doing that dialectic for a lot longer than people think. And I think that you want to design your business model around that, or at least our business model has been designed around that. I think that those are going to be the really interesting opportunities. Not necessarily the selling pure, pure SaaS, pure tools. Francis, why do you care so much about this? Why? I mean, I saw how much you cared about Everest. I saw that passion. And I'm seeing the passion now. I'm feeling as if I'm back in that MIT class in 2013. Why do you care so much about this stuff? Because the future doesn't, I mean, almost by definition, should be very different than the past and presumably better. And I think one way of thinking about it is if you saw a human being that was seven feet tall, you'd be like, wow, that person is pretty tall. You saw a human being that was eight feet tall. You'd be like, are you in the Guinness Book of World Records? Like, you're like three standard deviations, tall. If you saw a human being that was 70 feet tall, you'd call the military. It's an alien. It's not a human anymore. It's like, you know, it's Godzilla. It's a giant. There are just not 80 foot tall humans. But that's a metaphor for what is possible with productivity gains. And I think that the mindset of Silicon Valley has been the Turing test, which is when can computers do all the things that humans can do that we can't tell. And I think that that's the wrong test for a number of reasons. I think the more interesting test is the da Vinci test, which is I think Steve Jobs's original intent. Which is, you know, in the 21st century, when will the average person be more productive than the most productive person in the 15th century. And I think that in sort of a a one on one productivity test, da Vinci with his piece of paper, would school any millennial with their laptop and iPhone. And I think that that's the embarrassing thing. That we have all this information and all these tools, and yet we're spending so much of our time not being creative and not being strategic. So, I think part of my message is, is deeply optimistic. I think I really believe in the good that humans are capable of. But part of it is like a real reprimand in a sense, like an exhortation. Like we, Harvard said that up to 50%, 41% of the average knowledge workers time is spent doing work that is repetitive. And I think we just did not get the education and the opportunities that we have. And we do not live in this incredible era in order to spend half of our time doing irrelevant, doing work that isn't our highest contribution. Right? And we should have a certain urgency around solving problems, creating things. And I think that, Peter Thiel has I think, has the right philosophy, the right pessimism in his basic message, which is that like, you know, the iPhone is new, our digital devices are new, but when you walk around our cities, they still feel like they're in the 20th century. Why is that. You know. And I think that there are, Cathie Wood in ARK Invest talks about five technology platforms that are disrupting pretty much have the potential to disrupt every aspect of our society. I think the five are, I'm going to hope I get this right: FinTech and blockchain robotics and industrial automation, AI and automation, which Invisible is in, and sort of software automation enterprise tools, the genomic revolution, everything is happening with CRISPR and gene editing and everything that's happening with autonomous vehicles. I think those are the five. But the reason I list them out is that there's, you know, this is such an exciting time to be alive. But we kind of have to have a fire about it. What's the phrase, "light a fire under your ass". I can definitely feel the fire, the passion, the urgency. I'm getting so much inspiration. But Francis, before we end, you have to tell me the Peter Thiel story. You told it to me seven years ago back in MIT launch with Everest. I need the short version now for the audience. Because it will be just fascinating. If you feel comfortable with it, of course. Sure. So, yeah. He is one of the people that I look up to most. Still to this day, I think he's an intellectual giant. And I just graduated from college and I was starting Everest and I had some people interested in investing but hadn't been able to make a breakthrough there. And I met someone at an airport. You know, right when pretty much I was thinking about quitting and I was working on the designs for the app. And somebody looked over my shoulder and saw the designs. And then asked me some questions and I answered them and I told them about the idea and he said, "Would you like to raise money?" And I said, "Yes." And they said, "For who?" Well, you know, from who angels or VCs. And I said, "Angels. But specifically, Peter Thiel." He's like, "Well, I actually happened to go to Stanford with Peter and I can introduce you." And I spent half an hour, tops, talking to Peter, telling him about it. And he said, "Well, send me some some materials." And I just wrote a 50 page business plan. Everest created one of the first web based pitch decks. And we released it right around Christmas and didn't hear from him. And then New Year's Eve, sure, I'm in for 50k. And then everyone else came in and we raised two point six million and did this journey for three or four years. And it was a lucky break. But something I think I'm always going to be grateful for and I think they're still, I think it's a good example of some magic, you know. There are certain things like generally, you should operate with assumption that every single win you have to fully earn it. And, you know, but as I look back over my career, there have been a number of people that have given me favor and key moments, and those were fortunate circumstances, I'm very grateful for them. And I think that's part of what made Silicon Valley great. And I think it's still there. Francis, I love it. Thank you for sharing the story. Thank you for sharing all the other stories. This was just inspiring to listen to again and with the new insights. And I can't wait to keep following your journey and continue getting inspired. So, thank you for everything that you're doing. Both to me, the listeners, but also to humanity, when with all the different products that your building. Before we leave, I have to ask you the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. And I know that I'm already keeping you late, so thank you for being generous with your time. Yeah. Iconoclast, classicist and amateur. Iconoclast, because I tend to go against the norms, even when the norms are aesthetic. Contrarian is a word we're familiar with. But iconoclasm has a sort of aesthetic connotation that sometimes, being a contrarian kind of, it's actually unpopular and weird and even can look ugly. And it's like, what are you doing, it's a weirdo. And I think you have to embrace that. And then classicists, because I think that which is ancient, is often futuristic. There's the things that don't change that you can learn the most from. And I think reading original sources in general is good, and particularly when it comes to books. I love reading books by dead people. Then amateur, because in the old word "amatore", you have to have a certain love for trying new things and being like a child and making mistakes. So, I have many things that I do that I'm not an expert in by any stretch of the imagination. Like I love to paint. I love to learn about subjects I know very little about. Like I was reading a bunch of white papers about autonomous vehicles and it's totally out of my depth. But, hey, I think that helps make you well-rounded. And I think that for a couple hundred years, everyone's been trying to become more specialized. But I think going back to the Renaissance idea of being the polymath and being versatile is a better way to go. But to do that, you have to embrace the identity of an amateur. Francis, thank you so, so much. This is wonderful. Stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you again. Cheers Michael.
