All right. Itai Pinki! Thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Thank you for having me. You know, just five minutes ago, you sent me, on WhatsApp, pictures of us from 11 years ago in my bar mitzvah. I still remember that day, I'll never forget it, the day that you came to my house so that we can discuss the bar mitzvah plan. And half an hour through, you had my watch on your wrist. And I'll never forget that moment that my mind is just out of this world. I think you traumatized me really. I think that's what happened. If you're being traumatized, then you invite people to your podcast, that's weird. [laughs] Definitely, definitely. No, but seriously, I think magic is just so incredibly powerful; that sensation that it gives people and the impact that it leaves on people. Talk to me a little bit about what you do. You're one of the most incredible magicians in Israel. Talk to me about that. Thank you, first of all. I think you said it by yourself. I think magic is the only art form that creates a unique sensation. For instance, when you see a juggler juggling 10 knives or an acrobat doing crazy stuff with, I don't know what, you say, "Oh, my god, that's amazing," you applaud; you respect them for their practice and for their art. When you see a magic, a good magic trick or a magic show, you ask how. This is the only art form that creates this kind of question, saying, "How does he do it?" It makes this in your brain. Yeah. This is why magic is happening and still happening for years. Because human beings love to be intrigued and say, "How?" Yes. Because you know, we're intelligent people. We know how things work. When you become an adult, you understand life. Then comes someone, and like this. [snaps fingers] makes your watch disappear, like you say, "Oh, my god, I'm intelligent. How did you do it without me noticing?" - So I think -- -Right. [crosstalk] Walk me a little bit back in your life because I have to know how do you even get started as a magician. How do you discover this innate passion of yours to amaze and intrigue people? I don't know who said it. One of the greatest painters in the world. He said, "A painter is a kid that just continued with his doing." Every kid does this when he's a kid. And then, you become a painter, a famous painter, an artist when you become an adult. - Not all of us. - Right. A lot of people can play the piano. Not everyone becomes a veteran. Magic is the same. I think most of the kids, I think mainly boys, get like magic kits, or magical book or something like this, and they play with it like for 10 minutes or a week, and then they stop. I know you're more than that because you love magic, but most of the kids are like doing it for a week or a few days. And then, they continue playing basketball or whatever it is, -their other hobbies. -Right. I think a magician is just a kid that continued. He just loved it and did it more and more from this because -- Like every time we did the magic trick for someone -- I began magic when I was 15-ish and left it, and continued with my sports. At the age of like 19, give or take, I came back to this like my passion. My kids -- as a kid, my passion when I was a kid. And every person I showed him a magic trick told me, "Okay, can I have your business card?" And I was like, "What business card? This is a hobby, man. I'm just doing this to hit on girls." And people told me, "But this is like you can make a living out of this," like, "I need your business card. I have an event," or whatever. And when you hear it, once you say, "Okay, that's a great compliment." When you hear it like 15 times a day, you say, "I think I should make a living out of this." So that was 19 years old when you decided to go from a hobby to actually becoming a full-time magician? As a profession? Yeah, I think when I'm like 20, I already got booked for serious events. -Incredible! -Maybe [unclear] and stuff. Not huge conferences, but it was like I got paid already for my gigs. Right. So now, Itai, you're a little bit different in the field in the sense that you're not just going and doing street magic in bar mitzvahs and weddings, and so on, but you do huge conferences and you're doing a show, and you call it stand-up magic. -Yeah. -I'd love for you to tell me a little bit about this combination of stand-up and magic and how do these two intertwine with each other. Yeah, so first of all, the combination is, as you said, stand-up magic, you can understand by the name. It combines stand-up comedy and magic. The combination, I think, is natural, because most of the magicians use comedy or try to be funny, at least. I don't know whether they're all funny but they try. They use gags and comedy bits. And stand-up comedy is being funny. The art form is very similar. The crowd, the target audience is the same. Stand-up comedy and magic, it's entertainment. Yeah. It's not like combining ballet dancing with stand-up comedy or opera with magic. But it's still forces you to be creative enough to create a show that has both the elements of jokes --  and entertainment --  Yeah. on the set of comic, but also the magician's wow factor. Yeah, actually, it's much more than just comedy and jokes. It's literally I needed to begin a new art from the beginning to being a stand-up comedian. For the crowd, it's okay, it's like the same, "He's very funny. He uses very good jokes." It's not like a joke or two. In my show, I have like a set of 10 minutes with the mic, just to set the comedy band like Brock, we call it. Just the comedy set in the middle of the magic tricks. So it was literally like teaching myself a new art form from the beginning. So it was difficult for me. For the crowd, it's like, "He's very funny." They don't know the difference, I think. Actually, a week ago, I spoke with someone that's on my show, and she told me, "I love the act, and you know what? Your magic tricks, they were good also. They're amazing." I've been doing this for 15 years, of course, they were good. [laughter] But she perceived my show as a stand-up comedian using magic tricks. And I think that the main, actually, issue with my show is whether one comes to see the act when he thinks it's a magic show or a stand-up comedy show, because if he thinks it's a magic show, it will be damn funny. And if he thinks it's just a stand-up comedy, it will be very surprising. I love it. - That's the thing, I think. Yeah. - I love it. Now, Itai, you're not just a magician. You're also, actually, an entrepreneur, and I had the pleasure of coming to one of your Sorcerer's Sundays in Tel Aviv, which was one of the most incredible night out experiences I've had. Tell me a little bit about this project. You actually do it with lot of your magician friends or you just amaze people every Sunday at a restaurant. Yeah. Actually, it's a weekly show, the longest weekly show in Israel. -  Wow! -  Like we've been running for six and a half years prior to the COVID19, of course. - Right. Actually, yeah, the format is a dinner show. And the idea was founded about the principle of there isn't a dinner show in Israel, and there isn't a good entertainment in English In Israel. Like if you have friends or family from abroad, people come to Israel. They can take them to the cinema or to a restaurant, and it's not entertainment in English. - And I think every city - Right. in the world, it's the same. When I was in Argentina, I went to see a tango dinner show; or in Spain, flamingo, or the opposites. Flamingo, it's in Spain, I think, yeah. So every city, a big city, tourist city, there is this dinner show, show entertainment, whatever, and it's almost always in the language of the city, of the country. - Sure. - And Israel is the same. When you come to Israel, there isn't anything in English. So, this is how we began thinking about this. We said, "Okay, we're going to do a dinner show in English ―entertainment for English speakers with magic, because magic is cool and everyone loves magic." It's for adults, of course. - Yeah. - And the cool part is that every show, every week, the show differs. - Right. - It's like -- it changes. Yeah, we have like 10, 15 magicians, all speaking English fluent. For instance, we have four magicians this day, and someone comes back after three months with his sister that came from South Africa, or whatever, they see a new act, because there are four new magicians. So people see the show over and over again. We have people coming like 10 times, and like 12 times That's cool. And it's not just that the show on stage is different, but it's also the interaction with the people. I mean, the magicians go around the tables and they come up to you, and you really get - that whole vibe, which is - Experience. Yeah. The whole experience is incredible. So Itai, I have to ask, we're doing this over Zoom. Now, ideally, we would be face-to-face in Israel. But with COVID, you're still doing shows and you're still entertaining people, and you're still doing conferences. - Yes. - How do you do that during COVID times? How do you do magic over a computer screen? In the beginning, it was like, "Okay, we'll just wait for this to pass, and we'll go back to our lives." And then we were like, "Okay, it takes more time than we expected." Yeah. [laughs] That's I think all of the world thinks like me, and it's like, "Okay, it's a thing." [laughs] So, actually, I thought about Zoom. I said, "Okay, I'm going to do shows on Zoom," it's very different because I don't have the crowd, the interaction, and bringing people on stage, and hearing the laughs. And then I said to myself, "Myself, it's not the same thing. - So, don't think about it as --" - Don't force it. Yeah, you can't wait for the crowd to applaud and say, "Okay,, you can't just do your show and expect it to be the same in Zoom." No, it's not the same and it will not be the same. You need to adapt yourself and adapt the show for Zoom, like the last time we did a show, and I want to do some jokes. Okay, so I did my bits and I put everyone on silent because I need them to hear me, instead of them hearing people in the house, and whatever. Right, right. So I can't hear the laughs. I can see them laughing but it's silent. It's like a bad comedy club ―it's silence. You hear only the crickets from outside. I'd do a gag, and that was my mother. And then I'd hear... [imitating cricket sound] Wow. And I can see them laughing. So they're having fun and they enjoyed it, but it's difficult. It's different. That's what it is. Can you get it --? Can you get the magic across? That astonishment? You know, sometimes people, when you flip a bottle and it showed that it's empty now, people want to go and see it and they want to put their hand onto it to see that it's really in the air. Now, they can't do that, right? Because now, it's all virtual. Yes, they can't physically wise, but I think -- Actually, it's a philosophical discussion, because I think the magician -- the people, the skeptic, they say, "Yeah, you know, I hate magic. I want to figure out the tricks. The only thing I want is to figure out the tricks." I think this person isn't problematic. I think the problem is with the magician performing. I think that if the magician -- like magic, when you think about it, it's very, very condescending. I think Seinfeld said... it's the best. Seinfeld said, "A magic show goes like this. Here's the coin, now it's gone. You're stupid." [laughs] This is exactly like (what) most magicians do. They make you feel stupid. And I think it's a problem. I think when you're condescending, and you're being, you know -- How do you say it? Patronizing? - You know, - Yeah. on your audience's expense, - it's a problem. - Yeah. They feel stupid. When they feel stupid, they want to figure out the tricks. I can see -- All the time,  I see my colleagues going on TV, and their first phrase is, "Okay. Today, I brought something that will blow your mind. I'm going to fool you today." Why? I think magic isn't a  competition like me against you. If you figure out the trick, you won. If I fooled you, I win. - This is not a game. - Right. This is not like basketball, a winner and a loser. I think we're both on the same side. We're having fun. I'm here to entertain you, -  and you're here to have fun. -  I love it. Let's do it together. - I love it. - And I think the crowd feels it. When they get this feel, this vibe, they don't want to figure out the tricks, like in the beginning of my show, I'd do a comedy bit just about this, about, you know, the people trying to figure out the tricks and whatever. And the subtext is "Don't." Not because I want to fool you. I will fool you. This is not the idea. This is not my mission. I love it. No, I mean, you're so approachable on stage and your show is mainly for adults, right? From what I remember correctly with some of the jokes, but really, I mean I've seen quite a few magic shows, because I'm a huge magic fan myself. And your show is one of the most that I enjoyed the most because you're so approachable and because you just make it such a unique experience as a friend, and it's not as "I'm up here. You're down with the audience. Now, just get ready to be fooled, - then good luck figuring it out." - Yeah. Itai, I have to ask. We're here over Zoom. Can you show me something and give me the experience of what it's like to be in a magic show in COVID19 times? I can try. I can try. Let's do this. Can you see the clip? Yes, I can. All right. Let's put it here. I'm good. I want you to think of -- - I will -- - [laughs] - [laughs] - magically place it on the floor. [laughs] Nailed it. No? Not yet? Wait a second. I have to do this. You know what? I'll do this and this. [foreign language] - All right. - Nailed it. [laughs] So I want you to think of any three-digit number Okay, got it. No, don't go with 333 because that's very obvious. Shoot. Okay, now -- Okay. I have a new on You're good? Yeah. You can say it, what is it? Six-eight-nine. Four hundred and fifty-nine, yes? I'll go with six in the beginning, six-eight-nine. I have hearing problems. So let's go with my number, okay? [laughs] Sound good, sound good. I'll do it as clear as possible. You said 689. I don't know -- wait, wait, what -- That's a [unclear] drop, like a mic drop. Itai, what the F? - What the hell was that? - Magic. No way. Okay, I did not -- [crosstalk] Now, your viewers will think, "Yeah, they planned this." [crosstalk] "He's playing along." This is what -- Okay, you know, this was maybe one of the simplest but most impressive things I've ever seen. [laughs] I don't think I can continue to do this interview right now. I'm a little bit shook. [laughs] And I was thinking of 2-8-9 in the beginning, and I was like, "You know, no, I'll change it to 6-8-9." Yeah, I know, I know. Okay, that was just crazy. Okay, let's just move on and then I'll go. I'm not going to sleep tonight. This is just crazy. Itai, humanity is changing. Things are becoming more technological. People are becoming impatient. People's standards are rising. Because of technology, all the immediate gratification -- What is happening to the magic industry? Because it seems that magic today is still pretty similar to what it was when Houdini was alive. But now, things are becoming more technological. I don't know anything. So maybe you can correct me. Where are we headed with this? I don't know where are we heading, but things do change. Humanity change. Technology change. Yeah, things change and magic correlates. Magic changes also, you know? It's not Houdini, actually. One of the first magicians that made magic as a theatrical, like a prestigious thing. He wore a suit and everything, it was Robert-Houdin. It's not Houdini. Houdini did deskology. Robert Houdin did big boxes and doves, and then the grand illusions with that, sawing a woman in half, and then -- whatever. - Yeah. - This was in the 50s, and 60s, and 70s. In the 80s, we had Uri Geller, you know, reading minds. Things change. And nowadays, . people aren't that naive They don't want you to read their minds. So, that story changed. Nowadays, it's more like a psychological mentalism. Derren Brown in England, he began all these -- Yeah. This thing is about -- you know, "I influenced you, and I read your body language." Right. So things change. You can't say magic is the same because magic isn't, nowadays, sawing a woman in half. Right. There are magicians that still do it, but they can't make a living, I guess. They're stuck in the 80s. Yeah. And so, how does technology fit into this? Technology does fit into this. With technology, we have new magic tricks. We have Marco Tempest doing stuff with iPads, and we have very visual stuff, and things do change. Things change. Like fifteen years ago, we had David Blaine doing magic tricks in the street, - you know, street magic? - Yeah. And he understood people are more interested about the reactions. So David Blaine, what he did, not only the tricks, but instead of putting the camera on the magician, they pivot and they showed the reaction. He did a small trick, and they had the crowd yelling for one minute. So that was Blaine. And then we have Dynamo, and whatever. Nowadays, we have Instagram magicians. No presentations, no nothing, no patience for the viewer. People just see a trick, five seconds, bam, bam, bam, and it's done. So I think this is the way things change. I don't know whether it's just the technology, but it's the medium. Like nowadays, with the Zoom. Yes. So fast. - Things change. - Definitely. Itai, I can't believe it, I said that 20 minutes are going to go away so quickly, and they have. - Unbelievable. - Already? I have to put you on the spot once, and I didn't prepare you for this. So I'm sorry in advance. But -- - Okay. - I want you to tell me three words that you would best describe yourself as, or if I ask anybody watching your show, when I think of Itai Pinki, what are three words that I think of when I picture Itai? Wow! Okay. Actually, three words that I will describe myself are very similar to the three words one seeing my show will describe me. I think I'm bringing myself to the stage. - Yeah. - So when people see me after the show, they feel like they know me. This is good. This is my idea. So I would go with -- in this order. Funny, intelligent, humble. - Interesting. - Or modest. I love it. [laughter] Itai, I love it, I can't wait to see another show. I can't believe it's been 11 years since we met when I was just 13 years old. - And then that -- - We'll put the pictures. I'm going to do this, and the picture will appear from your bar mitzvah. Boom. [laughs] Put it here with your editing. I love it. Itai, thank you so much Thanks, Michael. See you soon. Bye-bye! Ciao!
