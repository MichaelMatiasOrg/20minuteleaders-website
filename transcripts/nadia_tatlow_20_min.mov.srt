1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,834
But the people you can really learn from

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,200
are the people who are somewhat disappointed

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,281
if they can't,

4
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:07,940
if they couldn't use your product every day.

5
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,311
Nadia Tatlow, thank you so much

6
00:00:40,511 --> 00:00:41,280
for being on my show.

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,040
How are you?

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,480
Good.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,240
Nice to meet you finally.

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,880
Definitely.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,000
Thank you for being here.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,800
Vast experience in PR and marketing,

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,520
the CEO of Shift.

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,600
I want to go back before we get

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,080
into your professional journey.

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,705
Where do you come from

17
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:58,699
and how do you go on your journey

18
00:00:58,899 --> 00:00:59,905
wanting to become at the end

19
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:02,840
the CEO of a startup?

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,462
Yeah, I guess so.

21
00:01:04,662 --> 00:01:06,350
So, I am Canadian,

22
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,600
based in Victoria, BC.

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,760
And that's where Shift is,

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,400
has been founded and grown from day one.

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,576
So, the whole team is based here

26
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,800
on the West Coast.

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,600
My background, I actually moved to Victoria

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,080
about seven years ago from Toronto.

29
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,920
So, I did my undergrad and schooling

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,640
at Queen's University in Kingston.

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,040
And years before that

32
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,834
I had moved around a lot

33
00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:32,560
growing up with my family.

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,407
So, I think I've always been

35
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:37,440
very entrepreneurial

36
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,800
about the way I approach work.

37
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,680
And that's kind of been

38
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,400
a theme from day one for me.

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,480
I've also, I think,

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,840
lived in a lot of different places,

41
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,160
and that has influenced a lot about,

42
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,102
I think, the way I work

43
00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:51,393
and the way I want to work,

44
00:01:51,593 --> 00:01:54,200
and just how I think about work in general.

45
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,120
So, I think, yeah, when I found Victoria,

46
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,161
to be honest, I moved here because I thought

47
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:00,680
it was such a beautiful city.

48
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,120
I have some family here.

49
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,384
So, there is that was kind of calling me

50
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:09,280
from moving across the country in my 20s.

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,466
So, yeah, I think

52
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:13,185
wanting to be able to live in Victoria

53
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:15,240
and build a company and sort of

54
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,802
achieve all the things in my career

55
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:19,120
that I want to do.

56
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,049
It seemed like a

57
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:21,792
kind of an awesome opportunity

58
00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:25,200
when I originally took a job out on Victoria

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,760
to start building that out.

60
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,065
And yeah,

61
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,280
I couldn't be happier to be here, I'd said.

62
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,880
It's not a bad place to be even.

63
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,520
Even through this covid and pandemic stuff

64
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,600
we're all going through.

65
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,971
So, how do you find yourself?

66
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:41,040
You're starting with PR and marketing.

67
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,200
You've held several positions

68
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,960
in that world before initiating Shifts.

69
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,000
So, what was it about that industry

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,440
that interested you?

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,032
And why made the transition later on

72
00:02:54,232 --> 00:02:56,120
to becoming the CEO of Shift?

73
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,440
Yeah.

74
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,768
So I guess the reason I got into PR,

75
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,887
I remember the first time I heard

76
00:03:02,087 --> 00:03:04,402
what public relations was,

77
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:06,360
I was actually doing a,

78
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:06,960
in university,

79
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,240
I took a summer job at a daycare

80
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,440
like a Montessori daycare.

81
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,720
And I got chatting with one of the parents

82
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,960
that I just seemed kind of like a cool guy.

83
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,699
And I remember he had founded

84
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:19,960
his own PR consulting business.

85
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,560
And so, that was really my first time

86
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,960
getting any introduction to what PR was.

87
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,680
I did my undergrad in political science.

88
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,720
So, and I love talking about politics.

89
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,513
I love that world of.

90
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,040
So I, but I often realized

91
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,733
I was graduating post 2008

92
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:41,593
and realizing political science

93
00:03:41,793 --> 00:03:43,480
wasn't the direct path

94
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,240
into the kind of job that I wanted to get.

95
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,707
So, after talking to him,

96
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:47,880
I remember thinking,

97
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,200
you know what, this is such an amazing

98
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,640
kind of introduction into business.

99
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:57,360
And I think a lot about business

100
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,237
comes down to PR.

101
00:03:58,437 --> 00:04:00,108
And whether it's kind of business PR

102
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:02,720
and brand PR or personal PR,

103
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,800
it's all very important.

104
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
And also telling the story

105
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,549
and the narrative about your work

106
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,640
or your company or yourself

107
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,080
is so critical to success.

108
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,600
So, I decided to do a postgrad program

109
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,360
in public relations.

110
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,120
Met a bunch of amazing people through that.

111
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,000
And it was a great network

112
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,440
to jumpstart my career.

113
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,880
So, that launched me into working

114
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,480
at a marketing agency in Toronto,

115
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,200
which I really enjoyed.

116
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,960
But ultimately, I think I saw myself

117
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,520
moving more into the product side.

118
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,640
I think I saw the highs and lows

119
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,440
of what it is to work in an agency

120
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,189
and you learn a lot and you move fast

121
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:44,280
and you really learn of the service role

122
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,561
and you get to exposure

123
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:47,160
to so many cool brands and products.

124
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,122
But I think I realized pretty quickly

125
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,885
that I wanted to build something of my own

126
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,600
and really kind of be the person

127
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
behind the brand rather than

128
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,760
kind of serving someone else's.

129
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,120
So, there comes Shift.

130
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,640
So, what is Shift?

131
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,888
What are you trying to do there?

132
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:06,520
So Shift,

133
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,822
I think in the shortest amount of words

134
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:10,120
is a browser for work.

135
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,720
So, we started shift about three years ago.

136
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,245
Really as a really solving for the pain point

137
00:05:17,445 --> 00:05:19,360
of multiple email accounts.

138
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,880
So, and there's a little bit of back story

139
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,280
in that. Shift actually spun out

140
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,720
of a company I was working at.

141
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,960
So, I was managing marketing

142
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,951
across a bunch of different brands

143
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:31,720
at a company here in Victoria.

144
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,200
And there are a few of us that sort of

145
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,640
would jump on a project every time we had

146
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,880
a new idea to, or a product idea,

147
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,593
we would sort of fire up nadia@,

148
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:47,560
whatever this new product idea was.

149
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,221
So, domain and email,

150
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:51,040
and that meant calendar,

151
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,560
and drive associated with each of those.

152
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,240
So, we were very much in this world

153
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,520
of multiple email accounts.

154
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,800
Like I think I had seven or eight

155
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,040
at the time we launched Shift.

156
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,696
So, that's one side

157
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,852
of the workflow pain point

158
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:06,880
that we were solving for.

159
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,480
But we approached Shift from day one as

160
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,280
we have this pain point ourselves.

161
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,692
Let's build something to solve for this

162
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:18,772
and then see the reaction and the response

163
00:06:18,972 --> 00:06:20,505
and sort of build iteratively

164
00:06:20,705 --> 00:06:21,880
on the product from there.

165
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,760
So, almost as soon as we launched Shift,

166
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,280
we started getting feedback that people,

167
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,160
like this is amazing,

168
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,480
I also have this pain point.

169
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,667
A lot of people working in design

170
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,561
or marketing or consulting businesses

171
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:34,785
where they also kind of lived

172
00:06:34,985 --> 00:06:36,600
the same experience as us.

173
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,680
And then they, but they also

174
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,857
often had extensions and apps.

175
00:06:41,057 --> 00:06:42,824
And basically all these other things

176
00:06:43,024 --> 00:06:44,800
they were doing at work in the browser

177
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,760
that they wanted to move out.

178
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,137
So, that really fired up our engine

179
00:06:50,337 --> 00:06:52,472
and told us that we had early signal

180
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:54,241
of product market fit.

181
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:56,280
And that really kind of

182
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,503
the vision for Shift was much, much bigger

183
00:06:58,703 --> 00:07:00,653
than an email service

184
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,440
that was really a browser for work.

185
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,796
So, when you say browser for work,

186
00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:06,480
what does it actually mean tangibly?

187
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,320
If I go to Shift right now,

188
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,960
what would I see?

189
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,573
Yeah, so,

190
00:07:10,773 --> 00:07:12,960
you can download Shift at tryshift.com

191
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,800
It's a downloadable desktop app.

192
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,720
So, it sits on your computer,

193
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,324
just like if you use the Slack's desktop app

194
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:24,920
It's a similar download experience.

195
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,942
So, basically,

196
00:07:26,142 --> 00:07:28,196
it's built on the electron framework,

197
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:30,851
which is actually the same framework

198
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,760
that Slack is built on.

199
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,680
And you download it for free,

200
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,590
you set it up,

201
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,541
and then we have a premium experience

202
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:39,708
that you can upgrade to

203
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:41,718
if you decide you need all the apps

204
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:43,760
and all the extensions,

205
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,520
unified search, workspaces, all that.

206
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,564
So really, the way I look at it is

207
00:07:49,764 --> 00:07:51,684
most of us now will operate

208
00:07:51,884 --> 00:07:54,396
throughout our workday with

209
00:07:54,596 --> 00:07:57,000
a browser open at all times.

210
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,760
And everyone has a very different workflow.

211
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:04,481
Some people open multiple browser windows

212
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:05,560
to organize their workflow.

213
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,040
Some people actually have the,

214
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,360
are consistent about Gmail profiles,

215
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,560
and that's amazing if you are.

216
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,640
And so, they'll organize work and personal

217
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,760
and whatever else they do by Gmail profiles.

218
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,480
Other people will use multiple browsers.

219
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,582
So Safari, Chrome, Edge,

220
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:26,560
whatever it is that you like.

221
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,319
But what we found is that

222
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,997
this workflow experience

223
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,520
is very different for everyone.

224
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,409
And there's no one way

225
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:36,959
that everyone likes to work

226
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,560
and is consistent about working.

227
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,331
So, we want to kind of give you

228
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:41,880
this flexibility with Shift,

229
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,991
but also spoon feed you

230
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,848
a much more organized,

231
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:47,511
sort of streamlined experience

232
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:49,120
so you can actually get work done

233
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,129
and stop having to do the administrative,

234
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:55,200
like there's a lot of buzz about there,

235
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,880
out there, about work about work.

236
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,899
So, trying to remove

237
00:08:58,099 --> 00:08:59,446
that work about work for you,

238
00:08:59,646 --> 00:09:02,708
so that you can actually do focused work

239
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:05,320
and kind of eliminate distractions.

240
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,400
So, if you're looking at your insights

241
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,073
into the product

242
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:10,139
and it's interesting because you say

243
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:12,600
you transition from PR and marketing

244
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,380
[--]

245
00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:16,766
and more towards the product, and then,

246
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:17,899
really going through that

247
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,120
entrepreneur process of finding

248
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,936
product market fit,

249
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:21,605
doing the spinning off of different products,

250
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:23,680
pivoting and then finding your sweet spot.

251
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,360
What were some of your aha moments

252
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,760
along the way with Shift that you set up?

253
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,000
I now understand, I have an insight

254
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,720
that a lot of others may not have right now.

255
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,320
Yeah, I think that's an interesting one.

256
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,424
I think it's been very,

257
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:40,146
like sometimes I think about the way

258
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,498
we approach the business very much

259
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:44,080
as horse before the cart.

260
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,360
So, I think my background in marketing

261
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,000
and the company that we spun out of,

262
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,182
it was very much along

263
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,820
the performance minded

264
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,520
when it came to marketing.

265
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:56,400
So, prove that there's product market fit

266
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,347
before you overinvest in building a cart

267
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:04,136
that might not solve the right problem.

268
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:06,210
So, it was an aha moment when,

269
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,614
and probably the biggest aha moment

270
00:10:08,814 --> 00:10:10,000
in the early days when

271
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,964
our customers started asking for,

272
00:10:12,164 --> 00:10:13,324
and very early customers

273
00:10:13,524 --> 00:10:16,280
started asking for extensions and apps.

274
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,915
And basically, okay, this is

275
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:20,147
we want more than just email.

276
00:10:20,347 --> 00:10:22,347
Email's kind of a focus point,

277
00:10:22,547 --> 00:10:26,442
but it's not, it's not our entire workday.

278
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:28,520
So, they were asking for that.

279
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:30,246
And you always have to balance out,

280
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:32,269
I think, running a company,

281
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:34,930
how much you listen to customers,

282
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,012
and how long you wait,

283
00:10:37,212 --> 00:10:39,444
and how many requests for something.

284
00:10:39,445 --> 00:10:40,560
Especially in the early days,

285
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,320
you need to pile up

286
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,040
before you really take action.

287
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,160
But it was so clear.

288
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,680
So, that was aha moment very early on,

289
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,880
I think,

290
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,523
I think now what we're working on

291
00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:54,093
is really more focused on

292
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:55,435
how to help people

293
00:10:55,635 --> 00:10:57,400
work better together in Shift.

294
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,280
So this has been another really,

295
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,800
I think aha moment.

296
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,350
We all have our workflows

297
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,880
and sort of our,

298
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,891
I think our individual work styles.

299
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:12,240
And with Shift, it's interesting because

300
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,128
we talk a lot about tab hoarding

301
00:11:14,328 --> 00:11:15,724
and sort of that mess

302
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:17,373
that can pile up on your computer

303
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:18,726
that you actually

304
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:20,760
don't want anyone else to see.

305
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,520
I'm looking at that mess right now.

306
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:23,880
Yeah.

307
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,920
I mean, by the end of a workday,

308
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,480
with you're at, I guess,

309
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,476
you could have dozens of tabs,

310
00:11:29,676 --> 00:11:30,341
open windows,

311
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,440
and you don't even know

312
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,364
where your day started or ended.

313
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:36,423
Yeah, and then that's a pretty common.

314
00:11:36,424 --> 00:11:38,712
[--] you just close all of them

315
00:11:38,912 --> 00:11:40,680
because you would just want to start scratch.

316
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,840
You don't even want to understand

317
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,760
what you had over there.

318
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,960
It's awful. Every day the same thing.

319
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,520
Totally.

320
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:47,840
Yeah.

321
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,480
And I think that's so common.

322
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,053
But there's also sign of

323
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,560
sort of some shame around that.

324
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,945
So, we wanted to help people

325
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:55,909
streamline that and also sort of

326
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:58,379
better prepare themselves for when you're,

327
00:11:58,579 --> 00:11:59,405
especially with all this

328
00:11:59,406 --> 00:12:01,040
work from home stuff.

329
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,880
When you're jumping on a video call

330
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,872
with someone and then all of a sudden

331
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:05,597
they want you to share your screen,

332
00:12:05,797 --> 00:12:08,800
and you want to look and feel prepared.

333
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,243
So, we built a layer on Shift

334
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:12,760
called, workspaces.

335
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,920
And essentially you can think of that as

336
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,115
like a focused collection of

337
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:17,840
tabs, apps, bookmarks,

338
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,824
that you would actually

339
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,080
want to work with someone else on.

340
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,589
So, you can easily just share it

341
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:24,720
with your collaborators,

342
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,520
and then there you go.

343
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,344
You've got this clean place

344
00:12:27,544 --> 00:12:28,560
to get stuff done.

345
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,960
So, that was a big aha moment, too.

346
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,758
Is that as individual

347
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,406
as your personal workflow every day is,

348
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:39,440
we don't work in silos.

349
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,680
Most of us don't work by ourselves.

350
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:45,280
And I think the more we work from home,

351
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,555
and the more we're forced

352
00:12:47,755 --> 00:12:49,920
to do Zoom for everything,

353
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,512
the more we kind of have to

354
00:12:51,712 --> 00:12:53,413
put purpose back in

355
00:12:53,613 --> 00:12:55,920
in the way we work together.

356
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Right.

357
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,240
I think it's really interesting.

358
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,920
One of the things that I

359
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,405
was fascinated by this past year,

360
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:03,558
in one of my classes at Stanford,

361
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:04,775
we read a case study

362
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:07,248
about Superhuman, by Rahul,

363
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:09,520
in a first round magazine.

364
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,824
And it was talking about

365
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,627
how he found his sort of NPS score,

366
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,420
and how he figured out

367
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,876
who are his target customers

368
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:22,640
and how to accelerate their growth

369
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,600
in certain areas of his company

370
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,280
to target those customers.

371
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,120
Do you have any process

372
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,040
that you're thinking through:

373
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,280
how do I understand,

374
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,737
how do I cluster my customers,

375
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,304
and how do I really make sure

376
00:13:34,504 --> 00:13:35,200
I maximize on those

377
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,240
that really love our product?

378
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,903
Yeah. That's interesting.

379
00:13:40,103 --> 00:13:41,292
I think Superhuman

380
00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:43,426
has done an amazing job of that

381
00:13:43,626 --> 00:13:47,099
and of understanding their core audience

382
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:48,880
and in speaking to them.

383
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,518
Even the onboarding flow that they did

384
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:54,419
and the fact that it's really all,

385
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:56,752
they force the word of mouth.

386
00:13:56,952 --> 00:13:58,640
Like, I think, I think you still have to have

387
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,280
an introduction to their team

388
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,120
in order to get Superhuman.

389
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,320
So, you can't even just download it, right?

390
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,520
Which is really interesting.

391
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,143
And it really allows for that word of mouth,

392
00:14:12,343 --> 00:14:14,560
but across the Internet

393
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,120
to feel a lot more authentic.

394
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,720
So, what we do is we really, I mean,

395
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,942
we definitely see demographic consistencies

396
00:14:24,142 --> 00:14:26,200
and groupings of people

397
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,280
that we know Shift will really speak to.

398
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,024
But I think our audiences

399
00:14:32,224 --> 00:14:33,477
is very, very broad.

400
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,903
And the more diverse and broadly

401
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:40,280
we can speak to people, the better.

402
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,960
So, we do things like,

403
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,220
there are surveys within Shift

404
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,999
where we we ask things about job title

405
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,012
and an industry,

406
00:14:52,212 --> 00:14:53,640
so that we can better understand

407
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,320
and better cater to each of those people.

408
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,160
We end up seeing a lot of,

409
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,414
I think millennials are a huge part

410
00:15:01,614 --> 00:15:03,451
of our core audience

411
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:08,200
because so many of us have a work life,

412
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,160
maybe a side hustle and a personal life

413
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,280
that all a lot of those

414
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,400
part of those lives happen on the Internet.

415
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,912
So, you have email accounts

416
00:15:17,112 --> 00:15:18,136
and calendars and apps

417
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:19,160
that go with each one.

418
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,503
So, helping people organize

419
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:22,353
and make sense of that work life balance

420
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:24,920
that I think we're all trying to achieve.

421
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,080
So, we see consistency with that.

422
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,041
But with the onboarding process

423
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:31,579
and even NPS scores, actually Superhuman

424
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:33,745
did a really interesting

425
00:15:33,945 --> 00:15:35,576
survey of their users

426
00:15:35,776 --> 00:15:39,007
that we also, we saw in and ended up using

427
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:41,160
for our customer base as well,

428
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,240
where they asked the customer base:

429
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,255
how disappointed would you be

430
00:15:46,455 --> 00:15:49,160
if you no longer had whatever products

431
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,120
of Superhuman or Shift?

432
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,780
And that was awesome.

433
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,320
Because it's kind of, the results,

434
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,760
we actually got the exact same results

435
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,963
with our audiences as he had laid out

436
00:16:00,163 --> 00:16:01,868
in his article about it,

437
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:05,430
where I think it was 25% of people

438
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,440
were very disappointed if no Shift,

439
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,695
50% were somewhat disappointed

440
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:13,480
and 25% were not disappointed.

441
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,760
And those results have been for a lot of

442
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,040
what we do and who we do it for.

443
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,640
The key point that really stuck with me

444
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,645
with that is that

445
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:25,000
you're always going to have this 25%,

446
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,120
well, you're not always,

447
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,817
but you really are amazed

448
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:31,200
by this 25% kind of super fans.

449
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,040
And we get those ambassadors

450
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,960
that Shift is their daily driver

451
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,200
and they can't live without it.

452
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,450
And we love those people.

453
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,044
And we love talking to those people

454
00:16:41,244 --> 00:16:42,120
and getting their feedback.

455
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:43,869
But the people you can really learn from

456
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,280
are the people who are somewhat disappointed

457
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,897
if they can't, if they couldn't use

458
00:16:49,097 --> 00:16:49,960
your product every day.

459
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,350
So, really kind of digging into

460
00:16:51,351 --> 00:16:54,120
where that somewhat came from,

461
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,320
has been a great or very informative

462
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,440
exercise for us.

463
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,880
I think one of the things that I took away

464
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,800
from during that exploration

465
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,977
and understanding,

466
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:08,205
and as a Superhuman fan myself,

467
00:17:08,405 --> 00:17:10,006
it was about understanding

468
00:17:10,206 --> 00:17:13,760
that it's okay to sort of give up

469
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,080
on certain groups and focus on others.

470
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,720
And I think it's almost intuitive for us

471
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,754
to see that there is a group

472
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:19,964
that really doesn't care.

473
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,246
And you're almost insulted

474
00:17:21,446 --> 00:17:22,120
that they don't care.

475
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,320
So, you want to work to win their validity

476
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,600
and get them to join you.

477
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,480
And you sort of and you don't realize that

478
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,688
they might not be the right group

479
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:32,640
to maximize your efforts.

480
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,696
And especially if you're a fast growing

481
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:35,708
early stage startup,

482
00:17:35,908 --> 00:17:37,726
you can only focus so much of your energy

483
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:38,480
on certain areas.

484
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,194
And it's definitely important to know

485
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:41,120
where to focus them.

486
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,710
What has been the most challenging

487
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:44,895
and most rewarding

488
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:46,480
part of this journey for you?

489
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,671
And one of the things

490
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:49,089
that I wanted to bring up

491
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:50,920
that we didn't get to discuss was,

492
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,340
you didn't actually start out

493
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,560
as the CEO of Shift, right?

494
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,200
You started out as a general manager there.

495
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,240
You've proven yourself,

496
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,560
and then, you became the CEO.

497
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,840
But what were some of the biggest

498
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,800
challenges and rewards along the way?

499
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,520
Yeah.

500
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,172
I think the challenges are kind of tied

501
00:18:08,372 --> 00:18:10,960
into exactly what you just said, which is,

502
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,120
especially with Shift,

503
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,120
like our audience is basically anyone

504
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,283
who uses a browser at work all day,

505
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:20,000
which is all of us.

506
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,872
And we can prioritize

507
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:26,400
the way we approach customer acquisition,

508
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,206
which is really a big part

509
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:30,360
of our competitive edge and how

510
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,880
we've really grown as fast as we had.

511
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,080
So, I think,

512
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,639
I think it's segmenting your audience

513
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:37,440
when you have them.

514
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,880
It's very exciting to have

515
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,760
a massive audience.

516
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,520
It's also a huge technological

517
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,160
or technical challenge.

518
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,200
But it's really, you know,

519
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,640
finding ways to spice and dice that audience

520
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,097
so you can tackle

521
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,909
the most important pieces first

522
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:56,520
and speak to the most important

523
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,360
audiences first.

524
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,972
So now I think three years in,

525
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:03,320
it's fun to be able to have a core engine

526
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,784
of people that we know we can reach

527
00:19:04,984 --> 00:19:06,800
and reach very efficiently.

528
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,012
But then consistently sort of layer on

529
00:19:10,212 --> 00:19:12,324
and broaden who we speak to

530
00:19:12,524 --> 00:19:14,280
and how we speak to them.

531
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,600
So, that's a big focus right now,

532
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,000
is is really broadening that.

533
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,720
Second part of your question,

534
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,600
what was the other part?

535
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,560
Sorry?

536
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,664
The rewards.

537
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:28,600
Some of the most rewarding moments.

538
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,330
Yeah. The rewarding part about it is,

539
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,240
I think, building a team.

540
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,496
Like building a team is so critical to,

541
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:39,520
I mean, ultimately,

542
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,040
you go from kind of doing everything yourself

543
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,760
with a couple other people.

544
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,680
And then really sort of hiring the people

545
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,760
who are ultimately going to build the product

546
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,000
in the later stages.

547
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,320
So, I think,

548
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,120
it's rewarding and challenging,

549
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,760
but I think a lot about

550
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,611
the creator, the builder and the optimizer

551
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:08,398
and where we're at now.

552
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:10,440
Where we have

553
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,920
a significant customer base of people

554
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,958
that are using Shift every day

555
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:17,520
to drive their workday.

556
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,680
We have a lot of responsibility

557
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,440
to those people.

558
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,828
So, there's a ton of optimizations

559
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:24,635
and bug fixes and requests

560
00:20:24,835 --> 00:20:26,640
and customer success,

561
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,880
targets that we're dealing with all day.

562
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,960
So, that is a huge part of the business now

563
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,320
that we have this responsibility

564
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,920
to these customers year over year.

565
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,360
But you have to just keep creating

566
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,440
and you have to keep building.

567
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,360
So, balancing that out.

568
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,065
And then I think ultimately

569
00:20:41,265 --> 00:20:43,880
identifying people on your team

570
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,630
as one of those

571
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,080
or some combination of those.

572
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,840
It's definitely not black and white.

573
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,440
And people evolve over time.

574
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,240
But at the stage we're at,

575
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,960
we do need all three of those.

576
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,730
And I think there is, it's exciting because

577
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,170
there's so much opportunity

578
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,669
for everyone on the team

579
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:03,640
to sort of evolve into the positions

580
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,035
that are best for them

581
00:21:05,235 --> 00:21:06,880
and sort of grow with the company.

582
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,858
So, yeah, I think, that's rewarding

583
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:10,440
and that's rewarding for me.

584
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,840
I think a lot about it as almost manifesting

585
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,490
our own growth trajectory

586
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,160
and manifesting what we want

587
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,410
out of our own career,

588
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,048
which has always been

589
00:21:20,248 --> 00:21:21,760
sort of my driving force.

590
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,960
100%. I think that's just wonderful.

591
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,400
I want to thank you for being so generous

592
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,952
with your time.

593
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,840
20 minutes go by very, very fast.

594
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,036
And I really appreciate

595
00:21:30,236 --> 00:21:31,440
you taking time to do this.

596
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,360
Before we leave,

597
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,760
I have to put you on the spot one time,

598
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,200
and I have to ask you for three words

599
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,320
that you would use to describe yourself.

600
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,361
Or if I ask anybody

601
00:21:39,561 --> 00:21:41,617
that is working with you or for you,

602
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:42,760
what are three words

603
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,720
that they would use to describe Nadia?

604
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,000
I think,

605
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,240
probably excitable,

606
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,160
open minded and hardworking.

607
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,362
I love it.

608
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:02,160
Nadia, thank you so, so much.

609
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,163
This is really great.

610
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,481
And I can't wait to share this

611
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:05,040
with the world.

612
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,000
Thank you so much, Michael.
