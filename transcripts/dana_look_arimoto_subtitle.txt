1 Dana Look-Arimoto thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? Great. Thank you for asking. It's been quite a whirlwind, 2020. We were supposed to do this last week when the fires broke out in California. So, just as we thought we've seen it all, it looks like there's a little bit more coming. But  we're doing it. So, I'm very thankful for being so generous with your time and for being so flexible. Sure. To start off, you have four dogs. Among them, 15 legs, only three of them can hear. Tell me a little bit about your rescue dogs. Well, they're rescue. So, like all of us, they are differently abled. One has three legs, one can't hear. And we love them all. I love it. What are their names? Leo, Leilani, Scooter and Lily. Oh, I love it. Very very cute. Wonderful. Okay. So, Dana, before we get to talk about some of the topics that we discussed that I think are going to be fascinating, whether it's about gender equality or work-life balance, I'd love to hear a little bit about your journey because you've done so many different things from being in advisory boards, to creating organizations, to now coaching leadership to different leaders and leadership styles to speaking engagements. So, who are you? And what motivates you? I am clearly someone with ADD and someone who likes to experiment. And I'm definitely motivated and inspired by making an impact on the world. And so, in a lot of ways, having hired and trained, develop, mentored thousands of people over 20 some years, primarily in Silicon Valley, I feel like I can honestly say, I have made a difference, however, I have a real impatience for action, which is also very Silicon Valley. And so, I would like to help more people universally. And that's the mission I'm on now. What is that? So, what does that even mean, that you're coaching and helping people, whether it's in Silicon Valley or elsewhere, but what does that mean for you to help make an impact by helping others? Yeah. So, one of the reasons I dabble in so many different methods and mediums, having a book now and a podcast; and posting on Instagram; and having a full executive coaching practice with C-Suite members of different kinds of companies, including founder led companies, it gives me a chance to really work in different ways with different people. Some short term, some long term, some quick hit, some really over horizon work and strategy, so I have all these different vantage points of working with individuals and helping them with where they want to go. So, you're looking at all these hundreds or thousands of people that you're saying, "Give me some things that often come up?" What are some things that oftentimes you see pattern recognition and you're saying, ah, I've seen this before; I'm seeing this type of behavior; I'm seeing this type of thing that maybe if I look at that case study, I can bring that in and help? For sure. So, people confuse management with leadership every single day. And there's a clear and distinct difference, and I'm really interested in helping people with leadership whether they're the leader of their life; the leader at work; the leader in their marriage; the leader in their career; they're leader in their education; I really am interested in helping people lead. And so, you've mentioned that book that you've written. So, tell me a little bit about that and how that ties into this work with mentorship and coaching. Yeah. So, I hit my head pretty hard many times, and I guess I'm a slow learner in terms of work-life balance and believing I can have it all by doing it all, all at one time. And of course, women in particular, in Silicon Valley, we have all these great muses who make it look like that's possible. Well, the truth is, it's not. We actually all have limits. And without serious help, serious outsourcing, serious financial wherewithal, etc, etc, it's really not possible to have it all all at one time. And so, what I've really learned and proven over time and now I'm helping others to figure out for themselves and their organizations is that you have to give something up to get what it is you really want. And most people don't even ask themselves, what is it I really want situationally and relatively. Right. So, I mean, when every time, like we say, work life-balance, immediately, the 21st century has given rise to this idea of work life-balance. And a lot of different people are talking about it. Throughout high school, the mantra that my principal had was balance, balance, balance. Everybody's talking about balance. As a go getter myself, I can justify there's 24 hours in a day, sometimes I feel like any minute that I'm doing something, I feel like I'm missing out on that other thing. Talk to me a little bit about your take on this work-life balance. What does it take to really succeed? And what does it mean to be authentic enough with yourself to be able to forgo some other things that maybe the social norm won't really let you? Yeah. So, the social norm is a big part of it. I'm glad you brought that up. So, there's these should: you should do this, you shouldn't do that. And someone also might be someone you emulate or your muse or you're a role model or your mentor and you think, "Oh, they do it this way, so, I should too." Well, one size never fits all. One size only fits one. So, there's five key areas of life that we all share universally and they are: career, family, friendships, community and your own well-being. And so, what happens when you're constantly running like a hamster, sprinting inside of a marathon in this wheel, on this teeter totter, you might hit balance for a moment, but it comes with a really high cost. And then you're usually depleted, exhausted, sick in some cases, like I talk about in my book, and you roll out of the wheel and then you hit reset and you get right back in the wheel. We don't do anything different. And then, you just start running. It sounds like you were alluding to some specific example that I'd love to hear. Sure. I used to get pneumonia one to three times per year. Pneumonia, one to three times per year. Yeah. Like clockwork. Really? Pattern recognition. Predictably, I would know it was coming and still working. So, it was seasonal based on how much work you had. Yeah. And so, okay. So, tell me about this experience. You are getting pneumonia seasonally two or three times a year, you realize that it's part of your work, I'm guessing that you are still working very hard. You're allowing yourself to get pneumonia for quite some time, right? Yes. Years. Years and years. It's like this total type-A overachiever. Single mom at the time, really thought I was striving for something, not realizing, and it's a little corny, but it is the journey it's not the destination. And if you are someone who's very motivated, very high achieving, you know there's no destination. Because there's another mountain to climb anyway. Right. And no one says, "Let me sprint the marathon." and then they win. 100%. I remember vividly my family and we were climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last year and it was one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life. And as we reach the peak, we were telling ourselves the entire eight days, "There's no way we're ever doing this thing again." "This is awful." "We're in so much pain." The second we hit the bus down at the bottom of the mountain, we're like, "Okay. So, Everest next year?" like, what's happening? So, covid hit. So, maybe that's one of the reasons why we didn't go for that. But I can totally feel what you're saying. So, now that you're helping others understand this through the book, what are you saying then? So, what is the solution? Because I know for myself I will not be satisfied if I do less work. All things are not created equal. So, what I suggest is that you actually choose what you want to work on, what you want to spend time on. And the derivative, the delta of the equation is joy, productivity and value. So, if I say to you, you can have all three, that's your triple threat, joy, productivity and value. But you can't do all things equally at all times on any given day, especially inside of a week. I really encourage you to look at your week's production, 168 hours in a week. We all have the same amount of time. You can't buy more, then you might think differently about, Okay, do I want to spend more time in career, more time with family, are career and family my top, and then I'm willing to trade off a little bit on community and maybe friendships. But what about your wellbeing? What about you and taking care of yourself? Because when we come last, there's nothing to give. Right. Right. So then, I mean, these are definitely not things that we can do alone, right? I mean, I don't think that I could really be honest with myself sitting down because there's so many different pulls and so many different things that bring you into a different area. So how do people go about that? So, I have a free quiz on settlesmarter.com/quiz, and it gives you at least a very quick, very simple five minutes or less baseline as to where you are when when no one else is looking. So, you take this quiz. It can be anonymous. It doesn't have to be, but it's not going to get shared with anyone but yourself. And so, depending on how explicit you are with yourself, you figure out where am I actually spending time versus where do I really want to spend time. So, the quiz forces you to make decisions and trade offs and then it gives you a little bit of like a spider graph of where you're at versus where you want to be at. And then there's some tips and tricks and tools and traps to avoid on how to get there. Definitely. Definitely. So, what patterns have you been seeing, at least with the work that you're doing in terms of people's ability to find his balance or if it's helping their work or it's hindering the work? Because obviously, there's so much connectivity here with their inner well-being, their physical health, with the work they're doing. How does it all come together? Yeah. I like to say harmony beats balance every time, and harmony is what you get when you integrate. It's when we compartmentalize or separate ourselves or pretend we're one person at one work and one person at home. And especially in covid, we all see everyone all the time. It's not like I don't see your kitchen behind you right now, I do. And it's not like you don't see my son that I forgot to put away. And if you saw a little lower my camera, you'd be like, "Oh, your credentials are on the ground." Well, that's because my social media, I'd take them off the wall and I have flowers, but I wouldn't normally have flowers. So, we're just revealed we're just ourselves. We're just human. And so when we stop compartmentalizing so much and we start making those conscious trade offs, things start to really shift for us and we can really feel that joy, productivity and value. So, now you were saying like we're entering new reality of where it's not even work-life balance, but the line between life and work is so blurred that in one moment, I'm sitting here and like you said, if we look at the camera a little bit there, I have my dog sitting right next to me. And It's playtime in about five minutes when this is over. So, how do we balance this whole arena? We talk about it. And I would say to you, "What are you going to play with your dog?" "Oh, I'd love to see your dog." And you say, "Oh, can you bring your four dogs in here?" Probably not, because it'd be total chaos. But I mean, even on social media, I'm starting to put my dogs in the shot with me because why not let people really see who I am and what I care about. And that's where rapport building and mirroring an alignment and fully understand each other comes from is finding something of commonality. This is what the number one thing is in dealing with gender issues, with dealing with diversity, equity and inclusion issues, find something in common. Like if you were wearing glasses right now and I'm wearing glasses right now, we could say we both have glasses. Who cares that you're younger than I am, and a guy. And I'm older than you are, and a woman. Who cares? We both have glasses. You don't have glasses. So, that fell apart there, but you know what I mean. Not yet. It's going to happen sooner rather than later. But you're mentioning gender equality or inequality and diversification. Give me your two cents on both those subjects. First, seek to understand before seeking to be understood. That's it. It solves everything. Clarify a little bit. What do you mean by that? Have you heard of the Golden Rule? I have. And I've heard of the platinum rule, which I believe you're going to allude to. Right? I thought I invented the platinum rule. I can't prove it. But I put that into place in my company in 1999. And you were probably way better at research than I am. So, I'm going to actually ask you to trade me this back and tell me, did that come out before '99? If not, I missed the boat. I should have coined that. Yeah, go ahead. No no. What is the golden rule and the platinum rule? The golden rule, which comes apparently from the Bible, I'm spiritual, not religious, however, the golden rule is: Do unto others as you'd have done unto you. The platinum rule is: Do unto others as they'd have done onto them. If you don't know what somebody wants, you need to understand it, before you try to get them to see it your way. And because we're talking Silicon Valley and everything agile, I will add the equation for speed and enhancement of performance is: One plus one equals three. That's the collaborative model which is your ideas and experience and mine together are moving us further faster. Right. That's how collaboration works. But if I were to just really try to push my agenda on you, that's the Golden Rule. So, as you're talking to leaders, C-Suite executives, how do you help them cope with this new era? Obviously, 2020 gave life to a lot of issues that are present not just in United States, but in the world in general. The Me too movement over the past few years, the Black Lives Matter movement. So, what's happening now as you're observing with the leadership scene? And what are some practical things that as a leader myself or my friends or anybody else who wants to become a good leader, what can we do to improve? So, the first thing is something that I'm leading by example on, again, because I firmly believe and I can prove it, that people follow what you do, not what you say. So, I don't do diversity, equity and inclusion training anymore. I'm white and I don't do it. I refer it to people of color, some women, some men, but people of color because it's very hard to coach or teach anything where you can't possibly walk in those shoes. I mean, look, we're all in the same storm, but we're definitely in different boats. And you cannot ever assume you can relate to someone or step in their shoes or be where they've been if you haven't. And it's a really slippery slope. So, for leaders in particular, I had a client this morning say, "We'd love you to do DE and I work." And I said, "No, I'm white. I'm not doing it." "But here's a couple of people to choose from. You pick." "But I love all of them that I'm referring you to." And most of these particular leaders and I'm thinking about recently are also white. And it's sometimes a little bit of an eye opener, they're like, "But I don't understand?" "Like you are a coach." "Why wouldn't you do that work?" And you're a woman, it's like I'm a white woman of privilege. Whether I've earned it or not, it doesn't matter. And so, I think it's really time to really raise this bar. And that means we have to do something. And that's my something. I love it. That is very very inspiring. So, I love to spend the last few minutes that we have to get to know you a little bit better. And what really motivates you? Because over the years, having done so much and being so in tune with the things that make you happy and helping others achieve that fulfillment and understanding of where their joy, productivity and balance in life So, what are you really get excited about? Helping others that want to change the world. So that I'm not feeling so much like I'm doing a lot of this on my own. It's too slow. And you also mentioned that you are a little ADHD with it, with the fact that you're a little impatient to wait for it to happen, right? Always. So, how does that come into play? So, do you work with a lot of different people so that you can experience a lot of different journeys? And by the time you move on to the next journey, the first one will have caught up and got to work? That's a great question. Yeah. There's also a spectrum I've identified. I've actually have this self named protocol about how I coach. There's a guide process and involve process and a master process. Because your life is a gem and it's multifaceted and that's G-E-M. And some people pace through the guide piece, which is training wheels really really fast. Others, it can be years. Some people get through like, Ah, I'm wobbly, but the training wheels are off. That's the evolve process really fast. Others are years. Master is, I'm an autopilot and I no longer have to think about, oh, I'm going to turn left I pushed the blinker down on the car. And that's where I want everyone to get. And then they've probably outgrown me or they can just check in occasionally for maintenance or whatever. And I'm cool with that. And not all coaches are cool with that. I don't need to coach people for life. What does that mean to coach? So, let's go back a little bit and go up 30,000 feet in the air. Why do executives and leaders need a coach? Because the average person thinks of a leader, a big time CEO, we're thinking politicians, "They have it together." "They know everything." "They're moral." "They know exactly what needs to happen." But it's not always the case, is it? No. And it certainly wasn't for me when I hired my first coach, which was when I was helping a founder grow and exit her business. Two heads are always better than one. I've always found that to be true. No one knows everything about anything. And the sounding board, even if you have a fantastic board of directors, sometimes you just need to vent. You need structured venting. And you need a sounding board who then may help you get back to solutions and options. So, I am an avid believer and not just because that's what I do for a living. I had a very serious coach, in my last company before I defected from corporate America. Is it difficult sometimes for leaders to hire a coach and to start the process, feeling that they're maybe giving up some of that ego or control that they had before or they thought they had? That's a really good question. Yes. And I'm really clear. I do what's called a fit call before I coach anyone. It has to be mutual. We have to be on the same page. And if you're not self-aware and if you don't want to shift and you don't want to transform in an accelerated way, I am absolutely not the coach for you. I'm all for healthy ego. but super inflated ego, I'm a pretty tough coach with. I'm pretty good at getting that back in check. Fragile ego, I don't coach people with fragile egos. It's just not my line. What does that mean fragile ego? Sometimes it's a victim thing; it's a super hypercritical thing; it's poor me, look what the world's done to me; but here I am with this pile of money and our big title, like, I don't have the patience for it. Yeah, I'm also a mom. So, that's the mom card. I love it. I love it. Okay. Dana, before we leave, I want to thank you again, first of all, for being so generous with your time and being so flexible with all that's happened. This is definitely very very insightful and very interesting both talking about the work life-balance and mainly, I'm taking from this being honest with yourself. And it's difficult to raise and especially coming in at Stanford and in Silicon Valley, there's so much happening and there's certainly different opportunities, And it's very easy to lose track that there's only 24 hours in the day and it might make sense to even spend five or six hours of them sleeping. My girlfriend definitely is, we're having our daily struggles with that and she needs to win more often. But before we leave, I have to ask you for three words that you would use to describe yourself and why those three words. You won't be surprised. Tenacious, impatient and universally minded. I love it. Why those three? I've always been known even in my last two companies ago, Global Group I was running, they called me "Tenacious D" because I just will not give up. I am such a firm believer that if something needs to be done, I'll get it done. It doesn't matter if it's a mountain that needs to be moved, or a hill. If I believe it, I'll do it. If I don't believe it, I also won't do it as I enter my early 50s here. I won't do it if I don't believe it. And that's new for me. I used to do things I didn't believe in because I thought I was holding the company line or whatever, but not anymore. I just will only do what I believe in and I'm going to do it with a lot of tenacity. I love it. And I have other two. Two more words that I need explanation for. Impatience, it's probably the ADD. It's probably a little bit of Silicon Valley and also boredom. Frankly, my mind works fast and so I get bored and that's usually not good. And finally, the last word. Yeah. Universally minded since I was born. I mean, as long as I can remember, I've been crusading, fighting for the underdog, causes. Kind of grew up that way in Wisconsin where I was raised before I came out here to the great Bay Area. And I do believe that we can make a dent in the universe and do good. I do believe in being socially conscious. 100%. It sounds like that's exactly what you're doing, whether it's by helping others achieve that or by spreading your message. And I definitely hope that this will also help being insightful for others. It definitely was for me. Thank you very much again for being so generous with your time. And stay safe and stay healthy. Same to you and your listeners. Thank you. Take care.
