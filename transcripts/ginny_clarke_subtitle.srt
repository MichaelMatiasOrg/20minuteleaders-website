1
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,240
All right.

2
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,640
Ginny Clark, thank you

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,360
for being on my show.

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,120
How are you?

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,560
I'm doing great, Michael.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,320
Thanks for having me.

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,200
No no.  Thank you

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,560
for being so generous with your time.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,720
I really really appreciate it.

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,200
It's also very early.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,640
So, I really appreciate you

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,840
taking the time for this.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,120
Ginny, I can't wait to learn

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,320
all about your leadership experience,

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,720
your staffing experience

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,400
and the non-linear route that you took

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,720
to get to where you are

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,760
and the things you're passionate about.

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,600
Especially diversity in leadership

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,320
and in recruiting.

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,520
So, Ginny, why don't you take us back

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,080
to the early days.

23
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,200
Where do you come from?

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,880
And how do you get to be

25
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,680
a leadership staff there at Google

26
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,200
after doing

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,480
so many different other things?

28
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,000
Sure, I'm happy to.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,800
It's an interesting story.

30
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,880
I've told it many times.

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,600
But I never get tired

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,440
of hearing it, actually.

33
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,880
So, I hope your audience

34
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,840
will appreciate it.

35
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,000
I grew up in Riverside, California.

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,160
I wanted to be a veterinarian,

37
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,080
so I went to UC Davis

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,440
to study animal science.

39
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,480
And after a couple of quarters

40
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,440
of studying that, I switched to French

41
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,240
and then literally

42
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,320
flip through the catalog

43
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,480
to fortify that.

44
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,120
And so, I landed on linguistics.

45
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,360
So, I got a degree in French linguistics.

46
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,480
I'd always been very active on campus,

47
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,960
worked in the chancellor's office,

48
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,800
peer advising, counseling, all that stuff.

49
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,200
And I took a job at the university

50
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,000
at UC Davis, as a recruiter.

51
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,960
Recruiting for the

52
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,760
University of California system.

53
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,320
I did that for two years.

54
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,800
And my dad really wanted me

55
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,160
to go to law school.

56
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,440
My brother did that, fortunately.

57
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,600
So, I went to business school.

58
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,920
And I go to Kellogg,

59
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,040
I moved to Chicago.

60
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,840
As a Californian, people were like,

61
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,000
"Why would you do that?"

62
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,520
It's cold.

63
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:58,840
I'm like,

64
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,160
Because I want to see [--].

65
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,600
You got their quotes for that, right?

66
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,160
I had the best time at Kellogg.

67
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,080
I was on their admissions committee.

68
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,800
As a first year student

69
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,440
I worked in the admissions office.

70
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,720
I was very active.

71
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,760
And then when I graduated,

72
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,920
they actually offered me a job

73
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,400
in admissions, which is

74
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,720
kind of like recruiting, right?

75
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,120
And I said,

76
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,400
"No no no. I have to go into business."

77
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,640
So, I went into banking

78
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,400
at what was then called first Chicago.

79
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,880
It's now Chase.

80
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,020
I spent a couple of years there and then

81
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,760
I got exposed to commercial real estate

82
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,840
and pivoted into commercial real estate

83
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,680
with what's now JLL,

84
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,120
used to be known as the South Partners

85
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,840
back in the day.

86
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,320
I did that for a few years.

87
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,640
Went over to Prudential

88
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,040
in their real estate investment

89
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,880
management arm.

90
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,080
And then my dad died

91
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,400
in the early '90s.

92
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,240
And that was one of those defining moments

93
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,680
where I just questioned everything

94
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,200
about what I had been doing.

95
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,520
And he had been,

96
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,480
I had amazing parents, both of them.

97
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,200
But he was really my coach.

98
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,600
He called me every Sunday morning

99
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,240
and cheer me on.

100
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,160
And so, after he passed, I just said,

101
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,400
"What is it that I've always

102
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,160
really loved to do?"

103
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,400
And I neglected to mention

104
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,200
that when I was working

105
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,640
for these other companies

106
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,800
that I actually went on site

107
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,640
to recruit for them.

108
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,520
I was not a recruiter,

109
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,280
but that's what I offered to do.

110
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,200
And so, I wrote a book

111
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,160
called Career Mapping.

112
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,360
And in the book I write,

113
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,000
I left a breadcrumbs for myself.

114
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,720
And so, I went back and said,

115
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,360
"I want to be an executive recruit."

116
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,200
I networked my way.

117
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,840
I was pretty good at it.

118
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,000
And I network my way

119
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,880
into one of the largest

120
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,720
executive search firm, Spencer Stuart,

121
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,040
and was there for 12 years.

122
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,240
And became a partner, co-founded

123
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,640
Leader Global Diversity Practice,

124
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,840
worked in financial services

125
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,880
and financial officer practices.

126
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,680
And I left in 2009 to write a book.

127
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,280
I wrote my book, did consulting.

128
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,680
Meanwhile, I have a son.

129
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,800
I got married and then divorced.

130
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,640
So, I've been a mom through all of this

131
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,440
and he's the light of my life.

132
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,640
And so, I did my own thing

133
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,960
for a number of years, about four years.

134
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,040
And then I went back.

135
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,160
I had to get him through college

136
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,920
and I wasn't getting

137
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,080
that Spencer Stuart salary,

138
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,360
so I decided to go

139
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,560
to another search firm that was in Canada,

140
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,360
this is where it gets really interesting.

141
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,480
That firms sold after about two years.

142
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,280
But one of the people that I had recruited

143
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,200
and worked with when the company sold

144
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,440
went to Google.

145
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,320
And in 2016, he called me and said,

146
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,160
"We need help because Google

147
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,280
had recently formed

148
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,960
their internal executive search firm

149
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,320
with people that I knew,

150
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,280
including this gentleman."

151
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,760
So, Ginny, just for context.

152
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
When you say search firm,

153
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,400
is that a company that is dedicated

154
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,240
to helping recruit people

155
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,440
for others? A seach firm?

156
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,680
Yes. A search firm at the executive level.

157
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,120
So, it's not like an agency

158
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,680
where we're trying to place people.

159
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,880
It's quite different.

160
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,440
It's much more

161
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,600
like management consulting

162
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,880
where we get paid a pretty hefty fee

163
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,640
to work with big companies,

164
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,120
mostly large, sometimes small startups,

165
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,680
and to find senior leadership talent.

166
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,000
So, what is the difference

167
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,680
between an agency that places people

168
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,600
in all sorts of positions

169
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,080
versus finding leadership talent?

170
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,360
Yeah.

171
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,560
What is the difference over there?

172
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,560
Well, it's much more of a,

173
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,040
how are we going

174
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,880
to describe this tactfully,

175
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,360
I don't want to impugn

176
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,560
any other agency.

177
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,560
But at the leadership level,

178
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,960
most of the people are passive.

179
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,600
So, it's not as though people

180
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,960
are applying for these jobs.

181
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,760
We get a mandate, we go out,

182
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,320
I would call on big companies

183
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,080
in the Chicago area

184
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,920
and all over the country to say,

185
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,560
"I understand you might be looking

186
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,680
for a chief financial officer."

187
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,240
And so, we'll spend time with them

188
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,440
to understand, well, what does that mean.

189
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,800
This isn't a one size fits all.

190
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,720
And we don't just post it

191
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,320
and wait and see who applies.

192
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,000
But we specifically do research

193
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,360
to identify what are the

194
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,040
other companies that are relevant,

195
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,320
who might those the correct people be

196
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,080
for us to consider to go after them

197
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,000
and woo them and pull them in.

198
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,600
So, it can be a lengthy

199
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,960
for a six month process,

200
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,600
sometimes much longer

201
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,520
to find those senior executives.

202
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,200
And that's what we do

203
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,160
inside of Google as well.

204
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,400
So, I guess it makes sense

205
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,880
because at the end, these are key people

206
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,480
that they could be

207
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,480
a make or break for the company.

208
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,920
A good hire may help the company.

209
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,840
A bad hire make may break the company,

210
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,360
especially the C-level

211
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,600
and above positions.

212
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,760
So, up until that point,

213
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,800
when you were in the two search firms,

214
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,720
were you the one going in

215
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,880
and getting that mandate?

216
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,200
Okay, we need a new CMO

217
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,040
and you're going out

218
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,920
to the market and say,

219
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,840
"Okay. Let me go pull in

220
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,120
the right candidate

221
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,200
until we can find the right one for you."

222
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,400
That's right. I did both things.

223
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,600
So, it's professional services.

224
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,200
And so, as I mentioned,

225
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,520
like in management consulting,

226
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,040
you have to go get the business.

227
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,400
You have to find the client

228
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,760
and then manage the client.

229
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,400
And then manage the engagement

230
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,440
with the, you've got a researcher,

231
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,680
typically, sometimes an analyst

232
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,960
who is doing a deep dive.

233
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,840
What are the companies,

234
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,560
who are the people,

235
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,240
what do we know,

236
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
who we've spoken to before,

237
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,480
this person might be great

238
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,040
in a larger organization

239
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,720
versus this one might be better

240
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,480
in more of a startup

241
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,680
that's got a build to it.

242
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,040
One thing that I'm assuming though

243
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,840
is that C-level executives,

244
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
especially the ones who are

245
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,680
right at the top of the ladder,

246
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,040
they don't go on LinkedIn they say,

247
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm looking for my next opportunity.

248
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,240
Right?

249
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,160
They are in a great opportunity right now,

250
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,440
I might be wrong, but it sounds like

251
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,000
some of the gems are people

252
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,040
that are already have great positions

253
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,640
and so they're not actively looking.

254
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,680
And you have to understand

255
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,440
if they might be interested, right?

256
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
That's exactly right.

257
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,480
And when I started in the business,

258
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,000
LinkedIn didn't exist, actually.

259
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,840
So, now we do leverage it

260
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,000
because there are people

261
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,120
who will let you know

262
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,760
I'm looking for my next opportunity

263
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,920
or conversely people to reach out

264
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,400
to some of the executive search warrants.

265
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,600
I have lots of people

266
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
that will come to me and say,

267
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,200
"Hey, I'm looking for a job."

268
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,800
Which if I can pivot

269
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,040
just so slightly on that point,

270
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,880
that's one of the reasons

271
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,880
I wrote this book, Career Mapping.

272
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,240
It's because it concerned me

273
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,440
that so many people would come to me

274
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,320
as an executive recruiter.

275
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,960
Search firms are working.

276
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,120
They have an exclusive

277
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,880
on whatever that role is.

278
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,960
So it's meeting,

279
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,280
it's not a multiple listing service.

280
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,760
So, I'm not getting a view

281
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,600
of all the open roles for a CFO.

282
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,200
It's whatever my company

283
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,480
might be working on.

284
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,720
So, it worried me that people

285
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,840
would think about it that way.

286
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,640
And I thought

287
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
if I could help folks understand

288
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,520
that they own their careers

289
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,040
and that they should really be the ones

290
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,320
not just going to me as a recruiter

291
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,480
but I'm determining what they want,

292
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,760
then leverage me and others

293
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,440
to help get into that role,

294
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,600
into that company.

295
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,440
Amazing. What is the hardest challenge

296
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,320
of all this?

297
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,280
The most difficult part of this job?

298
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,480
You know what it is,

299
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,520
it's getting my clients.

300
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,200
I have clients within Google

301
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,880
or when I was with Spencer Stuart,

302
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,920
some of them my clients,

303
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,600
to really do an assessment

304
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,880
that is based on competency.

305
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,240
Because a lot of people

306
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,920
want to just default to

307
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,000
well, have they done it

308
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,640
in another company.

309
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,720
Right.

310
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,480
They might have done it really poorly.

311
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,000
And no one wants to say that, right?

312
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,880
Yeah.

313
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,800
But it's my job to tease out

314
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,400
how well did they do it.

315
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,560
And so, I ask competency based questions.

316
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,960
And so, it's not just,

317
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,240
did you do it?

318
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,960
Tell me how you did it.

319
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,840
Give me an example.

320
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,720
But then how do you evaluate that?

321
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,140
Because you're coming in

322
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,800
to all sorts of different businesses.

323
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,560
And I'm sure that within Google as well,

324
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,640
there's all sorts of different areas

325
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,480
which you're not an expert

326
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,120
and you're an expert

327
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,520
on leadership staffing.

328
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,280
How do you go in and help them

329
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,640
map out the competency questions

330
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,000
and evaluate objectively the candidates?

331
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,720
There must be some interaction

332
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,560
with the team that's hiring, right?

333
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,640
Oh, totally. Yeah.

334
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,040
And that's a great question.

335
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,960
At Spencer Stuart

336
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,920
and within Google, we specialize.

337
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,720
So, at Google I lead the non tech team.

338
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,860
So, I have people

339
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,320
who specialize in finance,

340
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,240
in marketing, in sales.

341
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,280
And that's all they do, right?

342
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,120
So, they really do get to know

343
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,600
the senior leadership market

344
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,960
and we stay in the market

345
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,000
identifying who is top talent

346
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,160
that we want to get to know

347
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,680
to the extent

348
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,800
we don't really know them

349
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,240
and have a relationship with them.

350
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,680
It's a relationship business

351
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,040
much more than it is for us.

352
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,360
Yeah.

353
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,000
Definitely.

354
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,640
Talk to me a little bit

355
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,640
about your expertise

356
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,000
in diversity staffing.

357
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,680
It's also something

358
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,520
that you're very passionate about.

359
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,480
What does that mean to you?

360
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,520
A lot of it goes back

361
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,040
to that competency assessment.

362
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,560
Because I think if you think about it,

363
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,920
corporate America

364
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,760
was not open to women

365
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,560
just not that long ago, right?

366
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,560
It hasn't been with Black Lives Matter,

367
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,600
I think we've realized

368
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,000
that a lot of black

369
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,560
and other underrepresented

370
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,560
racial minorities

371
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,520
have not been acknowledged.

372
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,480
We haven't always had

373
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,960
some of the educational requirements

374
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,360
to get in.

375
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
And so, it's important to me

376
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,960
that talent is being assessed fairly.

377
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,640
And that's really the cornerstone

378
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,360
of my efforts.

379
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,640
And that's the infrastructure

380
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,880
that I've sought to build

381
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,040
within Spencer Stuart

382
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,440
and even at Google.

383
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,680
That's really what it is.

384
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,320
And people, they look at me

385
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,440
as an African-American woman

386
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,480
and kind of say,

387
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,240
"Oh, well, you must know

388
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,040
a lot of black people."

389
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,560
"You must know a lot of Latinos

390
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,920
or a lot of women."

391
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,880
And that's not the point.

392
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,480
It's not who I know.

393
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,440
It's just who I can access

394
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,040
and I know how to access.

395
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,560
But I would much rather teach

396
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,600
my recruiters how to access

397
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,320
all of that great talent, right?

398
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,280
So, because that's pretty limited.

399
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,320
I can't know everybody.

400
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,680
That makes no sense.

401
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,560
So, to the extent I've got specialists

402
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,680
and that's what I've been able to do

403
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,040
with Google and a Spencer Stuart

404
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,920
was to build the infrastructure

405
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,800
that says,

406
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,240
"Do your research."

407
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,200
And I insist, our clients insist,

408
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,400
within Google and elsewhere

409
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,720
that we are showing them

410
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,680
a diverse pipeline of talent

411
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,520
that is relevant to the company.

412
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,200
Okay. So, I think

413
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,520
that's really an important point.

414
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,880
This idea that you're showing them

415
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,600
a diverse pipeline of talent

416
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,760
and which feeds them into the decision.

417
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,640
But then, what are the roadblocks

418
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,520
in the system right now?

419
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,560
What are the bottlenecks

420
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,120
that are making it very difficult

421
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,440
to do this properly?

422
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,160
Because obviously,

423
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,960
with Black Lives Matter and everything

424
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,160
that's been surfacing this year,

425
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,440
there isn't equality.

426
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,360
And I'm sure that in most areas,

427
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,400
the pipeline, the top of the funnel,

428
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,640
it still doesn't have the diversity.

429
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,800
So, where is the bottleneck right now?

430
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,160
Some of it is in identifying people.

431
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,200
I want to believe that my recruiters

432
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,840
are doing a great job

433
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,360
and we have metrics and tools

434
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,720
to monitor that.

435
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,040
I can go in and see,

436
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,520
are you meeting talent pool. Right?

437
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,880
We have to know,

438
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,160
you might say, for example,

439
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,600
I think black people in the United States

440
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,840
are roughly 12% of the population,

441
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,640
based on a lot

442
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,080
of the senior leadership roles

443
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,960
that we are seeking

444
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,840
that's not going to be our bogey.

445
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,080
Because we're requiring that people

446
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,440
have a certain level of education,

447
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,520
a certain level of experience.

448
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,800
So, the number is going to be smaller.

449
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,680
I won't tell you what it is,

450
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,640
but it's smaller, okay?

451
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,440
But we still have to identify

452
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,040
in that talent pool.

453
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,480
We're trying to get to a level

454
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,400
that makes sense at a minimum.

455
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,560
Because that's going to ensure,

456
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,480
that's going to give us

457
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,000
a better level of certainty

458
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,240
that we will indeed

459
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,480
increase representation over time.

460
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,600
The bottleneck is really one

461
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,880
of changing hearts and minds.

462
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,360
And so, I'm just going

463
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,880
to be real about this, right?

464
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,800
I can build the best infrastructure,

465
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,520
identify all these people,

466
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,680
put them in front of all

467
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,000
of these hiring managers,

468
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,320
but if they have it in their head

469
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,720
because they haven't seen a person

470
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,040
who looks like me doing what they do

471
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,280
during their experience,

472
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,720
it's hard for them to believe sometimes,

473
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,680
that person is going to be as good

474
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,240
as they need them to be.

475
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,240
And so, we're really trying to overcome

476
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,400
some of these latent beliefs.

477
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm not going to say

478
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,960
these people are racists.

479
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,840
But I am saying that they've got

480
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,040
some deep down,

481
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,080
it's this notion of unconscious bias.

482
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,120
So, now more generally at a high level,

483
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,520
how does the ecosystem deal with that?

484
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,920
Because I'm sure this is something

485
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,160
that's recurring with every company.

486
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,440
And again, I don't think that

487
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,240
it's not necessarily

488
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,320
that people are racist,

489
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,840
it's that people have deep rooted

490
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,280
that through the years they grow

491
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,720
and they're watching certain personas

492
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,440
do certain things,

493
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,080
and then even subconsciously,

494
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,400
they have the cognitive bias

495
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,240
that when they're looking

496
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,960
at a few candidates,

497
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,840
still prefer the ones

498
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,680
that they're more familiar with,

499
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,680
that looks just a little bit

500
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,840
more like them, right?

501
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,080
Like what they're familiar with.

502
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,560
Right.

503
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,800
So, at a high level

504
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,760
how do you tackle that?

505
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,040
It's a part of what we're doing

506
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,200
is really tried to build in

507
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,040
some of the safeguards.

508
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,240
So, my recruiters are trained

509
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,160
to challenge them.

510
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,000
To the extent that they have done

511
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,040
the competency assessment

512
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,600
and they are convicted

513
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,720
that this individual is dequalified.

514
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,400
I have their back to go in and say,

515
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,720
"I got to challenge you."

516
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,200
Right?

517
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,640
There are other failsafes

518
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,000
along the process.

519
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,080
From the HR business partner

520
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,160
to my senior people

521
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,120
who are trying to monitor all of this.

522
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,360
And so, we're doing the best we can.

523
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,640
And there's a ton of training going on

524
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,440
for a lot of these hiring managers

525
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,480
and all these other people,

526
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,040
who are the people, the other interviewers

527
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,240
who are doing the work.

528
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,600
They're not professional recruiters

529
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,160
but they are part of the interview team

530
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,000
that might be working

531
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,120
within for the hiring manager.

532
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,720
We're doing lots of training for them

533
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,960
to understand not just competencies,

534
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,600
but this whole notion of unconscious bias.

535
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,840
Wow. So, you've obviously been

536
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,960
in several industries so far

537
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,440
and you've had various positions

538
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,520
that we spoke about earlier.

539
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,080
Why go into

540
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,160
senior leadership staffing, after all?

541
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,480
Where does this passion come from?

542
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,640
Give me that brief

543
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,320
from the book that you wrote.

544
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,040
Yeah. Well, I think it comes from

545
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,560
watching my dad.

546
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,480
He was a prison warden

547
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,880
and I watched a lot of young people

548
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,720
that were incarcerated

549
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,800
and because he was

550
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,760
with the youth authority.

551
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,040
So, a lot of these people were

552
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,720
as young as I was at one point, right?

553
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,080
And I saw the potential in them.

554
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,480
And I saw how there was systemic racism

555
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,120
in our justice system

556
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,440
that was causing some of them.

557
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,040
And they made bad decisions.

558
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,160
And so, I think there's

559
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,080
a little bit of that

560
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,680
in my mindset that says,

561
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,200
"I see the potential in people."

562
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,040
And so, I've always wanted to be able to

563
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,480
unlock some of the potential that I see.

564
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,280
I was drawn to the senior level work

565
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,360
because I have a passion for leadership.

566
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,320
I know that great leaders

567
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,120
make the difference in an organization.

568
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,640
We've all worked

569
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,960
with not so great leaders

570
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,120
and we felt it personally

571
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,240
and we watched the organization,

572
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,200
suffer might be an overstatement,

573
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,360
but not perform as well as it could

574
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,280
by virtue of the leader, right?

575
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,400
We're seeing that in government.

576
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,880
So, I think that's the other linkage

577
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,720
that I have. I'm really really passionate

578
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
about leadership.

579
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,760
And I think leadership

580
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,280
has a lot of different forms.

581
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,600
And that's part of the passion

582
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,520
that I have around

583
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,760
being an executive recruiter

584
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,440
and helping my clients see

585
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,000
what good, better and best looks like

586
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,240
even if it doesn't look like them.

587
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,880
I love it. So, as I go

588
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,200
on my own entrepreneurial journey

589
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,000
and a lot of my friends

590
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,440
who are watching this as they go

591
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,000
and perhaps to form

592
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,200
companies and businesses

593
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,600
and we'll have to choose the right people

594
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,000
to go on this journey with us,

595
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,760
whether it's at the start or at the end,

596
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,320
what are some of the key insights

597
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
that you've gained over the years,

598
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,160
assessing thousands of candidates

599
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,440
for senior level positions,

600
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,080
what should I be looking for

601
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,520
when I form a partnership

602
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,680
with my co executive directors

603
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,760
or chief financial officers in the future?

604
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,680
What are some things that I can,

605
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,400
as a bad recruiter that I'm right now,

606
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,760
what are some key things

607
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,080
that I can keep in my mind

608
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,680
that you've already learned?

609
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,360
Well, here's a real basic one,

610
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,160
Don't just tap your network.

611
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,080
Because I think that

612
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,240
that can be really limiting.

613
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,720
And frankly, it's a little bit egotistical

614
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,840
to think that I know everybody who's good.

615
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,240
No, you can't possibly.

616
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,320
We live in a vast world

617
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,600
and whatever you're building,

618
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,440
you should be able to tap people

619
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,320
in other countries.

620
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,440
Talent looks like everything.

621
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,720
There are brilliant people

622
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,440
all over the world.

623
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,760
So, make sure that you have

624
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,200
a real talent mindset,

625
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,480
and you appreciate and understand people,

626
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,600
you care about people,

627
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,680
the value they're bringing,

628
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,480
the uniqueness that they're bringing,

629
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,280
that to me is really critical.

630
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,680
And then, more tactically,

631
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,480
when you're assessing people

632
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,000
look for things like,

633
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,960
one of the most important things

634
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,160
that landed with me

635
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,000
after a couple of years

636
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,120
of being at Spencer Stuart

637
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,400
was self awareness.

638
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,280
I'd hear a lot of people saying,

639
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,520
"I did this, I did that."

640
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,880
And they were telling me what they did.

641
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,000
But again, they weren't telling me

642
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,900
how they did it.

643
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,450
How they did it. Right.

644
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,960
It seemed a little tone deaf in terms of,

645
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,400
it was all about me.

646
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,720
And then in contrast,

647
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,280
I would talk to people who

648
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,280
they would own the leadership

649
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,680
and they hold people accountable.

650
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,920
And they were able to talk about

651
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,640
their role in driving impact.

652
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,240
But they also talked about

653
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,840
the compassion, the empathy,

654
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,080
the awareness that they had

655
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,040
for other people,

656
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,240
the awareness that they had

657
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,160
for some of their own shortcomings.

658
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,200
That's a really attractive to me.

659
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,040
Because that to me is at the heart

660
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,840
of what true leadership represents.

661
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,320
I love it. Gi, 20 minutes go by so fast.

662
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,160
But I want to thank you

663
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,840
for being so generous with your time.

664
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,120
Before we leave, I have to ask you

665
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,040
the most important question.

666
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,040
I need three words that you would use

667
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,360
to describe yourself.

668
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,600
And why you chose those three.

669
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,000
Okay. I was a linguist, right?

670
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,440
So, words really matter to me.

671
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,000
I want to go with bold.

672
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,440
I'm pretty fearless and bold,

673
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
much like my father.

674
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,640
I think I got that from him.

675
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,960
I am kind. I have a tough exterior,

676
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,920
but people who know me

677
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,760
know that I'm really really

678
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,400
kind at heart, big heart.

679
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,040
And then the last thing I would say

680
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,960
is awakened.

681
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,400
And by that I mean I have a very deep

682
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,280
and personal spiritual practice.

683
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,880
And I believe that I am,

684
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,360
maybe I should say, awakening.

685
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,520
You're never done.

686
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,720
But I've done a lot of work

687
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,120
to understand who I am,

688
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,880
what my purpose is in the world.

689
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,160
And I want to bring that

690
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,120
into everything that I do.

691
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,760
I love it. Is there room to be,

692
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,200
to have good optimism

693
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,040
regarding diversity and leadership

694
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,720
in the country over the next,

695
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,280
I guess, decade or so?

696
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,520
Yeah. I wouldn't do this work

697
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,000
if I wasn't optimistic.

698
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,200
I mean, there are bumps in the road,

699
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,120
but I think,

700
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,640
Black Lives Matter, for example,

701
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,920
is something that is here to stay.

702
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,440
I think there is an awareness

703
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,640
that there's a lot of work to do.

704
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,040
But I think those of us who get it

705
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,160
and are convicted, we'll see change.

706
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,640
Ginny, thank you very very much.

707
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,840
This was inspiring, truly.

708
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,520
Thank you for your generosity,

709
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,240
for your time, and continue doing

710
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,560
the amazing work that you're doing.

711
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,520
Thank you, Michael. You're a gem.

712
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,480
I really appreciate you.

713
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,360
Thank you. Thank you. Take care.

714
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,160
All right. Bye bye.
