1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,880
And very often data can tease that out,

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,000
we can learn how important price is

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,600
to the customer,

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,960
how important delivery time is

5
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,960
to the customer.

6
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,920
How many, you know,

7
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,400
I think a big part of any marketplace

8
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,040
is understanding that balance

9
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,080
of supply and demand

10
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,760
and how to not just like, forecast it,

11
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,680
but also act against it.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,760
Peter Fishman,

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,280
thank you so much

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,760
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,360
How are you today?

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,880
Doing well.

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,200
Calling from California?

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,080
I'm in San Francisco.

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,680
San Francisco. Lots to cover,

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,880
let's get into it.

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,600
A fascinating, fascinating journey.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,680
I don't know how many more people

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,720
I've had in this show

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,000
that have so many different experiences

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,240
as you've had.

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,200
I even have to open it up

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,760
next to me in order to read it

28
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,320
which I have.

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,080
I don't think I've ever had

30
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,080
to do that before.

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,800
All the way starting

32
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,280
from studying economics

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,720
at a London School of Economics

34
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,080
to doing your bachelor

35
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,440
also at Duke. University of California,

36
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,400
Berkeley, doing your PhD.

37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,760
And then you're moving

38
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,720
to NERA Economic Consulting, Google,

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,840
Philadelphia Eagles,

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,040
the Parthenon Group,

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,400
Playdom, economist in Walt Disney,

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,320
director of analytics at Yammer,

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,880
principal data science manager

44
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,240
at Microsoft,

45
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,080
VP of analytics and growth at Zenefits,

46
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,840
an amazing company.

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,920
Head of analytics at Opendoor,

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,440
chief bacon officer at Bacon Hot Sauce.

49
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,400
You also have to explain to me what that is.

50
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,960
And most recently,

51
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,520
your are chief strategy officer of Eaze,

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,080
a company that

53
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,400
a lot of our friends in California

54
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,360
will know what it's about

55
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,880
and you'll explain to us soon.

56
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,080
And now, the co-founder

57
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,560
of your own company, Mozart Data.

58
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,000
Did I get any of that right?

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,160
Or am I completely off?

60
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,560
It's a nice walk down memory lane.

61
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,360
But, yeah.

62
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,680
I spend a lot of different companies

63
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,200
and a lot of different careers

64
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,240
with some common themes there.

65
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,240
I need about 19 minutes of breather

66
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,880
after reading that list.

67
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,520
Peter, what the hell.

68
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,280
How does a person

69
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,960
go through a list like this?

70
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,400
How does that happen?

71
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Yeah. Well, so,

72
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,640
I think you hit on one thing.

73
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,960
I'm an economist by trade.

74
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,680
So, I did my PhD in economics

75
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,120
in the bay about eight miles east

76
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,520
of where I'm currently living

77
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,600
at UC Berkeley.

78
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,000
It was a really special time

79
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,960
to be in behavioral economics

80
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,160
and applied behavioral economics.

81
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,200
And I was working with a lot of data

82
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,760
and sort of getting that training

83
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,280
and sort of teasing causality

84
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,240
out of a data set

85
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,440
and trying to understand

86
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,760
what's driving certain things

87
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,240
that are happening simultaneously,

88
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,400
is a really interesting tool set

89
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,280
that I learned in graduate school.

90
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,840
And then there was sort of

91
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,000
this really nice movement towards

92
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,960
using more and more and more data

93
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,200
as it became more ubiquitous

94
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,360
in tooling and decision making

95
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,920
and then more and more cost effective

96
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,360
so that organizations beyond

97
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,080
just the giant tech companies

98
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,960
could really use data

99
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,920
to advance their decision making.

100
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,360
And that's kind of been

101
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,720
a common thread of my career.

102
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,280
Right. I mean, you can literally see

103
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,160
the thread as you're transitioning

104
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,280
from being an economist

105
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,360
and an analyst at these companies

106
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,120
to then running

107
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,440
the analytics and growth,

108
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,160
but then transitioning

109
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,280
into strategy in data science.

110
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,080
And then most recently,

111
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,320
the company that you're running now,

112
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,360
Mozart Data, which we'll talk

113
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,280
about it soon,

114
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,520
is really helping companies

115
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,840
analyze the data, pretty much the work

116
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,120
that you've been doing across

117
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,160
about a dozen

118
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,880
of these fantastic organizations.

119
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,600
But, Peter, before we get to Mozart Data,

120
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,680
I'll leave that for the second half.

121
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,800
I'd love to pick your brain

122
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,320
on these nuggets and experiences

123
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,040
from these different companies.

124
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,560
As an economist,

125
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,840
what is the role of an economist

126
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,880
within these tech organizations?

127
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,440
And when I look at also Walt Disney

128
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,400
I think of it as a technology company

129
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,920
like any other.

130
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,400
So, a lot of larger companies

131
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,640
have economists that opine

132
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,320
on the direction of the economy

133
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,040
because so much

134
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,120
of the investment of people

135
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,200
and resources depends on like

136
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,000
basically the bigger

137
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,680
macroeconomic picture.

138
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,240
That's actually not at all what I do.

139
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,000
An economist in my mind

140
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,560
is about using an economic toolset

141
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,880
to understand data.

142
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,040
So, thinking about

143
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,880
kind of some of that training

144
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,440
and some of that

145
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,280
sort of micro economic decision making

146
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,840
and how that impacts

147
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,880
the sort of macrovision of a company.

148
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,320
So, I think a lot of what I do,

149
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,560
though, my title is often economist

150
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,920
and then my training as of to economist,

151
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,600
I'm just an applied statistician

152
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,480
that happens to have taken some

153
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,960
economics classes.

154
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,400
So, I think with that,

155
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,840
Yeah. So, I think there's,

156
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,680
the common theme there is

157
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,760
that economists have a really good way,

158
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,720
in my mind, of thinking about

159
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
causality and prediction.

160
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,120
Of modeling data. Right?

161
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:29,880
Yeah.

162
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,840
Of thinking about kind

163
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,840
of the relationship between two things

164
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,800
that are happening.

165
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,200
And that's because

166
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,560
data used to be a lot smaller.

167
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,440
So, when I did my PhD,

168
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,880
I had a giant giant,

169
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
giant, giant, giant data set,

170
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,440
which was about

171
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,600
half a million observations.

172
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,280
Today, if we saw a data set

173
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,640
of half a million observations,

174
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,480
it would be, you know,

175
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,920
it would be of events that people

176
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,080
might have picked up in minutes

177
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,760
or even less.

178
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,080
So, what used to

179
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,000
sort of count as a giant data set

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,280
is now a very, very trivial data set.

181
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,240
And but because data was small,

182
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,240
you had to think of really clever ways

183
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,680
of understanding the world

184
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,520
and understanding relationships

185
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:16,960
in the data.

186
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,760
And sometimes that meant things

187
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:25,480
like describing a mechanism of behavior

188
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,400
that would sort of account

189
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,880
for these two things,

190
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,200
covariance with each other.

191
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,960
And sometimes that would be actually

192
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,600
sort of these fake experiments

193
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,040
that would be existing in the data.

194
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,240
They weren't real experiments.

195
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,760
They weren't like

196
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,280
scientific method experiments

197
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,840
where you try condition A,

198
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,320
and condition B and see

199
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,160
which one's the winner,

200
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,920
which is so prevalent

201
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,240
in today's A/B testing

202
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,760
and other forms of testing.

203
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,440
But rather, things that were

204
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,920
sort of almost a natural experiment

205
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,960
that would occur in the data,

206
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,040
and you would have small data

207
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,720
and you'd want

208
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,560
to tease out that causal relationship

209
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,240
and think about in a deep way

210
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,560
about in what ways

211
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,520
is this not a real experiment.

212
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,960
So, that training, I think,

213
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,600
really helped as we transitioned

214
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,080
at smaller tech companies

215
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,480
from essentially small data

216
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,960
to almost everybody having big data

217
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,840
due to a lot of cost efficiencies

218
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,080
that have come up on the data side.

219
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,760
That transition from an economist

220
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,520
or an analyst to running analytics

221
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,960
to being head of analytics,

222
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,880
head of growth,

223
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,800
both at Zenefits and then at Opendoor,

224
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,160
how is that transition?

225
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,400
What is the thinking process?

226
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,040
Because to me, it sounds like

227
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,280
it's a little bit even more dramatic

228
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,440
than being an engineer

229
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,160
to a head of engineering.

230
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,000
Here, you're really,

231
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,160
because you keep saying,

232
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,920
economists is the thinking of causality

233
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,000
and what impacts

234
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,720
in modeling data to see trends.

235
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,080
And in one hand, you're modeling

236
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,240
you know, a subset of the data

237
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,880
as in your position,

238
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,120
it sounds to me like

239
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,040
being head of analytics

240
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,840
is now thinking much more broadly

241
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,600
about, okay, where are we headed,

242
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,400
what can we extrapolate from the data,

243
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,480
and what can we request

244
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,680
from the engineering

245
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,440
to provide us for the future?

246
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:03,960
Yeah.

247
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,400
So, my first year at graduate school,

248
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,560
I read Moneyball,

249
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,480
which was for many folks

250
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,080
in the analytics industry,

251
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,400
that was a very sort of defining book.

252
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
It's Michael Lewis's book

253
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,240
on the Oakland A's

254
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,840
and I was going to graduate school,

255
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,880
just one town north of Oakland.

256
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,960
And then ultimately, I became

257
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
sort of the Moneyballer

258
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,200
at the Philadelphia Eagles.

259
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,160
Which is I use my graduate training

260
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,400
to pull out sort of insights

261
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,720
about players and football activity

262
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,600
at the Eagles.

263
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,560
And what I learned there

264
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,240
was really about

265
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,080
impact across an organization,

266
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,040
which is very often

267
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,320
there can be an insight.

268
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,920
Like it's good to go for two

269
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,720
when you're down by 14.

270
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,640
Or, it's good to trade out

271
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,760
of the first round.

272
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,920
Or something that the data clearly,

273
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,320
or it's good to go for it on fourth

274
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,960
and short, whatever it is,

275
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,880
the data might back that out

276
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,520
and might be convincing

277
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,760
in an academic way,

278
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,400
but there's real people.

279
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,600
And you don't get to really run all

280
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,640
the experiments you want

281
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,480
in the real world.

282
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,360
And sort of having

283
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,560
a big impact across an organization

284
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,000
is not just about teasing out

285
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,280
the insights and the data,

286
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,120
but it's also about

287
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,400
kind of driving impact

288
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,320
within the organization.

289
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,680
You're making it happen, right?

290
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,240
Exactly.

291
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,080
So, you had mentioned

292
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,040
a few transitions, right?

293
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,520
I transitioned from being

294
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,160
an individual contributor

295
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,880
at a company like Playdom and Disney,

296
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,040
to being sort of a junior leader

297
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,920
to being a more senior leader.

298
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,000
And all of those have different steps,

299
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,520
different sort of stakeholders

300
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,360
across the organization.

301
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,920
And you do kind of like you said,

302
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,160
for many engineers,

303
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,520
they transition from being

304
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,640
a great engineer

305
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,200
to now having a role

306
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,600
of managing engineers.

307
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,640
And there's just such a different

308
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,200
sort of almost skill set.

309
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,040
And the same is true, of course,

310
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,680
in data and analytics,

311
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,600
which is to say

312
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,880
there's a certain skill set

313
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,560
which involves being able to wrangle

314
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,480
a bunch of data,

315
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,800
being able to clean

316
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,440
or tease insights out of data

317
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,520
or communicate with data.

318
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
I think actually,

319
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,640
I would actually probably

320
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,280
have the opposite because

321
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,800
when you're an analytics leader,

322
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,720
you're trying to tease

323
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,280
those same insights out of the data

324
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,760
and simplify it

325
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,800
at the sort of cross-functional level.

326
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,480
So, a lot of those core skills

327
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,880
you develop as an IC,

328
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,520
though the jobs aren't identical,

329
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,320
a lot of those sort of core skills

330
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,480
translate really nicely,

331
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,639
into the managerial world.

332
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,880
What do you enjoy more? Which of these?

333
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,840
Well, obviously, I've spent the last

334
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,840
sort of decade of my career leading

335
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,640
data teams of different sizes.

336
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,760
I joined Zenefits

337
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,960
where I led the data team

338
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,240
of just me

339
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,280
and then ultimately grew it

340
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,440
to a very large team

341
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,480
as that company

342
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,080
had a really meteoric scale up.

343
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,920
And then obviously,

344
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,800
most recently, before Mozart Data,

345
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,000
I worked at a company Eaze.

346
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,880
Eaze is basically a cannabis marketplace

347
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,600
that matches supply and demand.

348
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,400
It matches sort of dispensaries

349
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,760
with consumers that want those products.

350
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,600
Like any regular marketplace.

351
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:12,510
Except for [--],

352
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,720
because you just give the definition

353
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,840
of what a marketplace does and

354
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,400
it seems so common that

355
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,600
we have a marketplace for everything

356
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,880
from beverages, for food,

357
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,840
for toys or whatever.

358
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,320
Obviously, when it comes to cannabis

359
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,000
and it's still a fresh thing,

360
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,640
in many states, it's still something

361
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,720
that requires explanation.

362
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,440
But I'm sure it was

363
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
a phenomenal experience.

364
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,480
And I've actually been following

365
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,800
the activity of Eaze.

366
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,560
And I love the way

367
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,720
that they're democratizing

368
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,840
and regulating the whole transaction

369
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,520
in the marketplace.

370
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,120
But please continue.

371
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,320
Yeah. So, I mean,

372
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,240
I think actually data plays

373
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,320
a big, big role there.

374
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,520
I think when you think about

375
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,640
a very highly regulated market,

376
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,080
some of the challenges become

377
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,840
actually addressing that regulation,

378
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,440
but doing so really quickly

379
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,120
and understanding

380
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,200
what really matters to your customer.

381
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,160
Right.

382
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,880
And very often data can tease that out.

383
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,040
We can learn how important prices

384
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,600
to the customer,

385
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,000
how important delivery time is

386
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
to the customer,

387
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,960
how many, you know,

388
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,400
I think a big part of any marketplace

389
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,080
is understanding that balance

390
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,120
of supply and demand

391
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,080
and how to not just like,

392
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,680
forecast it, but also act against it.

393
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,640
So, data plays a huge role

394
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,880
in what it does.

395
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,680
And it was a really

396
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,200
forward thinking investment

397
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,680
to build out a strong data capability

398
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,600
because that was, you know,

399
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,960
in some sense it's forward thinking,

400
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,960
on the other hand,

401
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,040
it's just us catching up

402
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,760
to other industries.

403
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,840
You know, you mentioned

404
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,920
sort of food delivery, right?

405
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,720
Looking like many of these

406
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,760
are solved problems.

407
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,920
Transportation, obviously,

408
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,200
the matching of supply and demand

409
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,560
that Uber and Lyft do.

410
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,080
These are all very solve problems

411
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,280
in those industries

412
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,920
and kind of what a key role

413
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,560
data plays at those places,

414
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,120
just being able to map that

415
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,120
to a place with

416
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,840
a ton of regulatory challenges,

417
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,520
this is cannabis, I think is

418
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,920
has been and will continue

419
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,120
to be a really interesting data

420
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,800
and managerial problem for a while.

421
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,280
It's pretty inspiring to me

422
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,600
that a company like Eaze goes in

423
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,040
and takes an economist

424
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,400
and somebody that runs

425
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,960
that heads analytics data science teams

426
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,680
and puts in the position

427
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,080
of a chief strategy officer.

428
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,840
Because it really it is saying something.

429
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,640
It's saying that

430
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,480
we believe that our core strategy

431
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,080
should be guided by data

432
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,400
and by, you know,

433
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,760
the causality and by a team

434
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,360
that knows how to manage this data

435
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,640
and run the analytics.

436
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,640
I don't think that most companies

437
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,040
have necessarily that persona

438
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,240
as the chief strategy officer.

439
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,960
I might be wrong,

440
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,240
but I haven't seen that often.

441
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,440
So, I agree with you.

442
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,280
But I think the trend is that.

443
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,520
So, when you think about

444
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,720
sort of marketing,

445
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,800
you've traditionally seen a lot of CMOs.

446
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,320
But you start to see growth leaders.

447
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,880
Now, growth tends to be

448
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,520
just quantitative marketing, right?

449
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,280
Now, similarly, on the operations side,

450
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,920
when you think about solving a problem,

451
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,760
like, how much demand

452
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,600
do we expect to have

453
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,480
in say, San Francisco

454
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,480
on a Tuesday afternoon at 3PM,

455
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,040
ultimately, this is a data problem,

456
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,360
but it's also a people problem.

457
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,840
You have to have

458
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,400
the right number of people

459
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,280
sort of there to essentially connect

460
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,280
the supply and demand.

461
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,440
So, on the one hand, to me,

462
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,400
that kind of strategy work

463
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,160
is ultimately just data problems.

464
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,360
But you can see operations,

465
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,920
you know, business operations

466
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,800
and operations just looking

467
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,720
more and more like data problems

468
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,680
and having more and more

469
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,320
savvy data leaders

470
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,520
come into leadership roles

471
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,720
in those functions,

472
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,320
as well as the expectation for anybody

473
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,760
that's a COO,

474
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,320
that's a VP of operations,

475
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,920
is that they're comfortable working,

476
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,200
certainly in a BI tool,

477
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,960
but also having a good grasp of data

478
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,120
and what's happening with their data.

479
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,080
And I think that's a perfectly way

480
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,000
into what Mozart Data does.

481
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,160
So, having that grasp,

482
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,040
having that handle on all those different

483
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,840
data and what you can do,

484
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,880
talk to me a little bit about

485
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,720
what Mozart Data does.

486
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,040
And I'm particularly interested to hear

487
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,400
really tangibly, what insights

488
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,960
you've gained from, you know,

489
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,240
these years of both being

490
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,880
the data handler and the data manager,

491
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,520
transitioning into your new baby,

492
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
Mozart Data.

493
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,080
Yeah. Thanks.

494
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,360
And it's actually, like you said,

495
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,480
a very relevant segue.

496
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,720
Because what Dan, my co-founder and I saw

497
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,320
was that there was

498
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,920
this growing population

499
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,560
of folks that were really

500
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,880
competent and comfortable

501
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,240
and itching to use the data.

502
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,480
Like this population

503
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,600
of business analysts,

504
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,440
sales ops, marketing ops,

505
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,440
business ops, heads of analytics,

506
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,720
data analysts that really knew

507
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,160
what they wanted from their data,

508
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,520
had a great understanding

509
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,880
of the business definitions

510
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,720
and understanding of what data

511
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,960
would inform those business decisions.

512
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,360
But getting at that data,

513
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
which is now getting

514
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,280
more and more siloed

515
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,720
by all the different sort of

516
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,240
bevy of tools that people are using,

517
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,800
people are using all these

518
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,560
different SaaS tools and databases

519
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,080
that all basically siloed that data

520
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,040
that it's producing.

521
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,560
So, there's this sort of imbalance

522
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,680
where the demand for data

523
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,360
is growing really rapidly

524
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,120
and the supply, we know where it is,

525
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,600
but it's hard to get at.

526
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,360
You typically have to hire engineers

527
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,560
or data engineers

528
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,920
to essentially enable

529
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,360
that centralization of data.

530
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,240
And this was becoming a problem.

531
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,160
And more and more companies,

532
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,640
they hire folks like me

533
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,480
or like Dan to actually go

534
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,880
centralize that data

535
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
so that it can be used

536
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,640
across the organization.

537
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,760
And a lot of that centralizing work

538
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,440
is in my mind,

539
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,640
sort of road or commodities.

540
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,200
And we would just go

541
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,040
from company to company,

542
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,280
all the ones that you mentioned

543
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,560
in my career, building out either

544
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,360
the same stack

545
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,040
or something very, very similar,

546
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,760
sort of centralizing everything

547
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,000
in a powerful data warehouse,

548
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,640
a column or data warehouse.

549
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,080
And we decided

550
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,360
to essentially build that

551
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,480
as a service so that really anybody

552
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,120
that's really comfortable with data

553
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,200
and data thinking

554
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,960
and sequel could really

555
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,880
do the data cleaning

556
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,320
and the extracting,

557
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,400
loading and transforming of the data

558
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,480
that needs to be done

559
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,640
with their skill set,

560
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,800
with their understanding

561
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,840
of the business definitions,

562
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,000
with their understanding

563
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,320
of their technologies,

564
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,320
and not needing Python, Jinja,

565
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,160
DAGs, custom languages

566
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,320
to really make all of the work

567
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,560
that is actually quite straightforward

568
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,160
what data you need

569
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
making that available

570
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,480
without kind of a big data engineering.

571
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,160
So, what we try to do is

572
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,280
be the easiest way

573
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,960
to onboard sort of a modern data stack.

574
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,200
That's so interesting.

575
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,720
So, would an interesting

576
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,360
workflow be that led to that

577
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,840
there's somebody in marketing

578
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,400
that has a ton of data

579
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,280
and CSVs that they get

580
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,560
from somewhere within their company.

581
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,400
They load that data to you.

582
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,520
You help automatically cleaning it

583
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,960
and starting to see some causality

584
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,920
and some models out of them

585
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,840
and provide them a framework

586
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,160
for analyzing the data

587
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,840
without having to use things

588
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,240
like code or data science.

589
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,920
Well, so, I want to back it up one step.

590
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,760
So, you've already gotten to a point

591
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,600
where the marketer

592
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,600
has that data in CSV form.

593
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,800
I want the marketer to be using

594
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,360
the tools that they're comfortable in.

595
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,320
Maybe that's HubSpot

596
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,880
or maybe they're using Salesforce

597
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,200
or maybe they're using Google ads

598
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,680
or Facebook ads,

599
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,760
and we want to be able for them

600
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,160
with just the credentials,

601
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,840
just the rights

602
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,440
to be able to use that data,

603
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,280
to be able to extract and load that

604
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
into a central data warehouse.

605
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,200
Now, they might also have CSVs

606
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,360
or G-Sheet or something like that,

607
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,240
which they also want

608
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,240
to put in their data warehouse.

609
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,160
They want to combine

610
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,680
and clean this all and transform it all

611
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,320
in their data warehouse.

612
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,880
And they can do that

613
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,560
with a platform like Mozart.

614
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,800
Now, going all the way to the end,

615
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,440
we are actually not in the BI space.

616
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,320
So, we don't give you the tooling

617
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,960
to go graphically represent your data

618
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,200
and tell a story with your data.

619
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,040
Which is, like I mentioned,

620
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,760
from my time with the Eagles

621
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,040
and then throughout my career,

622
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,680
a really important part

623
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,560
of what a great data person does,

624
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,520
they tell a story with the answer.

625
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,280
And that's not really what we provide,

626
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,840
that we actually really like giving

627
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,440
customers a good push in the back

628
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,720
in terms of these are core tables,

629
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,640
these are core piece

630
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,000
of analysis that like

631
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,680
we see a lot of folks in the space

632
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,760
that you're in doing.

633
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,720
So, we like to give people frameworks

634
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,720
for doing the cleaning,

635
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,320
for building their analysis.

636
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,040
But really, what we want to do

637
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,040
is empower you to get to that point

638
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,840
of a central warehouse

639
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,960
where you can start joining data

640
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,800
from different tools,

641
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
and we want to really make that

642
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,000
available to anyone.

643
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,360
I love that. Peter, before we go,

644
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,200
I have to thank you for being generous

645
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,280
with your time

646
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,760
and for joining me in this show.

647
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,160
I have two last questions

648
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
that I have to ask.

649
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,640
First of all, chief bacon officer

650
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,920
of Bacon Hot Sauce.

651
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,480
Now, you've been there for 10 years.

652
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,200
So, I'm guessing this is going to,

653
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,040
it's a little different from the rest.

654
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,200
Yeah.

655
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,760
So, Bacon Hot Sauce

656
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,560
was a real passion project.

657
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,440
So, actually, Dan,

658
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,600
the co-founder of Mozart and I,

659
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,200
started this Hot Sauce company

660
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,600
10 years ago.

661
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,720
We had the idea

662
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,280
that the two best things in the world

663
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,400
were bacon and hot sauce,

664
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,840
and we had to combine them

665
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,840
and then we made that a reality.

666
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,680
And then ran that business for 10 years.

667
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,000
And actually, we ended up selling

668
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,720
the business and starting Mozart.

669
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,880
So, there's like sort of like a lie,

670
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,240
which is to say, like

671
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,320
there's a story about Slack,

672
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,600
which is they were a tiny speck,

673
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,040
and then suddenly, you know,

674
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,920
that wasn't going where

675
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,800
they wanted it to go.

676
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,040
So, they decided to pivot

677
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,320
into their chat app.

678
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,040
We sort of tell the story

679
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,000
it's only partially true,

680
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,600
which is we had a hot sauce company

681
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,400
that was failing

682
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,840
and that we needed to pivot.

683
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,200
So, we pivoted into

684
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
this Mozart Data company,

685
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,960
which is true in so far as that

686
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,560
it's Dan and I are

687
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,320
working on it together,

688
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,680
but we're sort of data

689
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,320
people at our core,

690
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,000
but also bacon and hot sauce people

691
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,800
also at our core.

692
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,520
And Peter, I have to say that

693
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,600
I feel like I've wasted 20 minutes.

694
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,400
Because I want to go back

695
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,280
and just talk about

696
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,520
this bacon hot sauce company.

697
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,920
But we'll leave that for another episode

698
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,800
in another cycle.

699
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,720
Before we leave, Peter,

700
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,560
I need three words

701
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,720
that you would use to describe yourself.

702
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,000
Sure.

703
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,800
So, number one is like, efficient.

704
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,880
So, I love when people are able

705
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,840
to make great 80-20

706
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,280
like trade offs.

707
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,840
There's so much of the insight

708
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,160
I think, comes in kind of just the setup

709
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,040
and understanding of it.

710
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,560
I guess another one that I sort of,

711
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,040
you know, as a single word,

712
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,080
it's sort of like a pay-it-forward.

713
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,280
But I think one of those,

714
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,720
There is hyphens in there.

715
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,560
Yeah. Sure.

716
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
So, pay it forward

717
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,840
is what I found in the valley

718
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,080
is that so much of my growth

719
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,880
can be attributed

720
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,440
to folks that I've worked with,

721
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,360
both that were above me,

722
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,480
that worked for me,

723
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,720
and that were actually,

724
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,240
I guess, horizontal to me.

725
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,640
So, I think when you invest

726
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,800
in having those people understand

727
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,640
either data

728
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,240
or how you're thinking about the data

729
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,200
or how you're thinking about the problem

730
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,360
that pays huge dividends.

731
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,600
Then last year, we have a

732
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,560
big mentality around growth

733
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,880
at Mozart, professional growth,

734
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,760
personal growth, all of those things.

735
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,800
And I think growth, obviously,

736
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,560
my career at parts was working

737
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,920
in sort of growth marketing,

738
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,920
but I think growth is also another one

739
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,280
that's a little bit counterintuitive.

740
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,800
Which is ,the more someone grows

741
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,000
it doesn't distract them

742
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,280
from the core of what they're doing.

743
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,320
It actually, there is no substitution.

744
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,360
It actually just adds more and more

745
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,000
and more richness to their capabilities

746
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,440
and also their willingness

747
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,560
to invest in something.

748
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,720
So, sort of growth ties nicely

749
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,520
with pay it forward.

750
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,400
Peter, thank you very much.

751
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,080
This is wonderful.

752
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,440
Congratulations on your recent

753
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,660
four million dollar seed round

754
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:03,080
for Mozart Data.

755
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,040
I told you before

756
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,160
that I'm already upset

757
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,280
that we did this

758
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,480
a couple of weeks too late

759
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,760
because I wish

760
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,360
we could have gotten in there.

761
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,760
But really, congratulations.

762
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,400
And I love your take on things.

763
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
And particularly I get inspired

764
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,320
by people's journeys

765
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,080
where they become,

766
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,400
they experience

767
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,960
these growing pains over,

768
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
over shared experiences,

769
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,520
eventually culminating

770
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
in this aha moment

771
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,600
that they have internally

772
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,920
and then bring it out to the world.

773
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,680
So, thank you for the

774
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,960
inspiration for that.

775
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,720
And stay safe and stay healthy.

776
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,200
Same to you.

777
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,160
I enjoyed it.
