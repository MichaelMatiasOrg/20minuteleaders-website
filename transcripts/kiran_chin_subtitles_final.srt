1
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,400
Wonderful.

2
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,360
Kiran Chin, thank you

3
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,080
for being on my show.

4
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,800
How are you?

5
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm well, Michael.

6
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,920
Thank you for having me.

7
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,280
Appreciate it.

8
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,880
I am very excited to have you.

9
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,120
I came in here thinking

10
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
we're gonna talk primarily

11
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,080
about consulting and MKA insights

12
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,440
and MBA and finance,

13
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,320
but we're gonna start off

14
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,120
with education

15
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,800
because the first thing

16
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,440
that you told me is that

17
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:02,920
this is something

18
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,680
you're particularly passionate about

19
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,680
and intertwined with your passion now

20
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,600
for helping bridge gaps in education.

21
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,800
I'd love to tie this also

22
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,080
to your personal journey

23
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,600
and to understand a little bit about

24
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,840
where you come from

25
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,040
and sort of the non-linear career pathway

26
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,520
that you took to becoming the CEO

27
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,520
of the very successful MKA Insights.

28
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,200
So Kiran, who are you?

29
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,000
Well I don't know if 20 minutes

30
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,200
will suffice for a life history here, but I'll-

31
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,120
It never does, but we'll try.

32
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,600
So, education is absolutely something

33
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,800
I'm extremely passionate about.

34
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,600
It's one of my core tenets.

35
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,040
It has molded me.

36
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,960
It has driven me,

37
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,000
continues to drive me today.

38
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,680
I'm a constant learner.

39
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,840
I want to absorb as much knowledge

40
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,400
as I can.

41
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,720
I ask a ton of questions,

42
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,360
and that's been me

43
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,520
for as long as I can recall.

44
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,960
And it really started

45
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,960
a very long time ago.

46
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,200
When I came to this country,

47
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,320
I was about five years old.

48
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,360
My parents immigrated here from Pakistan.

49
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,000
They had six children at the time.
- Wow

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,040
They had a seventh child

51
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,000
that was born in the states.

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,640
So, I'm one of seven.

53
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,080
Where in Pakistan, by the way?

54
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,480
So, we moved around a little bit,

55
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,880
but Hyderabad and Karachi

56
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,000
are kind of the two towns

57
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,040
that my parents hail from.

58
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,800
Wow.

59
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,720
And my parents

60
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,440
always brought us here and said,

61
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,840
"There are no opportunities

62
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,720
or few opportunities in Pakistan,

63
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,080
but in America, with an education,

64
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,200
you can be anything

65
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,240
and do anything you want to be."

66
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,440
The American dream.

67
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,800
American dream. True.

68
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,560
And I'm five years old.

69
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,680
I'm listening to my parents

70
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,200
not fully realizing what that means

71
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,720
until, I realized very early on

72
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,800
and I have high logic centers.

73
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,080
I think how does this work.

74
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,880
Those are the questions that drive me.

75
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,840
And so I would ask,

76
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,560
"Well, why does the grass grow?

77
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,040
How does the sun revolve

78
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,720
around the earth?"

79
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,320
And the responses I got

80
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,360
were very religious

81
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,800
because my parents are very conservative.

82
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,960
And they would say,

83
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,240
"Well, God does this and God does that."

84
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,840
And I would go,

85
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,080
"Well, I don't know."

86
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,080
like I think there's ... here.

87
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,080
And so I, at a very early age,

88
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,160
was six years old.

89
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,920
By six years old,

90
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,840
I knew I was born into the wrong family.

91
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,600
I was very scientific oriented,

92
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,280
wanted to know how the world works,

93
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,560
and the responses I was getting

94
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,520
wasn't feeding

95
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,960
that intellectual curiosity.

96
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,040
And I remember my father said,

97
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,560
"I brought you here for an education.

98
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,520
With an education,

99
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,800
you can do anything, be anything."

100
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,240
and I held on to that.

101
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,560
I believed it.

102
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,640
I started accelerating in school.

103
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,320
I had just a natural ability.

104
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,440
I love academics.

105
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
I love books.

106
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,760
So, I accelerated,

107
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,840
and I knew that

108
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,320
that was my ticket out of there.

109
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,640
It wasn't just the religious household

110
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,240
that I butted heads with.

111
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,440
I grew up six, seven kids

112
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,320
in a really impoverished part of town

113
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,640
just outside of Philadelphia.

114
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,200
We did not have a lot,

115
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,760
and I knew that education

116
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,320
was my way out of there

117
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,080
for multiple reasons.

118
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,520
And so, I applied myself

119
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,120
and put myself through school

120
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,720
and continued to focus on education,

121
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,040
and that's allowed me to make the jumps

122
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,320
that I have had in my career

123
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,920
and allowing me to be where I am today.

124
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,640
So, education is a core tenet of mine.

125
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,000
I truly believe that with education

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,640
you can do and be anything you want to be,

127
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,320
but you have to believe in it.

128
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,520
Wonderful. I have a few quick questions.

129
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,320
So, out of the seven children,

130
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,120
where are you,

131
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,720
and you're definitely not the youngest,

132
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,280
but where are you in the line?

133
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,000
I am the exact middle child.

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,960
I'm the fourth child in the social order.

135
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,760
Wonderful.

136
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,120
And your favorite subjects in school?

137
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,200
Well of course science and math.

138
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,360
So, I'm a STEM child growing up.

139
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,640
There's order, it's tangible,

140
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,080
it's ...

141
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,120
It's predictable.

142
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,040
It's predictable. You know it, right.

143
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,480
There's always an answer to it.

144
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,400
I always struggled with history

145
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,120
and writing,

146
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,520
but reading was also a favorite of mine,

147
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,080
so I was an absolute bookworm growing up.

148
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,160
Wonderful. Okay.

149
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,360
So, you go through college.

150
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,480
Your bachelor's, your master's,

151
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,440
and then MBA.

152
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,760
And then, what's your thinking process?

153
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,000
So, where do you go from there?

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,520
Because you both studied finance

155
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,680
as a masters, but you've done

156
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,000
also your business degree.

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,520
So, what's next for you?

158
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,360
So, I think this goes back

159
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,040
to why I think education

160
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,840
and exposure to young children

161
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,280
is one of my biggest passions in life,

162
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,000
because when I was an immigrant child,

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,040
I did not know what the opportunities

164
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,800
were in front of me.

165
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,000
So I was either going to be

166
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,080
a doctor or a lawyer,

167
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,720
and those were the options.

168
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,760
And when I was asked,

169
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,760
"Well, what are you going to do?"

170
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,240
The follow up question is,

171
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,920
"Well, what do you like doing?"

172
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,080
and I like helping people.

173
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,640
But that isn't an exact career.

174
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,840
But I'm also great at science and math.

175
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,960
And so, the two of what you like to do,

176
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,560
combined with what are you good at,

177
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,000
was never something that at a young age

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,760
I understood very well. So I said,

179
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
"Well, I want to help people,

180
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,400
but what are those careers?"

181
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,440
And so I'm finding now my journey,

182
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,000
as I reflect back,

183
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,640
that remains true to who I am.

184
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,360
I want to remain helping people,

185
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,120
but I'm also really good

186
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,120
at science, math, and solving problems.

187
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,520
So where I am today,

188
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,920
I solve people's problems for a living.

189
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,360
And it took me

190
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,120
about 20 years after business,

191
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,200
after undergraduate,

192
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,400
to come to that realization.

193
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,760
I like the uncertainty.

194
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,040
I like the chaos.

195
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,200
I like being the first one

196
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,040
in a problem or a challenge

197
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,010
trying to figure it out.

198
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,760
Okay. So, same place that we left off.

199
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,880
We left off talking about STEM.

200
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,080
We just finished

201
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,320
your finance and business degree.

202
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,400
And I was asking,

203
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,040
where are you headed at that point?

204
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,960
Okay. So, wrapping up

205
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,200
my finance and business degree,

206
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,720
I ended up getting a job

207
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,240
out of business school

208
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,720
with a life sciences tools company.

209
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,520
And ended up doing M&A work for them.

210
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,240
And it wasn't what I thought

211
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,000
I was going to do,

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,680
because I graduated in 2009,

213
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,200
which was just at the height

214
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
of the housing bubble bursting.

215
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,960
And so there was a flood

216
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,640
of financial professionals ...

217
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,160
And prior to going to business school,

218
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,440
I had a very different career

219
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,080
than post business school.

220
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,120
So, I worked in politics

221
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,120
for about three and a half years.

222
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,200
I earned a degree in economics.

223
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,640
And it's not the degree

224
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,920
that I thought I was going to get

225
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,880
being a STEM child.

226
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,200
I thought I was going to go

227
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,880
into some kind of medical field,

228
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,600
and unfortunately, that did not work out.

229
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,520
The bookworm that was removed

230
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,880
from her very conservative household

231
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,920
where we weren't allowed to do very much,

232
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,400
transplanted over to Southern California

233
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,000
with the beaches

234
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,480
and just the beautiful weather.

235
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,320
And for the very first time in my life,

236
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,480
I experienced life

237
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
for the very first time.

238
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,120
So, I don't know if I would take

239
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,200
any of the life experiences back.

240
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,400
I would certainly go back

241
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
and tell my younger self

242
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,960
to pay more attention

243
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,720
to the organic chemistry

244
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,960
and the biology books

245
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,520
and maybe try and finish out

246
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,560
that scientific degree,

247
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,520
but that was not in the cards for me.

248
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,400
And I think my life where it is today

249
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,720
is just right where it should be,

250
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,520
so I think I'm okay.

251
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,880
But I thought I was going to be a doctor.

252
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,920
That academically was not

253
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,760
in the cards for me.

254
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,120
I switched focus

255
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,200
to be an economics degree.

256
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,280
I didn't quite know what to do with that.

257
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:22,400
I was fortunate that at Career Day at USC,

258
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,760
which is my alma mater,

259
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,200
I came across a lobbyist.

260
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,760
I found myself interviewing for jobs

261
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,160
at LA County Mayor's office,

262
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,960
at the LA County

263
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,760
Board of Supervisors offices,

264
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,080
and the do gooder in me

265
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,080
wanted to be a part of something.

266
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,360
If it was not in medicine,

267
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,160
then maybe it was in politics.

268
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,720
And so, I started working

269
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,800
for a very highly regarded

270
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,680
Latina politician in LA County.

271
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,040
And it was really tough going

272
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,080
because she had high expectations

273
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,800
and very few people

274
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,600
were ever meeting those expectations.

275
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,880
But it was such a great

276
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,920
learning environment.

277
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,600
I have to tell you,

278
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,320
there were a lot of cuts and bruises

279
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,480
having worked in that office,

280
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,920
but I learned a tremendous amount.

281
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,600
But at the end of the day, I realized

282
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,920
it was disconnected

283
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,080
from my STEM background.

284
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,640
I had a passion for the sciences.

285
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,680
It was just, it didn't feel

286
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,000
like what I should be doing.

287
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,240
And so I wanted to go back

288
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,160
to business school.

289
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Find a way-

290
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,680
But you spent

291
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,040
a pretty long time there, right?

292
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,040
It wasn't just a month or two.

293
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,800
Right. Right.

294
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,720
I was there for about

295
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,400
three and a half years.

296
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,680
Great experiences.

297
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,800
At the tender age of 21, 22 years old

298
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,720
I was managing a $750,000,000

299
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,800
LAC/USC hospital construction project.

300
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,960
Co-managing that

301
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,680
with the Urban Planning Deputy.

302
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,840
I was put in leadership roles

303
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,400
for urban planning projects,

304
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,160
economic redevelopment.

305
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,520
So, I was in a way helping the community

306
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,600
and the constituency.

307
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,360
It just wasn't what I thought

308
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,040
it was going to be,

309
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,880
but I did see the impact

310
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,040
of the work we were doing.

311
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,880
But again,

312
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,320
disconnected from the sciences.

313
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,000
So, it was important for me to go back

314
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,600
and feel reconnected to science and math.

315
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,280
And so, thinking back to business school,

316
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,000
Hey, I want to go to business school.

317
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,240
Use that to leverage

318
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,720
into a career in science and math.

319
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,640
And again, don't know

320
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,560
what that looks like.

321
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,480
I just know I'm gonna get

322
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,640
to the next rung and figure it out

323
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,960
when I get there.

324
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,200
And when I did-

325
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,880
So right before we continue to that part.

326
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,640
You're at the intersection,

327
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,920
you're at a sort of a junction in life

328
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,400
and you're saying,

329
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,320
Yes, I had a wonderful time here

330
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,880
working on these incredible projects,

331
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,840
but I feel that my heart

332
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,640
is someplace else.

333
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,280
My true passion and my progression

334
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,200
throughout my career

335
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,440
is gonna be someplace else.

336
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,920
I'm curious about this decision

337
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,760
to go to business school.

338
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,160
I mean obviously business school

339
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
it's a wonderful experience,

340
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,560
but being at university myself,

341
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,440
it is a dilemma that a lot of people have, right.

342
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,280
Business school,

343
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,160
it's not just the financial burden of it,

344
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,000
but it's also the time

345
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,120
that you spend on it.

346
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,560
And a lot of people are wondering

347
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,800
what's the right path.

348
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,720
And for you, that was your path

349
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,160
as you were transitioning careers.

350
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,040
Walk me through a little bit

351
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,600
about the thought process back then

352
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,320
of why you enroll in business school

353
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,240
three and a half years

354
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,280
after you're in the market.

355
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,440
Well, for me, it was a journey

356
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,760
because I was not very happy

357
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,920
in the political role.

358
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,640
Because again,

359
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,520
very disconnected from my core.

360
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,600
And so, I was trying to find

361
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,520
alternative roles

362
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,720
and it just was not working out for me

363
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,640
because every conversation

364
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,920
or informational discussion I had,

365
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,440
always came back to the fact

366
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,280
that they did not understand

367
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,800
how a job in politics and government

368
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,040
translated into a job

369
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,960
in the private sector

370
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,120
or in banking or anything of the sort.

371
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,320
And the feedback that I was getting

372
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,000
from a lot of the individuals

373
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,720
I spoke to said,

374
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,200
"You know what?

375
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,320
Maybe you should try to go back

376
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,000
to business school and get a degree

377
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,760
where you're academically trained

378
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,000
in the principles of

379
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,440
how a business is run,

380
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,200
how businesses operate.

381
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,280
And that will allow you to at least

382
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,680
get a foot in the door."

383
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,400
And at that point, I said,

384
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,320
You know what?

385
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,680
I'd like to try that.

386
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,760
I'm hungry. I'm a hard worker.

387
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,600
I'm going to do anything that I can do

388
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,000
in order to get my foot in the door,

389
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,680
because once I get there,

390
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,440
I know I'll be fine.

391
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,800
And so, that confidence

392
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,600
carried me through the guidance

393
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,240
and advice of many people

394
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,440
who carried me through.

395
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,880
And that's how I find myself

396
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,680
going to business school.

397
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,520
So, now you're running a company,

398
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:40,960
MKA Insights.

399
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,800
Tell me a little bit about

400
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
what you're trying to do there

401
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,520
and how you're now

402
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,240
bridging that gap with STEM

403
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,320
and your other passions to also helping.

404
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,620
Well so, excuse me.

405
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,930
MKA Insights

406
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,640
is a management consulting firm

407
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,120
which for those who don't know,

408
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,600
and I didn't know, I think I arrived

409
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
at this point in my life late,

410
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,560
it's a consulting firm that works

411
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,880
with managers, business leaders,

412
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,360
executives, business owners.

413
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,080
And the way that I describe it is

414
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,200
we like to work with people

415
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,400
at the top of the pyramid

416
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,120
helping them solve

417
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,000
their toughest business challenges.

418
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,720
So, do you want to go to market in Europe?

419
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Do you want to launch

420
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,320
a disruptive new technology?

421
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,600
Do you want to expand in Asia Pacific?

422
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,720
Those are the kinds of business challenges

423
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,480
that people at the top of the company

424
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,280
are often faced with,

425
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,080
and those are the kinds of things

426
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,200
that we enjoy doing.

427
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,800
Now, we also have a very specific focus

428
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,880
or industry focus

429
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,360
coming from the sciences.

430
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,120
We love technology.

431
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
We love science.

432
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,920
And we like to stay with the high science,

433
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,040
high technology vertical.

434
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,600
So, we work with

435
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,360
clinical diagnostic companies,

436
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,320
medical device companies,

437
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,720
life sciences tools,

438
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,640
biologics manufacturing tools,

439
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,040
cell and gene therapy.

440
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,840
So, those are kind of the verticals that we serve.

441
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,000
And again, whatever business challenge

442
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,600
that they have, we love taking on.

443
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,840
So, that's what we're working on

444
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,760
as a company.

445
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,400
And it stays focused with STEM.

446
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,640
And the great thing about it is

447
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,960
we get to experience the innovation

448
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,400
that this industry has to offer,

449
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,400
and it really fuels us and keeps us going.

450
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,360
We are part of

451
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,280
some fantastic conversations,

452
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,080
whether it's covid-19 related,

453
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,560
whether it's STEM

454
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,120
and cell and gene therapy related.

455
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,120
And as of late, we've started getting

456
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,840
conversations and dialogues with company

457
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,520
in the aerospace sector.

458
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,360
And so, we're really, really excited

459
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,600
about the kinds of innovation,

460
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,280
the boundary pushing technology

461
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,040
and thought that is occurring

462
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,080
in the high science,

463
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,920
high technology sectors that we serve.

464
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,760
So, we're really excited about it.

465
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,520
Now, are these long term engagements,

466
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,880
short term engagements?

467
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,360
Just paint me a picture a little bit

468
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,400
of what is tangible part work

469
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,840
that you can do?

470
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,840
So, I'm coming in.

471
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,200
Let's say I'm a biologist

472
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,360
and I have a company

473
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,280
that I'm offering some product.

474
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,360
And I also want to now offer it to Europe,

475
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,680
not just the United States.

476
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,840
So, I assume that I would be able

477
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,560
to come to you and say,

478
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,840
"Listen, I'm wondering about

479
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,560
what is the best way to do this."

480
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,240
or "I'm having trouble

481
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,280
penetrating the market.

482
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,440
Maybe you can help me price

483
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,200
or you can help me think

484
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,600
through my product better."

485
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
Are those the types of things

486
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,800
people come with?

487
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,560
Exactly.

488
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,400
So, that is an exact case study

489
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,760
that we did

490
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,800
or exact engagement that we did.

491
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,760
So, we work with companies

492
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,640
that want to expand into Europe.

493
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,920
And so, we'll do an evaluation

494
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,160
of their current footprint.

495
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,080
We'll do our own market research,

496
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,040
discovery, look at their capabilities.

497
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,800
I mean, we ask a ton of questions

498
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,080
and that goes back to

499
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,240
one of the core tenets

500
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,160
which is education.

501
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,360
I mean we can't, in good conscious,

502
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,360
put together a plan that says

503
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,320
"You should do this"

504
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,240
without knowing as much as we can

505
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,880
about the current industry dynamics,

506
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,960
the regional dynamics, the company,

507
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,440
its strengths and capabilities,

508
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,080
its limitations, management challenges,

509
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,840
and the like.

510
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,120
And once we get that

511
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,000
holistic picture developed,

512
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,280
then we have an iterative discussion

513
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,040
with those business leaders and say,

514
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,720
"Hey, we think this is the direction

515
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,000
that's right for you guys.

516
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,040
Is that in line with what you would like

517
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,800
to see happen?"

518
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,080
And it isn't a plan

519
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,240
that we concoct in isolation and say,

520
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,080
"Go, do this."

521
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,040
and it's completely unrealistic.

522
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,520
We do it in partnership with our clients

523
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,760
who need to own the management decisions

524
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,600
once we leave,

525
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,040
because the whole goal

526
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,640
of working with our clients

527
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,320
is to enable them and empower them

528
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,840
to do this long after we leave.

529
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,360
Because paying a consultant

530
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,160
to be a part of your management team

531
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,960
can become extremely expensive.

532
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,880
And so, we don't want to do that

533
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,360
to our clients.

534
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,480
We want to have an impact,

535
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,520
we want to have a measurable impact,

536
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,480
and we want to teach them a few things

537
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,240
along the way that they should retain

538
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
as part of their own

539
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,120
business growth journey.

540
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,520
Wow. Okay. That's just incredible.

541
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,720
Quick question before we have to wrap up

542
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,640
and I'll ask the most important question,

543
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,160
but how do you retain knowledge

544
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,040
within an organization like this?

545
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,360
So, you said before a case study

546
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,120
and then you changed it

547
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
to an engagement,

548
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,360
but really, these are case studies

549
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,960
that at the end you go to business school

550
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,680
and you study these things as case studies

551
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,480
about how do you take a certain problem

552
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,280
and you tackle it through

553
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:30,960
different directions

554
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,720
and you see what the optimal outcome is.

555
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,280
But how do you maintain that knowledge

556
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,120
within an organization,

557
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,080
because these things must be coming up

558
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,920
that are reminding you

559
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,800
of previous things that happened.

560
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,080
And maybe one partner

561
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,080
dealt with one problem

562
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,120
and another partner is dealing

563
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,400
with a similar problem.

564
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,960
How does that knowledge retain

565
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,120
throughout an organization?

566
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,480
Well, we write everything down.

567
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,240
So, we like to document

568
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,160
what we've done in the past

569
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,560
because one of the very first questions

570
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,080
that we ask is,

571
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,280
"Who's done this before?"

572
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,040
So, this is one of the

573
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,840
business school 101 questions

574
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,440
that you learn on day one

575
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,400
when you're doing case study evaluation.

576
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,280
You look around the room,

577
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,240
you look at your team, and you go

578
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,160
"Who's done this before?

579
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,840
Who knows something about this?"

580
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
So, in order for us

581
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,520
to be able to ask that question,

582
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,480
we document

583
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,680
what our work efforts have been,

584
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,960
and then we'll reflect back

585
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,600
on prior engagements

586
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,360
and use those as a case study

587
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,560
to document our new clients efforts.

588
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,400
That's wonderful. Okay.

589
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,720
So, 20 minutes go by very, very quickly,

590
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,360
but I have to ask you

591
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,520
the most important question

592
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,400
which is three words that you would use

593
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,560
to describe yourself.

594
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,400
And you warned me.

595
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,280
I know you warned me.

596
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,680
But not enough ahead in advance.

597
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,640
So, this is not a huge commitment,

598
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,720
but I'd still love to know

599
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,080
how you think about yourself

600
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,280
or how you would like others

601
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,240
to think about you.

602
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,000
So, the first one comes to mind

603
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,040
fairly easily.

604
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,520
I'm a problem solver.

605
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,440
I like problems.

606
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,520
I mean it can be mine, someone else's,

607
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,200
doesn't matter.

608
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,760
My brain is constantly on.

609
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,200
So, I love a good problem.

610
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,280
And then the other words

611
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,040
to describe me are

612
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,920
I don't know how this is an exact word,

613
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,440
but I appreciate brevity.

614
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,600
So, make your point.

615
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,000
Get it across.

616
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,560
Use as few words as possible.

617
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,320
We've all got lots of things to do.

618
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,840
So, be mindful of your time.

619
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,760
And I don't know

620
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,080
if there's a third word to describe me.

621
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,520
I am what I am.

622
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,640
I guess I'm very honest.

623
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,640
I'm very transparent.

624
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,240
There's not a lot of things that I hide,

625
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,080
and I pride myself on that

626
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,040
because I really stink at lying,

627
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,600
and I learned that lesson

628
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,920
a really long time ago.

629
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,400
So I'm forced to be honest,

630
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,920
and I appreciate that in others as well.

631
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,680
Kiran, thank you very much for the honesty

632
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,720
and for sharing your journey.

633
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
This was wonderful,

634
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,480
and I can't wait

635
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,160
to share this to the world.

636
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,320
Thank you very much.

637
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,840
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

638
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,280
Thanks for having me.

639
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,120
Take care.
