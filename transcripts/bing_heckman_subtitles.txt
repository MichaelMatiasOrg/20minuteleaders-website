All right. Bing Hackman, thank you for being on 20 Minute leaders. How are you? Terrific. Interesting times. Interesting times, but you seem to be in one of the nicest places in the world. What is this background? So this actually is a background that you might be more likely recognize as Yad Vashem overlooking Israel. Is this right, right at the entrance of Yad Vashem when The backside. The backside. The entrance is closed, you go through it. This is the backside of the view. So this is right after you're in this dark room. And you can you see all the faces and all the names and you go out to the light and you see the beauty of Israel. Is that right? Countryside. Right. Wonderful. Well, Bing such a pleasure to have you. Coming from an industry that I really know nothing about. Now, you don't really you deal with the real estate. But you don't really deal with, you know, a small apartment investment, like I hope to be a part of or that you know, the average person deals with. But you really deal with massive, massive real estate considerations. And you mentioned a few of them right before. But I'll let you take it away and tell me a little bit about what it means to you and how you've sort of pave your way through this. And then we can move on to some other things that we want to talk about. Sure. So I did feasibility studies for projects for Stanford Research Institute. SRI. International private sector shopping centers, apartment buildings, officebuildings, industrial, the Monterey Bay. You told me. Right? A Monterey Bay Aquarium play I love it. convention centers, arenas, stadiums, performing arts centers, recreational facilities, Calgary, different places. Fort Dodge, Iowa. A wide span. You go into a community, you learn all about it, and you kind of understand it. When you get into a more complex area. L.A., San Francisco. There's so much that goes on. It's a little bit hard to see. Anyway, I went from there MAI Appraiser. Wait. Wait. What is the feasibility tester? What is that even mean? So I look at other development. I see what it costs to operate, what it costs to build, what revenues they generate. And the feasibility is having the revenues generated, cover the cost to build and create a profit. So it's like you're gonna build an apartment building. You know, here's what it cost to build. Here's the rent you're gonna get. And so it doesn't make sense, as if that make sense. So let's take for example, the case study of the Monterey Bay. So you actually look at, OK, what is this actual, Well, given the structure that we want to build and the prices, how much is this gonna cost us? And then you take a look at the ticket sales and the projections Simple story. I looked at aquaria all over the country and I saw what the staffing was. I saw what the new stage were. I saw what the traffic was. I look at the different types of exhibits that had greater appeal. Then I presented that to David Packard and his daughter Julie, who was a marine biologist with a hub in the Marine Science Center next door. And they looked and they said, that's all fine, but we're gonna go big. So here's an idea of what you're gonna get into. And then here's what they decide to do, which is a wonderful thing. So we gave them a foundation base of the general expectation. And, you know, obviously they're pretty capable and understanding, insightful. And so then they chose to do what they did, which was terrific. Wow. That's incredible. You know, early anchors of a tourism area made famous So, it's not just real estate. It's really it's hard core economics work to really understand all of the moving pieces and whether this is an economically viable opportunity. That's right. You look at what goes on elsewhere. You understand that. You see how it applies and what kind of, you know, in other types of properties, what kind of market share in this one, you know, which side, what kind of tourism is there and how will that fit in? So it's that kind of thing. So I have to ask, when you deal with projects that are, you know, tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. How granular do you get in terms of the, you know, the estimates? So, for example, in this case, how exactly you try to be in estimating the potential revenue? It's like an appraisal. And again, after SRI, I became an appraiser. After becoming an appraiser, I worked for a high net worth individual and bought office institutional quality, opportunistic investments in the Western states, So, office R&D, industrial properties. And in each case, just like an appraisal, you're looking at the revenues, the expenses and the returns. And in acquisitions, you're looking, you know, what are the risk issues? I would find properties with a lease expiration in three years. It was too small for institutions, too big for private. My guy, he was perfect. He has 40 of these, you know, a couple of them roll out. It's fine. Anybody else? If they only have one, you know, they can't handle it. So you find a strategy that works a unique niche. And each case is there's a real world operation that's similar. And so you're comparing it to those defined, you know, what the value would be, what the opportunity would be. And in terms of granularity, you know, appraisals, you know, they try to get to be 90% accurate in their values. Ninety five. And there's a lot of variation, a lot of subject to talk about. Go look at a stock analyst on any big company. You're going to see a range of opinions. That is stunningly broad. And it's all subjective and they have extensive information to draw from. But, you know, you have a variety of opinions. And so with anything that factors in there. But you hope to get repeat business, so you try to be reasonably on top of things. Wonderful. So, you worked for this individual and then you move on and then you mentioned MIA. Right? The member of Appraisal Institute, MAI Was after us arrive before acquisitions. Lots of abbreviations It gets complicated. Yeah. Now I'm working with Colliers as a real estate broker. I do investment sales and I do help tenants. I like helping tenants. They need the help of other The landlords have all the information. Tenants are struggling to survive. The rents are very high and we try to, you know, even level the playing field a little bit. Definitely. Okay. So, Bing an expert in economics. Talk to me a little bit about what's happening now, because you know, coming in at 24 and just starting out my sort of my economic life. And this is a pretty interesting time. Yeah. Give me a little bit of context about-- If we're talking of that. People have been saying how awful things are and they've been saying that for a period of years. This is the best time to be born in the history of the planet. And if you want to talk about demo or work, you want to talk about vision care. You want to talk about opportunities to raise a family and to get an education. Right now, we have an unbelievable, unique time. But we started out with a healthy market. What people don't understand is there's two and only two drivers of long term GDP growth and GDP is in everything. But it's a central metric. And those two drivers are: labor force growth and productivity. So when somebody tells you they're going to grow the economy at 4%, they essentially have no understanding of economics. Short term tax cut spending, whatever, you can blip it. Long term, you have to have those two elements. And if you do, you'll have. And again, one percent per year with productivity, one percent per year, labor force, two percent is a healthy GDP growth in the current world. We're going to go to 10 billion people. We're at seven five. We're going to shrink back down. According to demographers, I'm not a demographer. That's what I hear. But right now, we have a good economic base. We have a lot of pent up demand that's going to express itself once we get things wrapped up. I don't know what the damage will be. Nobody really knows. But we are incredibly fortunate. And the thing that really strikes me really strikes me today is the opportunity. we have to see that we're all in this together. You know, I feel like we're in a time of more intense tribalism than I've ever felt. Yeah. For sure. Why? You know, we should be advancing from an economic metrics point of view, as I view it. We're actually better off compared to most of history. We all have our thoughts on the topic. But, you know, I also note that A healthy community is different than tribalism. But for me right now, there is a profound lack of perspective. So I'd like to talk about that a bit. 100% All `right. Okay. So, let me just share something on my screen. Please. Because this is I think it tells a story. Can you read that? Yes, I can. This is by Albert Einstein. I think most people know who he was. As a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe. This is a part limited in time and space. And he experiences himself or she thoughts and feelings as separated from the rest. And it's really kind of an optical delusion of our consciousness, as Einstein puts this. This is the kind of delusions of really a prison for us. So, we see ourselves as separate and at odds with each other. And our task is to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion, embrace all living creatures. And the whole creations. Period. This is the central theme of pretty much every major tradition. Right. And this is the perspective that's lost. We see our little silos. We see our little tribes. We don't see our ethical imperatives. We don't see our connection. Right. And another great visionary, Abraham Joshua Heschel. When I take the time to look, there is wonder in the commonplace and wonder is commonplace. And I want to reflect on that just a little bit. For me, the big picture helps put things in perspective, by which I mean if you took all visible matter in the universe. Big topic. 70% is hydrogen. 27% helium. 97% is stars. The other 3% only is all the other elements appear on the periodic table. Here we are, on a carbon based speck of dust in aboard of rocks orbiting around a heat source on which there was an algae bloom. Oxygen in the atmosphere. And we live in an oasis on which life has spawned in a incredibly hostile universe. Right. We understand the magnitude of that gift for you and I to have this conversation. For us to raise a family or to pursue whatever we might. That is a perspective that I think is sorely lacking. We're disconnected from nature. We're disconnected from our connectedness. Right. And we're all part of the same. And we're unique expressions of that. But we're distorted expressions of that. You know, all great traditions helped to reduce our distortion. What do they wanted to do? The common theme is seeing and feeling everything and everyone as sacred. Can you imagine if we all felt and saw each other and this oasis in that light? And it's again expanding our circles of compassion. Another thing that's important is to have a sense of the magnitude of our ignorance, our silos and our echo chambers. This is a Gallup poll that I've looked at for 10 years, running in repeats each year. The same outcome. Gallup. I still don't believe this. But look it up. The percent of adults in America that believe in creationism, the earth is 10000 years old. Creationism. 40% in America. So, we have, 40%of Americans believe that the earth is 10000 years old. Yeah. And, you know, obviously, we've lost our faith in science. It's a lot of chaos. We're emotional beings and creatures. And so what do we do? You know, that's a big question. Well, we start with really looking at our actions and our interactions with others around us. A major theme, again, of all traditions. So, I will start with Amos. That book of the Bible is like 1750 B.C. So at 2000, 2800 years ago. They were saying righteousness and justice is what's paramount. And then you go, I don't know, let's say 350 BCs. When Plato wrote The Republic, which centered as a theme justice. And why is it that nice guys finish last? Why is this? Why is that? But it was also the great appreciation of reason. But we remain emotional beings. But justice is a central theme, and it's really an ethical imperative for all major traditions. Right. So what's happening? Let's understand this a little bit. I took a course on religious literacy and people understand violence as direct violence. But violence is more than that. It's structural violence and it's cultural violence. So what do I mean by that? If you are suppressing opportunities, you are creating structural violence. If you're vilifying, if you're demeaning, you're creating cultural violence. And you're most would be appalled at direct violence. If you had, you know, at least showing up with police dogs and fire hoses and running people down who are peacefully protesting. Right. It would be appalling. But people are not appalled. They're insensitive to cultural violence and structural violence, which are just as egregious. We need to better understand how we contribute individually, directly and indirectly. Think of a black lives matter. The sudden deduce of the Bible to justify slavery and sacred texts or for revealing and inspiring a sense of the sacred. To use sacred texts to justify exploitation, historical claims, oppression. It's an egregious violation of the second commandment. One of the foundations of humanity's aspirations. There's a very, I'm going to repeat that actually. Sacred text or for revealing, inspiring a sense of the sacred. To use sacred texts to justify exploration. Historical claims or oppression is a  horrific violation of the second commandment. And you know, if we learn nothing from history, such sacrilege by religious zealots has been the cause of many wars and much suffering. So what's the lens that we want to look at? I'm going to quote here, [--]. He was a Jesuit. The way we treat people is the way we treat God. Very clear. Think of trauma. You have a in oppressed situation. There's great trauma in that. And that trauma compounds. If you have opportunity. It's like having a dollar. It grows in invest. And it grows over time. If you don't, you have a cycle of poverty that cannot be broken. Vilifying others is cultural violence. Condoning and supporting it is, too. Even if only  indirectly Constraining opportunities of others, is structural violence. Separating others, limiting or preventing exposure and interaction causes cultural violence to fester. Conversely, facilitating exposure contact reduces cultural violence that builds bridges. We need bridges, not walls. A quote that I'm going to cite is really a beautiful one. It's from Kurt Tucholsky A country is not what it does. It's also what it tolerates. And, you know, we've probably heard Micah and this very famous, you know, I guess Micah 6:8 He has told you, O mortal, what is good. and what does the Lord require of you? But to do justice, love kindly, and walk humbly with your God. And to me, this perspective, connection with nature, connection with the being that we're all part of and seeing each other as a part of that is something we need to move toward. No, no, I completely agree. I would love to you ask a few questions. And do you mind stopping this scripture just so that I can see you again? And I think that really what I'm what I'm curious about and I think it's extraordinary how much thought and meaning you put into this. What I'd love to know is where does this all come from? So, you know, coming from economics, working on really an incredible, incredible deals. What brings you to be so passionate about this idea of our mutual responsibility to be kinder to each other and to be part of this creation? Where does it all stem from? Okay. So I graduated college 100 years ago. And I had to decide what the heck am I going to do? And so I started thinking, Okay, gosh, I don't know. It was back in the 60s. I thoroughly enjoyed the 60s, but that's another story. But it was a time of reflection and you know, did I want to go into service, I want to do this. I want to do that. I don't want to be a business person. And I realized that what I need to do to understand how to navigate my life is to see what's important. And to me, what's important is this what is the nature of creation and our role in it. And that theme has been with me. Through these decades as a central. Point to ponder, in all the opportunities that I've had. And I lived in Los Angeles and had numerous opportunities to look at different traditions. I've traveled the world, India, Israel, wherever to look at centers and meet with teachers that I thought were helpful in some way. We have such a cornucopia of resources. It's absolute externally. So it's basically, you know, my central journey. The other things I do certainly are practical. I like to refer to it as practical misses. I think that's where my surprise stems from because, you know, a very practical guy. I mean, there's economics is one of most practical things, I think, to study, unless you're a theorist. But I think that it's still extraordinary. And I you know, we have just just one minute left. But I'd love to ask you my last and favorite question, which is three words that you would best use to describe yourself. Well, as I think about it, I thoroughly enjoy looking into things, exploring. And so I guess probably what I'd say is I'm just a Fascinated Explorer. I find it fascinating. I'm fascinated by it. And I can't think of anything more interesting or exciting. So I'm a fascinated explorer. That's wonderful. Okay. So I'm gonna take that as two words. But I think that they're so grand and so, you know, they can mean every person can interpret them in a different way, that it just alludes to more. So I'll take that happily. I put a word A in front. So, that's three words. You win. It's wonderful Bing, thank you for the time. And I thank you for sharing your thoughts on our mutual responsibility. And I think it's wonderful to have both you know, a very practical livelihood on one hand. But then thinking about the larger picture things And I love that you chose that background of the view, right out of Yad Vashem. And with all the symbolics that it has with it And you know, some of the viewers of this don't know necessarily about Yad Vashem and what this represents, but really it represents life after, you know, the worst possible place you can come from. And that, you know, I've been to Yad Vashem quite a few times. And really it's an extraordinary feeling coming out from this darkness up and seeing this this beautiful countryside. And I think that our talk also resonates a lot with this idea of we're in a very difficult time, but we can always step back and look at the look at the beautiful world that we live in and what's our responsibility to maintain it. Bing, thank you for the inspiration And hopefully appreciate with wonder, fascination and curiosity. I love it. Incredible gift that we have. Thank you Bing. Thank you very much. Bye bye.
