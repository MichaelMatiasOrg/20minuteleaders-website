1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,119
As a human, for every click of a button

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,519
that you have in your test

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,159
which is thousands,

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,359
you can't remember.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,319
Wait a second, I use this property,

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,040
but I'm going to change it.

7
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:14,079
You can't remember everything.

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,500
For a computer, that's like.

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,079
Oren Rubin, thank you so much

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,439
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,119
It's been a while,

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,920
but I'm so glad

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,000
that I finally caught you.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,560
How are you?

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,400
Indeed, doing great my friend.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,360
How about you?

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,320
Doing fantastic.

18
00:00:58,321 --> 00:00:59,599
You are so kind and gracious

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,680
to invite me to a wonderful dinner

20
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:02,519
a few months ago.

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,480
I don't know if you remember,

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,720
but you brought a great focused group.

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,080
We talked about testing.

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,160
We talked about research and development.

25
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,720
We talked about the struggles

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,880
of building beautiful products.

27
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:14,519
And it was very inspiring for me.

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,840
So, thank you for the invitation for that.

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,720
You're welcome, my friend.

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,240
Any chance to see you is great.

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,200
I love it.

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,800
Oren, you have a beautiful journey

33
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,720
from IBM to WIX to Applitools

34
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:28,239
to now Testim.io.

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,600
With a lot of things in between

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,720
that I didn't even mention.

37
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,880
But it doesn't do justice

38
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:35,879
to the core of your journey.

39
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,200
Tell me a little bit about yourself

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,880
and how do you even get involved

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,680
with testing?

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
First of all, you notice that it goes

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,040
from bigger companies

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,520
to smaller, like IBM,

45
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,480
I was employee 330.

46
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:52,759
At Cadence that was employee number 5000.

47
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,439
WIX that was 151.

48
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,839
Applitools, I was employee number one.

49
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,359
And Testim, that's employee number zero.

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,839
Yeah.

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,719
Wow. Okay, so that's a beautiful funnel.

52
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,319
And slowly through that funnel,

53
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,679
you're getting closer and closer to,

54
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,359
to this idea of quality and architecture.

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,479
Right?

56
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,039
I think quality was always there

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,279
in around me, like, for example,

58
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,399
at IBM, things needs to be tested.

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,519
I love doing that and

60
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,839
actually making sure,

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,239
when you, as an engineer,

62
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,679
you want to deliver to people, you want

63
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,160
to make sure that it's high quality.

64
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,720
Of course, and also

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,880
helping with the tools.

66
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,960
As a young engineer,

67
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,960
it's like I love those, actually.

68
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,920
So, later with Cadence,

69
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,320
I was a compiler engineer.

70
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:43,799
There's a language.

71
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,519
There's two languages

72
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,680
that were developed in Israel.

73
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,680
So, I was glad to be

74
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,280
working on one of them.

75
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,640
But the nice part is it was a language

76
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,880
for hollow verification.

77
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,840
So, that means my users, as they say,

78
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,040
were people that are testers.

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,800
So, to understand what they're doing

80
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,640
you need to understand a little bit about

81
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,480
test automation or in this case,

82
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:08,839
hollow automation.

83
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,999
So, I always had this thing in the

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,319
background, and even then with WIX,

85
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,679
of course, I did some side project

86
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,239
and that's how WIX got to me and said,

87
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,799
hey, we're moving from this spring

88
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,479
from flash to HTML,

89
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,240
come and help us build this product.

90
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,640
And everything was tested manually.

91
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:26,840
And so [--]

92
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,920
is a person that came that saw

93
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,280
that everything was

94
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:32,079
tested automatically and even had

95
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,519
a special special language for that.

96
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,319
I was like, "What? No way."

97
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,039
Are we going to WIX to run it manually.

98
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,120
So, then you start pushing in a company

99
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:41,919
which a company already

100
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,280
has a few hundred people, it's like,

101
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:48,199
it's not that simple to make the change.

102
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,359
But luckily, the amazing founders

103
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,999
and I worked closely with Nadav Abrahami

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,959
and Yoav Abrahami.

105
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,790
Omer on the technical side,

106
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,119
[--]

107
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,319
that an engineer

108
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,519
that turned into the dark side

109
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,639
of product and business.

110
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,799
But back then,

111
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,000
at WIX, I saw the challenge already.

112
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,319
And how to change a company and how

113
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,239
to make it from only manual testing

114
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,079
to be full CICD.

115
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,839
What was the most difficult journey

116
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,239
of taking a company of a few

117
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,000
hundred developers, you know,

118
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,520
hundreds of thousands or potentially

119
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,240
millions of lines of code and not just

120
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,200
slowly transitioning

121
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:31,279
to automatic testing?

122
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,120
I know how difficult it is to do it

123
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,960
when you have zero lines of code.

124
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,560
But how difficult is it to do when

125
00:04:36,561 --> 00:04:39,120
you have a lot of lines of code?

126
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
So, I think in WIX

127
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,240
it was a little bit easier

128
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,000
because they were just building

129
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:45,879
a new product, so that made it easier.

130
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,959
But you need to convince

131
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,760
people, actually,

132
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,959
that their way of thinking

133
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,360
should be different.

134
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,960
And you need to find out

135
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,600
who are the people

136
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,680
that can move something

137
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,000
inside the organization.

138
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,880
It's always like that.

139
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,800
Whether that's

140
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,840
in the technical side or not.

141
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,880
But you need to understand

142
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,840
who are the champions,

143
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,880
who are the people that

144
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,520
you need to get them excited,

145
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:09,519
one by one, get them excited,

146
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,599
and eventually you'll have

147
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,920
the majority of people

148
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,720
that are rooting for that

149
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:17,719
and will start pushing toward that

150
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,799
and will make the change.

151
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,079
Okay.

152
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,879
So, Oren, I have a challenge for you.

153
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,560
Are you ready?

154
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:25,079
I want you to get me excited

155
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,040
about testing.

156
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,920
You already use testing.

157
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:35,799
Wait a second, are you talking about

158
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,399
test automation or Testim.io?

159
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,799
Let's start with this idea

160
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,480
of why testing is even important.

161
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,879
Well, you always test.

162
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,919
You don't even know about it,

163
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,879
but you always test.

164
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,239
The question is when.

165
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,920
The question is, who's testing it.

166
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,520
Are you testing it or your users?

167
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,880
So, bugs are your business

168
00:05:56,881 --> 00:05:58,559
and it depends on the company

169
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,320
that it hurts you in a different way.

170
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,000
And some bugs like Intel had

171
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,560
that cost it four billion dollars.

172
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,240
And the branding.

173
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,960
Right. I remember that.

174
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,280
Oh, yeah.

175
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,800
And not to mention

176
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,200
spaceships that exploded.

177
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,520
It's very critical to make sure

178
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,320
that you're testing,

179
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,040
you're making sure that your product

180
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,440
does exactly what you want.

181
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,520
So, some companies,

182
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,760
very few, like Netflix, can say,

183
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,920
wait a second,

184
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,400
if if something doesn't work,

185
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,960
you'll come back in 30 minutes.

186
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,200
But in a lot of cases,

187
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,000
think about WIX

188
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,680
that someone wants to pay now

189
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,160
or PayPal or anyone that wants

190
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,920
to pay something for a product

191
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,640
that doesn't work,

192
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,760
for the next 30 minutes

193
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
they'll go to the competition.

194
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,560
Right.

195
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,760
So, you lose money.

196
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,320
Okay. So, I'm convinced

197
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,440
that testing is important.

198
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,320
But you know, when I started

199
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,320
my first few days as a software engineer,

200
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,920
I was told that before

201
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,160
I deploy my product

202
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,320
I need to write a bunch of manual tests

203
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,600
on JIRA, follow them manually,

204
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,000
and that's enough.

205
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,200
Then I'll deploy.

206
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,240
What's wrong with that?

207
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,080
What's wrong with the ideology

208
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:08,919
that I'll just write some manual tests,

209
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,719
I'll repeat them every deployment

210
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,039
and there's nobody better

211
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,440
than my own two eyes, right?

212
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,320
So, I think there's a few things

213
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,720
that actually happened

214
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,680
in the last decade.

215
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,480
One is that, we find out that

216
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:25,359
the earlier you find a bug,

217
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,240
the cheaper it is to fix it.

218
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,920
So, if you find it just before production

219
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,520
or a month earlier,

220
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,120
then that's a great improvement in ROI.

221
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,040
So, that's one thing.

222
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,840
The second thing is

223
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,280
you actually manually,

224
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:40,919
you can't you can't,

225
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,040
you don't have enough people

226
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,480
in the world.

227
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,440
Let's just say, your people,

228
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:45,399
there's a hundred developers,

229
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,800
if you want to run your tests

230
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,240
before every pull request,

231
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,200
and there's a lot of those.

232
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,080
And you need thousands of manual,

233
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,240
people manual test

234
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,960
that will go and click on stuff.

235
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,960
And you can't do that.

236
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,160
First of all, if you want to

237
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,240
go with a product

238
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,640
that was called Shift-Left,

239
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:07,279
you need a lot of tests.

240
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,679
And that means paralyzation.

241
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,319
And then you get this environment,

242
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,879
you want to run different browsers,

243
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,840
different parameters.

244
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,519
There's not enough humans in the world

245
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,679
and that's why we go to machines.

246
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,879
So, and they do it much better than us.

247
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,959
Much better.

248
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,239
And you're going to miss some stuff.

249
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,279
And the machine is not

250
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,680
going to miss that.

251
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,080
Even without coffee.

252
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,040
I have to say that one of the first time

253
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,280
that I use the snapshot testing,

254
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,920
it was still back in the IDF.

255
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,040
And I remember that

256
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,720
I was developing this website

257
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,320
and I've done the manual tests

258
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,360
and everything seemed good.

259
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,560
And I had just started playing around

260
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,520
with taking the snapshots

261
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,360
through Jest, I believe,

262
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,240
and all of a sudden it showed me that

263
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
that a part of the website

264
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:50,839
that I didn't even notice

265
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,440
started shifting.

266
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,320
And I could only imagine

267
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,080
how this could roll

268
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,240
and this bug would continue

269
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,880
and cost me more and more.

270
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,360
Oren, but I have to ask,

271
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,240
before we get to test to Testim.io,

272
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,559
you go through these companies,

273
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,880
you do all sorts

274
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,800
of different technologies,

275
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,040
and at the end you decide

276
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,400
that you're passionate about

277
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,440
automatic testing

278
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,160
and helping organizations

279
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,920
around the world to better test and do it

280
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,880
in a more fun and scalable way.

281
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,240
Why do you focus on that?

282
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,760
Why is that the passion at the end?

283
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,520
I think that you actually started

284
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,919
with the second thing of what you said,

285
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,039
which is I wanted to help and say,

286
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,880
I love, and so are you

287
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,600
we love to help people.

288
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:36,999
But now we need to understand

289
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,439
how can I help

290
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,559
and what is the best thing

291
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,040
that I can do to help people.

292
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,279
And of course, to affect

293
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,439
as much as more as possible.

294
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,640
If you work for one company,

295
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,320
you help them if you work at a company.

296
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:51,319
But if you deliver

297
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,679
a product that can help

298
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,399
thousands of companies,

299
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,280
then you get, you feel

300
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,040
you can help the large

301
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,000
scale of the world.

302
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,960
So, it starts with that.

303
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,240
The fact that you want to help

304
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,320
and the fact that you need

305
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,960
to understand what can I do best.

306
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,320
And I think,

307
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,040
when I'm asked about different questions

308
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,760
or talked to, before starting Testim,

309
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,400
I talked to so many VP engineers

310
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,240
in Israel and the world.

311
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,200
And in Israel,

312
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,840
it was much easier because everyone

313
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,880
is like in a walking distance

314
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,360
or nowadays, Zoom distance.

315
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,640
But you find out words

316
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,000
that what are those challenges,

317
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,080
what are their pains,

318
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,920
that's the most important thing.

319
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,920
And it's weird that a lot of of engineers

320
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,360
go to the "dark side" of the business.

321
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,200
And they can start a startup.

322
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,320
The most important thing

323
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
they need to remember,

324
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,520
someone told me a few years ago,

325
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,760
you start a conversation

326
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,520
not by explaining

327
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,200
what your product does.

328
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,400
It's explaining what is the pain

329
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,560
of the other person.

330
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,640
And everyone keeps saying things that

331
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,560
salespeople are sleazy and like,

332
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,480
no, it doesn't supposed to be like that.

333
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,240
Have a product

334
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,840
that answers someone's pain.

335
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:06,759
They'll want to buy it.

336
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,159
But usually a salesperson,

337
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,839
sometimes they have struggled to buy it.

338
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,640
Salesperson is just navigate that

339
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,280
and make sure

340
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,440
that they're going to make it

341
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,920
in the most easiest way.

342
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,800
It all starts with,

343
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,640
hey, you're solving a real challenge.

344
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:29,200
So, you entered the startup phase

345
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,000
very convinced that you're solving

346
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,800
a deep problem.

347
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,480
You've experienced it yourself.

348
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,720
You're talking to a bunch

349
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,280
of VP engineers.

350
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:37,119
You're doing your research.

351
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,199
What is the solution

352
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,000
that you come up with

353
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,840
that could solve this problem

354
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,520
for a lot of people?

355
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,000
I saw that most people

356
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,800
didn't even get started

357
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,080
with test automation.

358
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,920
And I have noticed trends.

359
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,760
First of all, there's actually a trend.

360
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,120
There was one that

361
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
code is moving to the front end.

362
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,200
Like every 10 years,

363
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,840
code is moving

364
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,880
from the back into the front

365
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,680
and it was mainframes

366
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,479
then that's the back end.

367
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,680
Then it was, first of all, PC,

368
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,080
the code was in the front end

369
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,440
then the web came along

370
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,320
and the servers, the code again was,

371
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
a lot of the most of the code

372
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,360
was in the back end.

373
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,440
And now we notice,

374
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,880
react, angular [--],

375
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,240
like so many of the code business,

376
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,440
critical business logic

377
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,720
was moving to the front end

378
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,920
and nobody knew how to test it.

379
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,200
So, everyone I see

380
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,880
that there's a challenge.

381
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,520
Everyone says, "Wait a second,

382
00:12:26,521 --> 00:12:27,839
I used to have one line of code

383
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,600
in the front end,

384
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,080
which I tested manually.

385
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,000
Now I have a million of those.

386
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,560
How the hell do I test it?"

387
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,320
Right.

388
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,240
And of course, test end to end.

389
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:40,279
So, we saw the trend.

390
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,319
First of all, you see a trend

391
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,000
and you're saying,

392
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,120
hey, it's going to spike.

393
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,840
The testing in the front end

394
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,160
is going to trend.

395
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,120
And what are the existing tools?

396
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,200
And the existing tools,

397
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,160
if you think about that,

398
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,240
just understanding a megabyte

399
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,280
12, 15 years ago,

400
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,440
last time the front end was in the center,

401
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,400
it was so much information.

402
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,440
One gigabyte it was like,

403
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,600
oh, my God, it's so huge.

404
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,440
The methods, things like AI

405
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,480
didn't exist 20 years ago.

406
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,120
Think of the change that's been since.

407
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,960
And then you're thinking,

408
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,520
what has changed

409
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,360
and how can I use technology

410
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,200
to actually solve something

411
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,640
that's needed.

412
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,680
So, start with that.

413
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
So, you started with that.

414
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,600
And so, what is the product now

415
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,680
that you've been working on

416
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,480
for the past few years

417
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,520
that I've also had a pleasure

418
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,720
of playing around with quite a few times?

419
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,000
So, what we saw, what we said,

420
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
wait a second,

421
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,440
to help with end to end testing, we said,

422
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,320
one of the biggest challenges was that

423
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,760
the UI keeps changing all the time.

424
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,720
And all the current technologies use

425
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,200
one fourth that you have to say,

426
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,560
hey, find this button based on the test.

427
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,680
First, you have to name it.

428
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,080
You have to do it yourself.

429
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,240
And that's literally I could do it,

430
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,200
calling it like almost

431
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,880
like doing it manually.

432
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,160
And the second thing is that it changes.

433
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,720
The application keeps changing.

434
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,640
As a human, for every click of a button

435
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,000
that you have in your test,

436
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,680
which is thousands,

437
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,880
you can't remember.

438
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
Wait a second.

439
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,840
I use this property,

440
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,560
but I'm going to change it.

441
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,560
You can't remember everything.

442
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,280
For a computer, that's like

443
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
that's like a no brainer.

444
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,120
They can follow and forever click.

445
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,560
You can have thousands

446
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,000
of different attributes and features

447
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
and you can say,

448
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,960
oh, I can find it in more ways

449
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
than a human.

450
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,880
Things that a human

451
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,600
didn't even think about,

452
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,160
I can think of ways

453
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,640
to how to find that element.

454
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,000
So, in here specifically,

455
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,160
we took the pain that people had,

456
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:53,039
which is how do I test faster.

457
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,280
I want them released tomorrow,

458
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,200
why do I need to write a test for a week.

459
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,760
I need it in five minutes.

460
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,560
And the challenge of, that case,

461
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,200
it's called testability

462
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,680
or test flakiness,

463
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,200
and taking those challenges and saying,

464
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,160
hey, how can I have a solution

465
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,600
that solves those questions.

466
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,760
Right.

467
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,800
And that solution becomes Testim.io

468
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
based out of San Francisco.

469
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Yeah. That's the beginning.

470
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,840
After that,

471
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,120
you see why people come to you.

472
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,600
And the more customers you have,

473
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,360
you understand what exactly they want.

474
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,280
You see more challenges.

475
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,520
And then you started seeing,

476
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,600
hey, I can do more things.

477
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,840
I can help them.

478
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,640
Then they started saying,

479
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:36,319
"Hey, there's duplications everywhere.

480
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,200
How can I find out?"

481
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,160
Then you're saying,

482
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,520
"Oh, we can use the same technology

483
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,720
to find all the duplications.

484
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,440
I recommend you

485
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,960
how to use a reusable component."

486
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,440
Those things always come

487
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,680
with talking to customers,

488
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,360
understanding their challenges.

489
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,440
Because the AI always ask one feature.

490
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,160
You talk to them,

491
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,920
you understand what the challenges,

492
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,480
and then you say,

493
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
hey, here's another feature

494
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,680
which is much better.

495
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,200
So, Oren, talk to me a little bit about

496
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,320
this feedback cycle,

497
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,880
this agile methodology

498
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,560
that you're using

499
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,120
of developing a product,

500
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,880
watching your users, talking to them,

501
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,920
understanding the pain points.

502
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,880
Obviously, as somebody

503
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,920
who's been doing it

504
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,960
for years, as an engineer yourself,

505
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,080
you can sympathize very, very well

506
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,760
with these pain points.

507
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,200
How do you then translate that

508
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,840
into a product that doesn't yet exist?

509
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,040
Because you're developing products

510
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,400
that don't yet exist.

511
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,000
You're taking pain points that do exist

512
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,480
and you're creatively finding

513
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,640
solutions for them through Testim.io.

514
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,720
So, how does that process look

515
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,560
like?

516
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,040
I think in my case,

517
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,720
it helps that I've been in this domain

518
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,920
for a long time.

519
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,440
Right.

520
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:39,960
And first of all,

521
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,920
there was a company

522
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,880
that was willing to pay

523
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,400
even before we had the product.

524
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,120
Wow.

525
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,760
That was, I think,

526
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,200
about $60,000 contract.

527
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,080
And I, showed them sketches.

528
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,920
So, I think they trusted me because

529
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,440
they saw earlier

530
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,720
when I worked in Applitools,

531
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,840
they saw me building a product

532
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,480
from idea to a real product.

533
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,320
And I think they trust this.

534
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,360
You need to build that trust

535
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,240
with the community.

536
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,520
But I think it's working very closely

537
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,200
with the customers from day zero

538
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,640
and ongoing all the time

539
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:17,599
working with them.

540
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,560
You have one thing

541
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,760
and that's in the beginning of a call.

542
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,360
Let's just say someone

543
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,560
is paying you already.

544
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,440
You have one thing

545
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,200
that you have to ask them

546
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,280
at the beginning:

547
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,480
what are your goals

548
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,440
and how can I make you

549
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,960
the happiest person in the universe.

550
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,839
And then you start thinking,

551
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,360
okay, let's do this.

552
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,640
By the way, the trick here,

553
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,320
the trick here is that sometimes

554
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,480
a person's goals and the company goals,

555
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,760
they don't necessarily

556
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,440
all the time align.

557
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,440
I think it's very important

558
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,240
when you're building a product, it's also

559
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,880
you need to start understanding

560
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,400
how do people how do they think,

561
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,480
what makes them happy,

562
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,680
and where do they want to be.

563
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
And it's funny because

564
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,840
it's like I want to ask,

565
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,040
where do you want to be

566
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,200
in five years?

567
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,800
You have to know that

568
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,920
in a 30 minute conversation.

569
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,560
And to understand that with that person,

570
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,440
where do they want to go

571
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,840
and make them happy.

572
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,560
So, there's two things, when you said,

573
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:20,079
when we're talking about sell,

574
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,360
the only thing is trying to understand

575
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,560
what people want as the individual,

576
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,720
second thing is what makes the company

577
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,920
or the manager,

578
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,440
what would make the manager happy.

579
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,240
I love that.

580
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,080
Oren, where do you see this going

581
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,080
in five, 10 years?

582
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,840
The industry,

583
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,320
not necessarily just Testim.io,

584
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,560
but this idea of tests first

585
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,920
and test driven mentality,

586
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,920
where do you see us going

587
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,920
in 10, 15 years in terms of development?

588
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,160
First of all, I think developers

589
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,720
is always talking about the Shift-Left

590
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,960
that developers do testing earlier,

591
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,480
I think developers do

592
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,040
also the Shift-Right.

593
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,760
Developers will be much more connected

594
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,680
to what's going on in production

595
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,200
all the time.

596
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,400
When they see something,

597
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,360
when something else doesn't work,

598
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,600
I think that everything

599
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,680
that's going on in production,

600
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,400
you'll understand.

601
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,880
First of all,

602
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,200
what are your users doing.

603
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,560
Right now,

604
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,800
when someone's writing tests,

605
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,320
they don't even know

606
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,880
what's going on in production.

607
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,800
That's crazy.

608
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,000
They don't know what are

609
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,320
their users are usually doing.

610
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,520
Imagine that you that you do know

611
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,720
what all your users are doing,

612
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,160
what are the things that you didn't do,

613
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,400
if something a bug happened

614
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,240
that you know exactly

615
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,480
what the scenario is,

616
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,720
automatically.

617
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,880
So, I think those are,

618
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,760
but that's usually 10, 20 years.

619
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,520
From that degree,

620
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,000
that's going to be much sooner, I think.

621
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,880
After that, I think there will be,

622
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,120
you will connect more the product level.

623
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,120
I think you'll be able to test more

624
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,480
or define what the scenarios

625
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,880
when you're talking about the product.

626
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,200
This is what I want the product to be,

627
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
okay, here's my test,

628
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,040
automatically generated.

629
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,800
Those would have to come.

630
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,560
I love it.

631
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,440
Yeah, I think it has to come there.

632
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,760
It will be there.

633
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,080
I love that.

634
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,600
And I had the pleasure of both

635
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,920
developing with testing

636
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,400
and without testing.

637
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,800
And I can definitely testify

638
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,440
that it's a different world.

639
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,000
And in building application,

640
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,160
there are number of times

641
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,080
that I found myself

642
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,320
breaking my head against the wall

643
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,800
when I didn't do test driven development,

644
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,920
it was awful.

645
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,080
So, if all my friends

646
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,680
at Stanford and 8200,

647
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,400
if they're listening to this,

648
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,320
I'm a huge believer both in testing

649
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,880
and Testim.io.

650
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,360
And thank you for introducing me

651
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,000
to this world.

652
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,480
A lot of it is due to the work

653
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,520
that you're doing with Testim.io

654
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,840
that I got involved more and more

655
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,640
and learn about it.

656
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:41,519
So, thank you for that.

657
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,919
But Oren, before we finish,

658
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,559
I need to ask you

659
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,959
for the most important question,

660
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,080
which is three words that you would use

661
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,920
to describe yourself.

662
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,280
And I apologize in advance that I did not

663
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,840
tell you enough time in advance,

664
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,160
so I'm not going to hold you

665
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,200
accountable to that.

666
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,520
Do I have to describe myself

667
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,000
in three words?

668
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,800
However you'd like

669
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,560
to answer the question.

670
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,200
So, first of all,

671
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,800
I think like a lot of entrepreneurs,

672
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,960
I am a person that loves learning.

673
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,480
I love and I think

674
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,880
I'm doing what I

675
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,400
enjoying myself the most,

676
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,520
which is I'm learning every day.

677
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,680
Even years, even in the same company,

678
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,040
you keep learning it all the time.

679
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,040
So, I love that.

680
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,360
And but things that I think

681
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,760
the people don't know about me is that

682
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,640
on one hand I play the guitar,

683
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,920
I always played

684
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,640
at least electric guitar.

685
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,440
And on the other hand, I love rock.

686
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,040
And on the other hand,

687
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,440
I play Chess now, every day.

688
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,400
Actually, not just regular Chess,

689
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,880
it's Bughouse.

690
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,120
It's a chess variation.

691
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,240
Two people versus two people.

692
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,320
So, it's a little bit more,

693
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,800
you have to look at two boards.

694
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,000
And this the nice part,

695
00:22:09,001 --> 00:22:10,240
it's

696
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,799
of course,

697
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,959
you have to think about, you know,

698
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,119
10 moves ahead, and of course,

699
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,240
there's another board.

700
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,480
But there's also communication

701
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,840
with other people.

702
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,880
So, I think, and I see

703
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,120
you like that as well.

704
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,400
I can see that.

705
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,080
It's not just about technology and ideas

706
00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:26,519
and about cracking the,

707
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,879
the optimal just solution

708
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,200
on how to win your opponent,

709
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,800
you need to have a partner.

710
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,360
And you need to talk to them

711
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,640
and tell them what you need.

712
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,040
And you need them to help you out

713
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,480
and you help them.

714
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,760
Which is I think,

715
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,680
this is what I love most.

716
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,600
It's that working with people

717
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:47,799
and having that feeling

718
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,480
that we're all together.

719
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,399
The nice thing

720
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,439
I'm going to do right about this

721
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,239
is two things,

722
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,719
first, invite you to a game

723
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,359
on Chess.com;

724
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,799
the next one is looking at

725
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,599
this two versus two game.

726
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,880
Because it looks wonderful.

727
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,240
Oren, thank you very much.

728
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,320
Toda raba.

729
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,800
This was just wonderful.

730
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
Thank you.

731
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,120
You're welcome my friend.

732
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,440
Take care.
