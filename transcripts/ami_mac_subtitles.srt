1
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,132
All right. Ami Mac, thank you

2
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:58,799
for being on my show.

3
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,499
How are you?

4
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,666
I'm doing well.

5
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:01,899
How are you, Michael?

6
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,732
I am doing just fine.

7
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:05,199
So, you work [--]

8
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,832
from the Bay Area, right?

9
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,632
But you actually, have of something

10
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:11,499
very very relevant to what's happening today.

11
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,599
And you're the director

12
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,032
of Translational Medicine

13
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:16,599
at the Genome Center

14
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,166
within Stanford Medicine, right?

15
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:19,099
Did I get that right?

16
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,899
That's correct.

17
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,766
The Stanford Genome Technology Center.

18
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:23,599
Okay. So, what is that mean?

19
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,766
What does that mean, that you're leading

20
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,899
the translational medicine?

21
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,032
Sure. So, first of all,

22
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:31,732
thanks for having me on this show.

23
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:32,666
Of course.

24
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:33,632
You're doing a great job.

25
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:35,266
This is wonderful and very exciting.

26
00:12:35,267 --> 00:12:40,066
And so, at Stanford, your Alma Mater,

27
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:42,999
the Stanford Genome Technology Center

28
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,099
is a center where we use genetics,

29
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,332
microbiology, lots of different technology,

30
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,432
work with engineering.

31
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:51,632
And it's a multi-disciplinary group

32
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:54,866
that really is involve with lots of innovation,

33
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:58,366
and new product development used to study

34
00:12:58,367 --> 00:12:59,032
all sorts of

35
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:01,266
different healthcare-related problems

36
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:05,032
as well as biotech type of problems.

37
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:07,299
So, I talked with Dr. Ryan Davis,

38
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,432
and he was one of the leaders

39
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:14,032
in the looking at the human genome.

40
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:16,099
Wow. Okay, that's amazing.

41
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,632
Actually, your life story is very unique.

42
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:21,166
And I think, that's what I want us to start.

43
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,132
Because you're starting out

44
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:23,732
as a patient yourself.

45
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:26,132
So, you're a swimmer, exercise enthusiast

46
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:28,399
suffering a chronic disease

47
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,399
of lower back pain. Is that right?

48
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,866
Yeah. Well, lower back pain

49
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:34,599
was just part of my story.

50
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,232
To be quite honest,

51
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,932
this has been about a 20-year journey.

52
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:40,966
And so, the reason

53
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:43,199
translational medicine is so important to me

54
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,632
is because, it really is a field in which

55
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:50,732
you have to understand the patients

56
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:51,932
and what their needs are.

57
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:53,299
You have to understand

58
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,066
what researchers are looking for and doing

59
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:59,032
And then you have to be able to take

60
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:00,632
all of those things together.

61
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:02,666
Bridge physicians, researchers,

62
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:03,766
and patients' needs,

63
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:05,599
and come out with the most strategic way

64
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,799
to get to a goal.

65
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,099
And so, really understanding

66
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,632
what the needs of the various stakeholders

67
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:14,132
that are involve in.

68
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:18,299
For example, designing a diagnostic test,

69
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,632
or learning how to use yeast

70
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:24,666
for all new purposes.

71
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:28,932
Science can be done often times

72
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:33,832
in a way that is very, a nuance.

73
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:37,099
And so, being able to guide researchers

74
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,866
to say, this is actually what's relevant

75
00:14:38,867 --> 00:14:41,799
and this is what the patient's need,

76
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,899
is really where I fit in.

77
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,899
Okay. But you know,

78
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,766
you have the unique position of,

79
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:49,932
transitioning from patient

80
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:52,032
that you think, 20-year journey

81
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:53,966
you underwent a massive surgery.

82
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:56,166
And you know you can empathize

83
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,599
with the path that a lot of people

84
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,066
in similar situations,

85
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:00,699
not necessarily the same disease per se,

86
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,499
but different situations are facing,

87
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,799
and then, you are transitioning

88
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,599
to being a physician.

89
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,232
And now, you are acting as a researcher

90
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:09,499
and trying to innovate

91
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,266
past what we know today, right?

92
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:12,466
That's right.

93
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:14,832
So, about 20 years ago,

94
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,299
I had mononucleosis.

95
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,599
Which is a very common viral infection,

96
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,999
Epstein-Barr virus.

97
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,566
95% of the population actually has it.

98
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:26,332
But, somehow, for some reason

99
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,832
in my immune system,

100
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,366
that virus triggered something

101
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:30,999
and caused immunodeficiency.

102
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,832
And therefore,

103
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,466
I became more and more sick.

104
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,966
Ultimately, I was diagnosed

105
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:36,932
with the condition called

106
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:38,332
chronic fatigue syndrome,

107
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,732
which is now currently named

108
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:42,732
myalgic encephalomyelitis.

109
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,799
I understood the first one.

110
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,866
The second one, I didn't understand.

111
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:49,466
I admit it's a mouthful.

112
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:50,866
We call it ME for short.

113
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,866
And you may have heard a little bit about it

114
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:54,832
because now, with covid-19,

115
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:58,532
what we're finding is, with SARS patients,

116
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:00,032
covid-19 patients,

117
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:01,299
patients who have all sorts of

118
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,799
other communicable diseases,

119
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,532
many of them end up with this

120
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:08,532
unrelenting fatigue, as well as other problems.

121
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:10,832
Dizziness, brain fog, difficulty thinking.

122
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,566
And so, what we're doing

123
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,832
at the Stanford Genome Technology Center,

124
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,499
is we have heavily put

125
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,632
many of the resources

126
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:21,066
towards trying to come up

127
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:22,932
with the diagnostic test for this illness,

128
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:25,232
and solving the illness.

129
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:26,932
And looking at its molecular underpinning.

130
00:16:26,933 --> 00:16:28,166
Crazy. You know,

131
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,832
that's exactly why I love this show so much.

132
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,332
Because, we're preparing to do

133
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,299
this episode together,

134
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,466
And now that I got an email from this thing,

135
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:36,866
like, "Michael, just FYI, we're working on

136
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:38,466
on this crazy development

137
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:39,632
that's happening with covid.

138
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:40,999
And we're the front.

139
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,699
And then, I'm so excited to talk to you

140
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,066
about that, what is it like

141
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:45,232
being now on the forefront,

142
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:47,699
and discovering with the world,

143
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,266
but a little bit before the world,

144
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:52,766
how this unbelievable pandemic

145
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:53,966
is taking its shape?

146
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:56,332
Like really really to make sense of

147
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,799
all the confusion there.

148
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,466
Well, to be honest,

149
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:03,132
at times it can be frustrating.

150
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:04,899
Because we see things ahead of time.

151
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,166
And, as scientist, researchers,

152
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:12,732
and physicians, we need to prove

153
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:15,299
certain things using research,

154
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,766
however, based on prior viruses

155
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:20,866
we can have some idea

156
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:23,266
of what is in store

157
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:24,532
and have some predictions.

158
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:28,766
I was speaking with my colleague

159
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:30,266
and boss, Dr. Ryan Davis,

160
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:31,499
about two years ago,

161
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,966
and we had talked about how one day,

162
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:36,099
there will be a global pandemic of this nature.

163
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,699
And it's really quite astonishing

164
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,932
that this is actually happening now.

165
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:44,732
So, to be doing the work that we're doing,

166
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:48,232
it's very exciting.

167
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,666
And the way that I look at it is,

168
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,332
there's so many things

169
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,732
from a scientific perspective

170
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:55,299
that we need to still learn.

171
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:00,332
But to be able to be

172
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,899
right at the leading edge of discovery,

173
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,966
is so so exciting.

174
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:12,099
And what i really would love people to know

175
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,566
is that, I had an illness.

176
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:17,832
I went to medical school.

177
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,966
I went to residency.

178
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:21,232
I went to fellowship training.

179
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,466
Practice as a physician.

180
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:25,166
Ended up here.

181
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:28,032
Did some work with healthcare and technology,

182
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:31,432
and really dove deep a long time ago

183
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:33,166
into app development.

184
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,099
And how we can use mobile applications

185
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,699
to really understand

186
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,899
what's happening to humans.

187
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,566
And at this point now,

188
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:42,466
we have wearables that can plug-in to apps.

189
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:44,732
We have all sorts of really cool

190
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:48,032
innovative techniques to gather data,

191
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:51,232
so that we can tell patient's stories

192
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:52,932
and connect it to the research.

193
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:55,266
Because often times we do all this

194
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,232
really great molecular

195
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:59,032
and genetic tests and whatnot.

196
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:00,932
But what we're trying to do

197
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,799
is get real time data from people.

198
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,599
And make sure that that's clean,

199
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,232
and precise data.

200
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:07,932
And that's a huge challenge.

201
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:09,499
But somebody's got to do it, right?

202
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,999
100%. 100%.

203
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,932
So, talk to me a little bit about

204
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:17,866
this journey of yours, as a researcher.

205
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:20,766
Coming in as somebody,

206
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:23,432
a young entrepreneur, software engineering,

207
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:25,899
I don't get exposed too much to biotech

208
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,532
and the work with genomes,

209
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,599
and understanding the human body

210
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,399
the way that you do,

211
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,332
how do even get to start in this field?

212
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,466
And what's your day to day like?

213
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:36,499
Oh, that's a great question.

214
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,599
So, my day to day is very different.

215
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,832
I don't have a typical day.

216
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,066
And what I've asked

217
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:46,499
to accomplish in the center varies,

218
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,266
depending on which team I'm working with.

219
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:49,032
Right.

220
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:51,632
For example, right now,

221
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:52,999
I'm working on a project where

222
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,099
we are developing an app

223
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,399
So that we can continue to collect data

224
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,799
from patients who have covid-19,

225
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,532
to see what percentage of patients

226
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,399
end up developing

227
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,132
this chronic long-standing condition.

228
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:08,832
So, recently, Chris Cuomo on CNN,

229
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,966
stated that he also has this condition.

230
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:13,999
And Anthony Fauci has also talks

231
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,032
about how so many people

232
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:18,332
are ending up with long standing

233
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,966
long term debilitating issues

234
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:22,966
as a result of covid.

235
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:26,366
And so, for me, this has been my life's work.

236
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:27,599
And I'm so passionate about it

237
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,032
because I was one of those people

238
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:30,466
who is never supposed to make it.

239
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:32,599
I was one of those people

240
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,632
who was too sick to finish medical school.

241
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,632
Or too ill to do residency.

242
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:43,166
And for me, finally, doing my own research

243
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:44,532
and figuring out what was going on

244
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:46,432
and being able to maneuver healthcare,

245
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:48,632
because as a physician, I understood

246
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:50,399
how the healthcare system work.

247
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,232
For me, that's a great story, personally.

248
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,266
But, what I'm concerns about is

249
00:20:57,267 --> 00:20:58,499
what about the people who don't know

250
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,166
how to navigate the healthcare system?

251
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:01,899
How do we plug them in?

252
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,899
And then, how do we get people,

253
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,499
like you Michael, to come and help us

254
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,999
process through all these data,

255
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,466
use artificial intelligence to make sense of

256
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:12,299
the voluminous amount of data

257
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,166
that we're gathering.

258
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:15,866
And to really help find answers

259
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:19,299
and clusters, and uncover

260
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,066
a lot of problems that we find.

261
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:23,399
Especially the immune system.

262
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,632
The immune system is

263
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:25,966
extremely interesting.

264
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:29,666
And, we know things, but there's a lot

265
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:30,599
that we don't know.

266
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,032
And we need people to help us

267
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:32,932
from the data side.

268
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:34,032
We need people to help us

269
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:36,299
from the technology and wearable side.

270
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,666
We need fun, engaging apps.

271
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:41,599
We need to find that with the researchers.

272
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,566
I think that's incredible.

273
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,232
I'm actually very close to a startup

274
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:47,132
back in Tel Aviv called, Immunai.

275
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:48,532
They just recently came out

276
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:50,966
of stealth mode, and they're trying to use

277
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:52,699
artificial intelligence to uncover

278
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,399
the immune system.

279
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,599
And to help do research on that front.

280
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,232
But then, coming in as a researcher,

281
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:01,632
how do you, as a doctor now

282
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:02,799
think about this integration

283
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,566
with engineering and artificial intelligence?

284
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:06,166
Because I'm assuming that most doctors

285
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:08,266
in your position, don't necessarily have

286
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:10,966
the technological expertise of years

287
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:12,432
of dealing with data,

288
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:14,766
and all of a sudden, you understand that

289
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:15,899
in order to really make sense

290
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,099
of the research you're doing,

291
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,332
you're gonna need support from people

292
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,099
who have no idea about what you're doing

293
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,232
but they are experts in artificial intelligence

294
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:25,099
and you have to find this

295
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,066
in this weird combination, right?

296
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:28,699
Yeah. Yeah.

297
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,499
So, first of all, I have an amazing father

298
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,466
who is an engineer

299
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:34,766
and computer scientist himself.

300
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:36,332
So, being around a lot

301
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,832
of computer science people growing up,

302
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:45,266
I recognize the need for technology

303
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:46,999
to really help us solve problems.

304
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,099
So, he was in supply chain management.

305
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,399
So, I was able to apply

306
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,899
his supply chain management theory

307
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,366
to how to run the practice fluidly.

308
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:58,932
I think that I'm fortunate

309
00:22:58,933 --> 00:23:01,866
and that I work with such amazing,

310
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:03,132
brilliant researchers.

311
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:06,932
I'm learning every single day.

312
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:11,032
So, how I ended up here to be quite honest,

313
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:12,766
I let life guide me.

314
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,566
It was quite serendipitous.

315
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:19,499
I had done genetic research in undergrad

316
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,832
and I was thinking about doing an MD-PhD.

317
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,932
but they didn't have an MD-PhD program

318
00:23:23,933 --> 00:23:24,499
at the time.

319
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,866
So, I just did my MD.

320
00:23:25,867 --> 00:23:27,766
But unfortunately, I became ill.

321
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:30,032
And so, I got frustrated.

322
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:33,599
I've been both medical student

323
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,632
and a patient.

324
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:38,499
So, afterwards, I left medicine.

325
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,766
And I work in an internet startup company.

326
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:42,566
And then, I also,

327
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:44,466
so, we were doing UI/UX

328
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:46,832
before UI/UX ever even existed.

329
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:47,999
When are we talking about?

330
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,899
What year is this?

331
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,432
This was 2004.

332
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,166
Wow.

333
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,999
Right.

334
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,499
Wait. But that startup,

335
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,266
it was in the medical space, right?

336
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:03,332
No, actually, it was completely different.

337
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,466
Completely different.

338
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:05,899
It was a language learning company

339
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,066
called Mango Languages.

340
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:08,366
And it's still in existence.

341
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:10,832
And they're doing wonderfully.

342
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:13,499
But I always wondered, where all of this

343
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,266
different experiences I had,

344
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:18,532
when it will all come together.

345
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:22,232
and interestingly then, I was able UI/UX

346
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:24,032
and what I learned about that

347
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:26,666
to creating mobile healthcare apps.

348
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,566
I work with UPMC,

349
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,566
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center

350
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:31,632
and Harvard, and we have done

351
00:24:31,633 --> 00:24:33,199
a lot of work on creating an app

352
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,999
and I've done some advising in the past.

353
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,832
So, being able to integrate

354
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:40,899
just these various experiences,

355
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,032
if there's one thing I would say to people,

356
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:45,099
is don't be afraid to try something new.

357
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:50,032
Because the convergence of learnings

358
00:24:50,033 --> 00:24:52,599
from different fields,

359
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,966
is really where innovation comes from.

360
00:24:54,967 --> 00:24:58,166
It really teaches you to think differently.

361
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:00,366
And I encouraged people,

362
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:01,932
there's a lot of times, students will say to me,

363
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:02,699
"Oh my gosh, I wanna

364
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,566
take time off of school."

365
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:06,332
"But my parents don't want me to."

366
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:07,032
And I'll sit down

367
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:08,499
and talk to the parents and say,

368
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,466
"You know what? That experience,

369
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,632
one day, will really serve your son

370
00:25:13,633 --> 00:25:14,732
or daughter really well."

371
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:16,832
So, don't be afraid to try new things.

372
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:19,999
Because one day, just like in my life now,

373
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,166
everything manages to make sense,

374
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:24,166
and come together.

375
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:25,032
And all of a sudden now,

376
00:25:25,033 --> 00:25:26,732
you're dealing with the same disease

377
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,499
that you had to deal with for 20 years.

378
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,366
But now, you're dealing with it

379
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:30,866
from a research perspective.

380
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:32,999
And what are the implications

381
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,199
and how to help others through it.

382
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,332
But Ami, then talk to me a little bit about

383
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,532
this teaching style and mentorship.

384
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:40,599
You're alluding to that.

385
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,699
And right before our call,

386
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,999
you mentioned to me that

387
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,866
that is one of the things

388
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:44,899
that you're really passionate about.

389
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,632
So, what is teaching for you or mentorship

390
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:50,599
guiding others through their own journey?

391
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,132
Which you're mentioning is

392
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,766
very sometimes difficult to do

393
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:56,632
when you're getting a lot of pressure

394
00:25:56,633 --> 00:25:57,532
from different sources,

395
00:25:57,533 --> 00:26:00,632
and it's hard to navigate your own path.

396
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:05,399
So, to me, I was very fortunate.

397
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,499
I started my residency

398
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,599
and joined our academic association,

399
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,466
the Association of Academic Physiatrists.

400
00:26:11,467 --> 00:26:15,366
And there, I was very inspired.

401
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:18,032
Because we have lots of physician leaders

402
00:26:18,033 --> 00:26:19,332
that took all of us on.

403
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:20,266
And what I learned is,

404
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:21,966
you can never have enough mentors.

405
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:23,466
Because each mentor,

406
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:25,366
may have something different to offer.

407
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:28,466
One might be more interested in media affairs.

408
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:29,732
And another might be more interested

409
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:31,866
in technology. And there's so many

410
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:33,432
different things you can learn

411
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:34,599
from each one of them.

412
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,766
So, I always tell people,

413
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:37,066
don't be afraid to seek out

414
00:26:37,067 --> 00:26:38,432
as many mentors as you can.

415
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:42,899
And for me, one day, when I'm gone

416
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,899
it's important to bring other people

417
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,632
into others who will be doers.

418
00:26:48,633 --> 00:26:49,732
Other will be thinkers.

419
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,732
And you're excited about forging ahead.

420
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:54,432
We're living right now

421
00:26:54,433 --> 00:26:56,632
in a very tumultuous time.

422
00:26:56,633 --> 00:27:00,032
Tumultuousness doesn't mean that

423
00:27:00,033 --> 00:27:01,999
we have to fade away.

424
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,132
It means, this is an opportunity

425
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:07,599
to really seek deeply what's in your soul

426
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,732
and pull that resilience out, and say,

427
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:11,699
"What can we do to make this better?"

428
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,999
Because there's always been times

429
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,799
in history where there's been scary things

430
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,266
that have gone on, whether a war,

431
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,332
this, that, or the other thing.

432
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,799
But it's really the people

433
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,332
who pulled themselves up and said,

434
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:21,866
"How do we fix this?"

435
00:27:21,867 --> 00:27:27,099
That's really what pushes humanity forward.

436
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,432
I think one of the most common phrases

437
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:33,032
of Stanford Business School

438
00:27:33,033 --> 00:27:34,766
is, don't waste a good crisis, right?

439
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:35,899
Yes.

440
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,899
I remember who coined it,

441
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,532
I think is was Churchill or something.

442
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,632
But I think it's very true.

443
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:42,666
And it's not just in the realm of

444
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:44,799
how to leverage economically

445
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,799
a crisis that's happening.

446
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,066
And that's a lot of where entrepreneurs

447
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:48,566
go to, but also, how do,

448
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:50,466
in terms of mentorship and teaching,

449
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:51,399
how do you take this time

450
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,166
of introspection and understand

451
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:54,499
what do you want to do.

452
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,299
And I have a lot of people that I speak to

453
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,032
that have been taking this time out

454
00:27:58,033 --> 00:28:00,999
and re-evaluating what their priorities are.

455
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,099
Which you're forced to do when you're,

456
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,066
when all of a sudden you don't have

457
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:07,366
all of the experiences outside

458
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:10,332
that are noise, that don't allow you

459
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:11,832
to look internally, right?

460
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:13,232
Absolutely.

461
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,432
You bring up a really good point.

462
00:28:14,433 --> 00:28:16,299
Breaks for self-reflection

463
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,699
are really important.

464
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,132
Because otherwise, you end up

465
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:20,266
having completely different path

466
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:21,199
than where you want to be.

467
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,166
And, we go in different directions.

468
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:26,366
Sure. Ami, what are you excited about?

469
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:27,832
What are really gets you up

470
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:28,899
in the morning and make's you

471
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,899
so passionately and glowing

472
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,866
throughout the day?

473
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:33,599
First of all, learning.

474
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,966
I also, still continue to have mentors.

475
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,566
So, every day, learning about

476
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:41,532
what we can do with healthcare technology,

477
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:42,366
all the research.

478
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:44,066
I mean, reading constantly.

479
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:45,632
Throwing myself into the work.

480
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:47,632
But what really excites me is,

481
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:49,499
this disease that I've suffered from

482
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,232
for 20 years, that has received

483
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:58,299
very little attention, very little funding.

484
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,966
Unfortunately, there's a pandemic.

485
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:05,566
But fortunately, we have the opportunity,

486
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:09,066
like you said, now, to study this,

487
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:11,132
and understand what's happening.

488
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:14,799
And it's too bad that it took

489
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,199
a global pandemic for us to be able to

490
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,032
seek out the answers

491
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:21,799
to what is happening inside of the body,

492
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,899
as people transition from getting a virus

493
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,366
and what happens long term.

494
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:28,132
But we have to grab it with both hands.

495
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:31,132
And so, for me, trying to let people

496
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:32,066
know what's happening

497
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:34,532
and get funding for this kind of work,

498
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:38,899
and speaking with the different researchers

499
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,399
and talking to the FDA

500
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,066
about how are gonna get things improved.

501
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:45,232
But what really grabs me is,

502
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:48,599
how we can leverage technology now

503
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,299
to answer questions

504
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,832
that we could never answer before.

505
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,832
There's so much data out there.

506
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:58,032
And so, we need technology

507
00:29:58,033 --> 00:30:00,099
to be able to really parse through

508
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,132
all that information that's coming at us.

509
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:04,299
Yeah. I mean,

510
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,332
that's exactly where I think,

511
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:06,499
the world is headed right now, right?

512
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,132
We're seeing this bloom of understanding

513
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:10,866
that now we have to leverage data science

514
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:12,866
with the work of researchers and doctors

515
00:30:12,867 --> 00:30:14,066
like yourself, to really make sense

516
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:15,166
of what's happening.

517
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:17,899
And I'm personally very very excited

518
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,766
to see where we're headed.

519
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:20,099
And what's gonna happen

520
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,232
the next few years.

521
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:22,066
I'm especially excited

522
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:24,132
to be a part of this transition

523
00:30:24,133 --> 00:30:26,166
and get my own hands dirty

524
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:26,999
with a lot of this work.

525
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,499
Ami, before we leave, I have to ask you

526
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,632
the most important question.

527
00:30:29,633 --> 00:30:30,799
Three words that you would use

528
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,799
to describe yourself.

529
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:37,632
Let's see.

530
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:41,132
Inquisitive.

531
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:42,599
Okay.

532
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,299
Fierce.

533
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,032
Fierce. What does that mean?

534
00:30:49,033 --> 00:30:51,332
Fierce means,

535
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:58,066
seeing that something's challenging

536
00:30:58,067 --> 00:30:59,299
and going for it anyway.

537
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,632
Okay.

538
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:05,432
So, I guess the next one would be,

539
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:06,799
Confident.

540
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,132
Confident that you will figure it out.

541
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:11,699
And resilient.

542
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,099
Inquisitive. Fierce. And confident.

543
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,232
I love that. I think, that's exactly

544
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:16,299
what it takes to do the work

545
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:16,999
that you're doing.

546
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,866
So, no surprises there.

547
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:22,366
Oh, thank you Michael.

548
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:24,799
No, no. This was great.

549
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,899
Thank you also for your generosity.

550
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,566
Thank you for your time.

551
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:27,699
This was just inspiring.

552
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,299
I'm personally, I think that,

553
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,566
I can't wait to get [--] to this world

554
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:32,532
and understand it better.

555
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:33,799
Because this is where the impact is

556
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,966
at the end. At the end,

557
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:36,666
it's literally savings lives

558
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:39,266
and helping people going through pain

559
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:41,099
live their lives better, healthier,

560
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,999
and in less pain.

561
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,266
And coming in from the data science,

562
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:46,099
I myself, I'm just excited to see this.

563
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,299
this harmony. I'm very excited.

564
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,232
One last thing I do want to

565
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:54,166
let everybody know, is that,

566
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:57,966
we estimate that 2.5 million Americans

567
00:31:57,967 --> 00:31:59,966
have chronic fatigue syndrome

568
00:31:59,967 --> 00:32:01,832
or myalgic encephalomyelitis.

569
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:05,332
And there's been less than $5 per patient

570
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,499
of NIH moneys that have been put

571
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,966
towards this.

572
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:11,832
Just to give you a little bit of background,

573
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:14,332
there's 950,000 of patients with HIV.

574
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:18,032
This is 75% of patients with this illness

575
00:32:18,033 --> 00:32:20,099
are either home-bound or bed-bound.

576
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,732
So, it's [-] disability.

577
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,166
So, if you think about it,

578
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:27,432
about at least 10% of patients with SARS

579
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:29,099
developed this.

580
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,166
Now, if 10% of patients

581
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:35,366
with SARS to or covid-19 develop this,

582
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:36,699
we have a big problem on our hands.

583
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,366
So, we really have no choice,

584
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:43,532
but to really figure out what's going on.

585
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:45,466
Because perhaps, we can prevent things

586
00:32:45,467 --> 00:32:46,732
from happening to other people,

587
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:48,532
that can destroy lives.

588
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,466
Unbelievable.

589
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,799
Ami, thank you very much for the inspiration.

590
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,632
Thank you, Michael.

591
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:54,732
Stay safe and stay healthy.

592
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:57,599
I look forward to talking again.

593
00:32:57,600 --> 00:36:31,133
Take care. Bye bye.
