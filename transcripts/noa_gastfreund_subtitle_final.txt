1 All right. Noa Gastfreund, how are you doing? I'm good. How are you? I am fantastic. I'm so excited to share these next 20 minutes with you to talk about the wonderful hybrid program that you're working on as well as some of the other endeavors that you've had. Noa, to get started, I have to talk about this fun fact. You grew up wanting to be a supermodel. Talk to me a little bit about that. Okay. So, yeah. When I was 14, I guess, it was my dream. I didn't realize that it won't happen never because I'm not that tall. Yeah. And no one told me. No one told me that. But I went to an agency in Israel called Roberto, which is the well known agency here in Israel. And he accepted me also. I don't know. I thought that, I think it's a joke. I don't know. But he accepted me. But Noa, it's so discerning because you don't have to be tall to be a supermodel. You don't have to be with specific weight and height. That's what everybody's talking about. The whole Me Too movement. You don't have to look a certain way to be a supermodel. So, why is it so far fetched? Nowadays you are right, but 14, 15 years ago, I'm not sure. And now you know my age. Yeah, but I'm passed Now I know I can't be a model. Everything is right. All settled down. So, we are good. And now you're focused on doing good for the world. So Noa, let's start with a little bit about Hybrid, this incredible organization in Israel. The name aims to give a little bit of a taste into what you're trying to do. But what is Hybrid? So Hybrid, I'll start from the beginning. It's a co-initiative between the 8200 Alumni Association, which I'm part of, and the government in Israel. Actually, Eitan and Fadi initiated five years ago and thought that why not 8200 with all the connection and skills that graduated 8200 unit can help other people which in our situation is Arabs and Israelis. So why not. So I think today, it's something that is more common and people understand what we are doing and love what we are doing. And I think that five years ago people, not all of them understood the reason and the match between the 8200 and the Arab community in Israel. And I think it's a great success, because we are truly helping the Arab society succeed and merge into the high tech ecosystem and specifically into the startup ecosystem. Yeah. So Noa, before we get deep into the workings of the program and how tangibly that happens, give me a little bit of context into the ecosystem and the relationship between the 8200 unit in the Israel Defense Forces through the Arab communities in Israel, the integration with the tech ecosystem. Eric Schmidt, the former chairman of Google and now of Alphabet, he talks a lot about how the startup nation, part of the foundation is built upon these technological units. And the army in general where you take 18 year olds and you give them the skills necessary to both mature very quickly, but also professionally to execute on very mission driven missions. So, give me a little bit of context into what's happening in Israel and why is Hybrid even relevant, especially in a place like Israel? Because in other places around the world, it might not seem very forthcoming and relevant. Yeah. So, here in Israel, the 8200 and other units, army units, are helping their graduates to succeed. It's a well known unit that you know, you just need it recorded in your CV and you're good to go. And unfortunately, the Arabic community are not taking part in this play And I think this is where Hybrid is coming to action and actually take all the value and the skill and the networking of the 8200 that helps them to succeed to the Arab community and like sharing the success. This is what I would say about Hybrid: sharing the success within those that are not, I won't say lucky enough, but they don't take part in this play and yeah, and it's affected them for sure. Right. So, up until now, there is a very clear distinction between not just the Israeli, the Jewish Israelis and the Arab communities, but also within the Jewish-Israeli community. You have those that go to the elite technological units. Like you're mentioning, they put it on the CV and they're pretty much good to go. It's like the MIT or the Harvard of the United States. And then, you have a program like Hybrid which aims to connect other communities with that community. So, what is the actual program? How does it actually take place? Yeah. So, our goal is actually to build a diverse team. I can't say, like Jewish and Arab. I can't say it's something that we are very succeeded by now, but what we actually do is under the 8200 Alumni Association, there are some accelerators. And we are acting the same as the other accelerators, but we are aiming to find the most talented Arabs in Israel and actually act as a gift or help them to get integrated into the startup scene. And I don't think we do something special except understanding and knowing who are our audience, understand their needs, and what we need to do in order to help them get integrated into the startup ecosystem here in Israel. So what does it take to get integrated into the ecosystem for somebody who's growing up someplace that is not necessarily in the heart of Tel Aviv, in the heart of startup nation, yet they have all the potential and all the capabilities of being a part of the startup nation. What does it take that you're doing within Hybrid? Yeah. So, I think the first thing that we are trying to help with is changing their mindset, okay. Those people are mostly coming from more conservative norms and way of life, and if they don't ... to be like doctors or something very conservative, they join the high tech but they mostly will join to corporates where everything is stable and without taking risks. So, I think first is changing their mindset, okay. Help them think how taking risks can change their life and can take them a step ahead and help them take part in the play that the other startups play, the Jewish led startup play. And second, I think, networking. It's a kind of challenge because they are not taking part of the army, not in the elite units and other, I don't know, other places that I was lucky enough to take or maybe you. So this is the second thing that we are trying to help with. And pretty much, the rest is Launching your own startup is it's hard for everyone, Jewish, Arabs, Christian, but I think we are trying to help them get to the starting line and from there, it's like help them as each and every entrepreneur on Earth, okay, because it's still challenging being an entrepreneur. Of course. So paint me the picture. How does the life cycle of the program work from the moment that somebody may go on the Hybrid website. What is the relationship between a participant of the Hybrid program, whether it's mentorship or accelerator or whatever, until the moment where they are, perhaps, launching their own startup and continuing to gain the support? Yeah. So basically, we are meeting startups within the whole year, okay. We are not waiting for a specific cohort or a specific event or something like this. We are here to help. This is the first thing that it's important to say. So, yeah. When they reach us out on every platform, via email, I don't know, meet us in events or through the website, we are very welcoming and trying to help all of them. Not all of them will join the actual accelerator of the course, but we are helping all of them because we know we have a mission. It's our mission to help those people with or without joining the accelerator. But the accelerator, the six month program is our main thing, okay. We work as cohorts. Each year we have six month program. The main pillars will be the mentoring program, and the ..., you know workshops, sessions, one on ones, office hours with investors. And pretty much everything, all you need in order to build your own startup and being entrepreneur in Israel. We are here for them. We are very listening to everything, trying to do as much as we can in order to to help them grow, to help them succeed. And our goal is, within these six months, to help them being able to reach out to investors and raise their first round, their seed round probably. So, this is our main goal within the accelerator, but we are doing much more than that. Of course. It's going to be impossible over a 20 minute session to explain, to really grasp what's happening there, but I'll try. So, talk to me a little bit about the highlights that you've had within the program, whether they're personal stories that you've come across or people that whose lives have been transformed by the mentorship they've gained through Hybrid. Or perhaps startups that have actually gone through the program and have shown that, over these six months, they're able to form a startup and actually raise capital. Yeah. So, I can start with saying that we are looking for the cutting edge technology startup, the talented people that we can find, and yadda, yadda, yadda. But I think we are mainly focused on find the right people that qualified being entrepreneur in the nearly future. Okay. So, within the Hybrid, there are lots of pivots, changing routes, a lot of things happening within these six months. And I have a lot of story to tell, but if I need to pick one, I would pick Mira Awwad's one, which is a woman lead startup called Mirrori, and the co-founder and the CEO is Mira. She's a 2018 graduate. It was the third cycle of Hybrid. She joined as a ... entrepreneur. She came from the business, she has a business background with no technology founder. And she came with an idea, throughout the six months, she changed the idea. I won't say fired but yeah, there were lots of changes within the team. And by the end of the program, she launched her startup, raised their first round. Now she is preparing ... their next round. And she is, I don't know, I really appreciate their journey as entrepreneurs. What is their startup doing? It's a AI based beauty assistant that helps you put your makeup and pick your style based on your face shape. It's a ... technology startup and very interesting what they're doing there, really. Yeah. Very, very cool. So Mira Awwad comes in. She comes in with some business acumen but no technology founding team. She goes through the six month program. By the way, how intensive is this program? How often do they meet? Where do they meet? Yeah, usually once a week, but it depends on the program stage. But I would say once a week. Yeah. And how big is the cohort for each cycle? We accept 8 to 10 startups each cohort. And is this in a nonprofit structure or is there equity involved? How does it work? I forgot to mention, yeah. So we are an NGO. We take no equity. We are a non-profit organization backed by the government and other great sponsor that taking part in our program. Yeah. Wonderful. Wonderful. And so how many alumni are there so far? You've mentioned that 2018 was the third cycle of the Hybrid, so I'm imagining by now there have been four or five cycles? Yeah. Now, we are in the midst of the fifth cohort. We have about 40 alumni. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Very, very cool. And so how many of those alumni have actually gone on to raise seed funds or have made progress towards a sustainable startup? I would say 60%. Wow. That's incredible. Yeah. Yeah. We are on the statistics. Yeah. Well, it sounds like you have great statistics. Noa, I'd love to touch a little bit in the little amount of time that we have left, a little bit about your experience and your journey. You've done several things before this. And I'd love for you to help me understand a little bit of why you transitioned from working in the startup, Tipalti, and going into the 8200 Alumni Association. Running an accelerator, it's a very different job from managing human resources back at Tipalti. But what was that experience like, and what insights did you bring from those experiences towards your current job with Hybrid? So, it's a perfect question. Yeah. So first, Tipalti was an extremely perfect time for me. It was a startup school. I was with Tipalti about four years in HR position. I worked very closely to Chen Amit, which is the co-founder of Tipalti and the CEO of course which now I really understand how, he's a leader. This is what I can say, a perfect leader. And Tipalti- Why do you say that? Give me one thing that when you think about his leadership. Yeah. So strong personality. So, I don't know. Something, even though he was in the California office and we are in the Israeli office, he was all the time with us, okay. We all the time thought what Chen will say, what Chen will think of it. So, yeah. Strong personality. So at Tipalti, I was an HR manager but, I don't know. But I guess you know that while you're working on startups, you're doing much more than your title means. And I was pretty much the connector of the Israeli office, the R&D center. I did lots of project, and I was lucky enough to join Tipalti as a 15 employee here in Israel working with the core employees of the company. It's an amazing company to work in. Honestly. And it was an amazing period there. I love it. Noa, I can't believe that 20 minutes have gone by way too fast. But before we leave, I have to put you on the spot once and ask you for three words that you would use to describe yourself or that anybody at Hybrid would describe you as or Chen would describe you as. Who is Noa? Yeah. I think authenticity. This is would be the first word. Purposeful, or in Hebrew ... Yeah. And passionate about things that I'm doing. I love it. I love it. So now you're in the midst of the fifth cohort, and how much time do you have left in this cohort? So two months and a half. Two and a half months, wonderful. And when is the sixth cohort going to be applying? We will start next June. Our application open starting from early early early January. Wonderful. Okay. So, that's not too far from now. So, if anybody is listening to this and we actually had a wonderful live chat with a lot of the participants from Tech2Peace. Also a wonderful organization that has a wonderful mission. So, I just love these programs that are bringing communities together and helping bring up some communities through the experience that other communities have had, especially in the Israeli ecosystem. I think it's just inspiring and wonderful. But Noa, I ... want to thank you for your generosity and for your time. And continue doing amazing work. Thank you very much. Thanks to you, Michael. Thank you. Of course. Take care. Bye.
