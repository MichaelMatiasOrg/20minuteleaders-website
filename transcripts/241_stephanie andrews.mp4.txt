1 It was a way for people to authentically connect to one another and have a community and get to know people based on their values without necessarily being salesy. Stephanie Andrews, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? I'm great. How are you? I'm doing fine. Thank you so much for joining me. Thank you for being generous with your time. I can't wait to talk to you about your journey, about co-founding a startup with your two best friends. And more importantly, about the world of podcasting. So, I've had the privilege of being a podcaster for, I guess, about almost 8 months now. And I've seen the ups and downs of it. But I'm excited to learn about the industry from you. So, Stephanie, before we get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself and what you're doing at Quill today? Yeah, absolutely. Hi, I'm Steph to everyone listening. And I am currently Quill's Head of Production. Prior to that, I was the co-founder and CEO of a startup called Origins Media Haus, which was a boutique podcast and video agency in Toronto. And it definitely wasn't a linear path to get there. We pivoted multiple times. We actually started the company as a online magazine back when I was in my first year of university. And over three to four years we pivoted, tried to understand the content creation world, and eventually landed on podcasting as a way for brands to connect really interestingly with their consumers. Because it was a way for people to authentically connect to one another and have a community and get to know people based on their values without necessarily being salesy. So, that's really what we stood for as a company, as we wanted to make sure that brands were connecting with their consumers in a way that was authentic and it was real. And it wasn't just like a sales pitch or buy this or buy this. We wanted people to make informed decisions. And so, that was really kind of our bread and butter and where we started and how we landed on the podcasting realm. And yeah, so then we ended up getting a part. So, before we move on to that other part, I have to understand a little bit better the pain point that you're trying to solve. So, you're mentioning that you're looking at podcasting as a tool for brands to engage with their users in a more authentic way, less salesy way. Can you paint me a picture of what that looks like today or what it looked like a few years ago when you were just getting started? Because I do know that podcasting is that at peak. Right? We're seeing more and more podcasts. But what is it about podcasting that is so engaging and non-salesy? Yeah. So, what's really interesting about podcasting in my opinion is it's kind of a two fold. So, one is your connection with the host of the show. And then the second is really the convenience of the medium itself as being the audio. So, one, being able to connect to a host. When you're able to listen to someone for 40 minutes, a really good host should sound like you're talking to a good friend. It should sound like you're just on the phone. You don't have to say anything and you're comfortable. And what that does is it builds a really interesting parasocial relationship where you're the host is able to essentially talk to you and talk to your values and you're able to relate to them and feel like you know them, but you've never actually met them. And what that does is, as a friend, let's say, if this host is maybe the CEO of a company then and you connect with their values, then you're going to be more likely to like that company and you're going to be more likely to probably buy from that brand. Let's say it's a consumer brand. Right? And so, for example, there's been some really interesting shows that have used this. So, Breadwinners is an example from Harvest Bread where what they did was they created a show all about women empowerment and women breadwinners. And what that did is it showed that this bread brand had like values and it had, it wanted to empower women. And so women listening are like, okay, well, if I'm going to buy bread brands and I believe in these values, I'm going to buy Harvest right? So, that's kind of the interesting part of it, podcasting from a connection standpoint. And then in the medium, what's interesting is if you look at video, if you look at blogs, the correlation to those two mediums is you have to be staring at a screen. And especially today, I think when we look at covid and the pandemic, what are we doing all day every day is just staring at screen. It's like you stare at the middle screen and then you go off work and then you stare at the big screen and then you stare at your small screen when you're talking to someone and you just can't get away from it. So, podcasting offers a really nice, convenient medium where you can literally listen to it anywhere. You can listen to it in your car while you're driving, you can listen to it while taking a shower, while you're cooking, whatever you want. And video and blogs just can't offer that. And especially today when we look at how fast everything is rapidly evolving, humans are trying to constantly keep up and humans are trying to constantly consume information. And so, podcasting offers a convenient way to be consistently consuming without necessarily having to put energy into consuming. So, that makes all sense. So, I'm completely sold on this idea that podcasting is important, it's something relevant, it's extremely relevant for brands. I feel a little bit silly that we're doing this over a video then. But good thing that we're also taking the audio for Spotify and Apple podcasts, at least that. I'll give you a pass. Thank you. Give me a little bit of a higher understanding as to the market of podcasting. How many are there like, how many people podcast generally or listeners? I really don't know. Yeah. So, podcasting is actually a really interesting medium from an audience standpoint because it's all made up of mostly affluent millennials. And obviously that's expanded a bit since podcasting has kind of increased over the years. But the base of it is really that niche audience. And people are highly educated as well. And so, if you're looking for brands, it's kind of this beautiful medium because it's people who generally have a higher income, who are wanting to connect with values, who have that kind of higher, they're looking for basically brands to connect to. They're looking for that information and they're looking for brands that are conscious, I would say. So that's interesting from an audience standpoint. In terms of how big the market is, there's over a million podcasts. But what people don't realize, is that there's a ton of podcasts out there that aren't active. A million podcast? Yeah. We surpass a million this year as well. But what people don't realize is that sounds like a lot. But it's really not, because if you look at how many videos there are, if you look at how many blogs there are, there's so many more. And then on top of that, if you look at the podcasting industry out of that million, there's so many that are inactive. So, when you're actually starting a podcast, if you're going to actually do it properly, you're going to be consistent. You're going to be putting out episodes. You're going to look at it like a marathon, not a sprint. You're going to consistently put out episodes. Your ability to build an audience is going to be a lot greater than it would in my opinion, than any other medium out there right now. Wow. Okay, so where we seeing this going? So, do we see a continuous linear growth, exponential growth? Are more brands understanding this? What's happening to the market? Yeah. So in terms of the market right now, we're seeing a lot of brands invest pretty heavily into podcasting ads. And I think people are starting to kind of open their eyes. Specifically in the US, you'll see a lot of brands that are having, a lot of brands that have their own podcasts already. Canada, I think is a little bit behind. But that's usual. Not surprising there. And you're from Canada, right? But it's. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm from Toronto. So, I'm very used to the conservative nature of Canadians. But yeah. So, I would say that the media industry honestly is just much it's just more advanced down south. So, yeah, we're starting to see a lot of brands kind of pour more dollars into it. And I personally think that in the next couple of years we're going to start seeing the same trend as videos, like eventually I think there's going to be people whose job titles are podcast marketers. And I think it's going to be a mainstream media that you just have to have as a brand and as part of your playbook. That makes a lot of sense. So, tell me a little bit about your entrepreneurial journey with creating a company with two of your best friends. Yeah, sure. So, when we started the company, I was literally 17 years old. And I remember, I walked into my first year of university business class. And the first thing that the prof said was that 95% of startups fail. And so, me being a small 17 year old human who wanted to start her company so bad, I was like, great, that's fabulous. And so, I basically being someone who in high school, I was like a straight-A student. I was very perfectionists and I never failed at anything. And so I was like, okay, so, how do I not fail at this? I'm going to go and interview the 5% of entrepreneurs that are successful and figure out how they did it. And so, long story short, we ended up creating an online magazine where we interviewed over 100 entrepreneurs, Britt and Ali, my two co-founders ended up coming into the folds a few months after I kind of conceptualized it. And we were all in our first year university at that point. And basically we started interviewing, interviewing, interviewing. And started to build it up. Britt was an amazing at technical video production, recording, of anything web related. She was just really good at figuring things out. I tended to be more on the marketing and business development side, getting into interviews. And Ali was always really good at kind of tying those two worlds together in terms of content creation and brand, which neither Britt and I really have much of an eye for, I would say. So, it kind of worked out really well and we realized that we really loved working with each other. Although that came up with its ups and downs, sometimes being friends. Sometimes it's a little hard to be transparent when you're giving constructive feedback and that kind of stuff. And it was something, a challenge that we had to work around. But we ended up pivoting several times to try and make the magazine work. So, whether that was a website we design or whether it was pivoting the type of content. So, Interviewing entrepreneurs about their journey. Let's talk about their failures. And we tried to pivot and pivot and pivot and get an audience around it. And what we realized was just it wasn't working. And this was two years in, yeah, that's two and a half years in. We were incubated, a accelerator called the Trans Media Zone at Ryerson University in Toronto. And that was the point where they started to kind of sit us down and be like, all right, like you guys need to figure out what you're doing. This is clearly isn't working. Like your audience isn't growing so, what can you do. And at that point, we had luckily started experimenting with podcasting actually, as a way to interview entrepreneurs, and as an extension of this online magazine thing that we were trying to make. And at the time, I was also working full time, as well as also being in school, too. And while I was at my full time job, I was working in business development at a tech startup. And what I was doing was I would go find conferences and then I would basically try and find executives and essentially hunt them down at conferences to try and sell them our software at the booth. And that was pretty much my main role. And I just felt it was really inauthentic. It was awful. It was so terrible. And I remember always just feeling like there was something that I could be doing and that would create a better connection with someone. And that's actually where the idea for branded podcasts really sparked. Because I was like, what if you could put an executive and a startup in the same room together and they could talk about something related to it and that would actually build a genuine connection. And so, we ended up starting a show called The Tech Haus, which was our first ever original podcast as Origins Media House, which is the company that we eventually evolved into. And that's exactly what it was. We put Fortune 500 execs with startups talk about the future of technology and that show went okay. It didn't do great, It didn't do amazing, but still running. So, that's good. And while we were doing that, we realized, oh, well, maybe what's actually going to make the money here is if we got brands to pay us to make their shows for us. And so we pivoted again and then eventually found our niche. And the product market fit was really like getting brands to pay us to do full service production. And that's where we found our bread and butter. After four long years. That's a pretty fascinating thing. Thank you for sharing that. And I can't imagine how difficult it must be to be co-founding a startup with two of your best friends. I love the pivoting. I love the insights along the way. It's really just the pure entrepreneurial journey. So thank you very, very much for sharing that. What do you do today as head of production at Quill? Yeah, so head of production is an interesting role. I would say it was a little odd to transition from being a CEO into this role today. But now that it's been a few months, I actually I've really enjoyed it. It's great. It's a lot less stress and I'm really lucky to have an incredible team that I work with. But basically my role as head of production is basically to make sure that a show goes from initial idea and concept, mapping that out, making sure that there is going to be an audience for it as best as I can, and making sure that we're going to hit the goals with the concept that we have, building up the structure and then basically taking that and rolling it out to make sure that we execute it properly, making sure that everything gets booked in, making sure that the recordings go smoothly, making sure that the content is as good as it can be in the post-production and editing process. And then from there, working on distribution, making sure it goes smoothly onto all the platforms, and then also working on the second half of the challenge when you're creating a podcast, which is audience growth. So, working there and figuring out, okay, how do we look at the show not necessarily as just a podcast, an extension of a brand, but how do we look at a podcast as a brand in and of itself. And so then how do we grow an audience and a community around that's going to rally around this idea which then will feed back into your brand. I think a lot of people kind of look at it opposite to that. And at this point, I think we just start looking at podcasts and shows as brands in and of themselves. That's really interesting. I didn't think of podcasts in such a way until now. But it makes perfect sense from the similar experience that I've been having with this and it's been a lot of fun. So, I know quite a few people who are running podcasts. Now that we're talking about how big the market is getting. I am reflecting back and I'm realizing that I have a lot of friends that are starting podcast, that have already been running podcasts. What are some high level or low level pointers that we can provide to some of to myself and some of my friends on how to create a successful podcast? And when I say successful, I mean engaging with the right audience and having speaking to them and having them really interact with the content. Oh, yes. I love this question. So, there's a couple of different ways. And I always say it's almost like a road map that you should follow. And I actually pretty much stole this from building a business. But basically what you need to do, it's the first thing when you're starting a podcast is think about what are you trying to actually achieve. I think a lot of people, when they're starting a show, they're like, oh yeah. I'm just going to start a show and it'll be a fun side hustle. And it's like, okay, cool. But like, what's the point? At the end of the day, when things are really hard and you're going to have to edit for hours to make sure that the show gets out on time, what's going to make you go back to it and say, yes, this is worth it. Right? Because if you don't have that thing that is telling you that your show is worth doing and the time that you're putting into it is worth doing, then your show is going to flop. Because you're going to do maybe five to 10 episodes. You're going to be like, this is a lot of work. And that's going to be that. Unless you go and hire someone, which most indie podcasters won't, because this is generally can be very expensive to hire someone unless you're just doing parts of the process, maybe like you're outsourcing another here. But anyways, so, first things first. Start with the goal. Next, what you want to do is you want to think about your ILP or your Ideal Listener Profile. And so full disclosure, I fully stole this from ideal customer profile. But what you want to do is map out who exactly your target listener is. So, who are they, what age are they, what gender are they, what are their hobbies, what are their interests, why do they want to listen to this podcast, what are their motivators in life, like, what do they need to hear from you. Essentially, what are their behaviors every day, like what are their hobbies. I want to know all of that. Because then when you're talking and shaping the content and the structure, you're going to know what's going to engage them better because you're thinking of it from a listeners first standpoint. And a lot of podcasters that I think also start from this place of I'm going to start with me and I'm going to start with my content and what I want, instead of thinking about, well, what do the listeners want, what does the audience want. Right? And just like a company, if you start a company and you say, I want to build a product because I like it and you're not considering what your customers want, it's not going to be very successful. Right? And so, it's the same thing with podcasting. You have to look at it from a listener standpoint. Your listeners are your customers at the end of the day. And then from there, once you have kind of like your ideal listener profile mapped out, can be like a two pager, it's fine. One pager even. Then, what I like to do and what we do at Quill is we do a positioning or a competitive matrix. So, take a look at the type of show that you're thinking you're going to create. Right? By this point, you kind of probably thinking you have a concept, you know what category it's going to be. Let's say it's an entrepreneurship podcast like this one. And look at the category. So the entrepreneurship category on Apple will be like, okay, what are the top podcasts in my category. Map it out, maybe do like six or seven. However many you want. And then take a look and think about them in terms of show duration, in terms of post engagement, think about their structure and rip them apart and be like, okay, what did I do really, really well and what did I not do really well. What did I not engage with and then map it all out and find the patterns. So, find the patterns of what they're all not doing well or what listeners aren't necessarily getting from the top shows in your category and then provide that value. So, that's basically my philosophy on how to create a successful show, because once you have all of those pieces together, you can map out a structure that's going to be effective and engaging for your listeners. And also, just another side note, a lot of people also that I've met that are doing podcasts, generally, people think of it as a sprint and not a marathon. And podcasting, when you put out your first episode, it's okay to have fifty listeners. You're not going to have thousands and thousands of people listening to you right off the bat. That's totally fine because listeners accumulate over time. The whole idea of podcast is you need to be consistent and constantly putting episode out, episode out, episodes out. Right? And then your audience will build over time as people discover you, as you get more guys, as you get more exposure. And so just because you put out 10 episodes and maybe you only have like 3,000 listeners on the entire show. That's actually not necessarily a bad thing, just keep going and keep going, and then eventually you'll do 20 and then maybe you'll have 6,000 or even 10,000 by then. And then that's metrics that you can get behind and you can present to sponsors, if that's what you're looking for. So, yeah, that's basically my general advice for podcasting. I think I'm definitely going to take that to heart. And obviously, even once you have the whole structure in the envelope around it, you still do the hard work of actually producing quality content and having fun. And I think that when I thought about going into this project myself, I never thought of it as quitting a podcast or quitting a show. I thought of it, how can I engage with really interesting  people in all sorts of industries and get their nuggets and insights from their life. Things that I am truly interested in, having a truly fascinating conversation for me. And, you know, by association, a lot of my friends that are also like minded with me, will also be interested. But Steph, I really want to thank you for being so generous with your time. It's been really, really wonderful and very insightful. So thank you. And before we leave, I have to ask you for three words that you would use to describe yourself. Oh, Lord, I have to think about it. Even though I've had like a full half and an hour to think about it because you told me that you would ask this question. All right. So, I'd say the first word. Oh, Okay. I'd say the first word is probably, ambitious, I guess. The second word I would say is connected. I generally like not connected in the sense of being well connected. But I would say my biggest curiosity in life is how people connect to one another and how we connect to the world around us. So, I'd say that's a big one for me. And the third one, I would say quirky, I guess. I don't know. I love that. People have told me that a lot. So there you go. That's perfect. Steph, thank you very much. Stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you. Yes, you too. Thank you.
