1 It always looks like a disaster. We've done this, oh, my God. Our clients say that we're not going to make it, we have to fire someone and everything. If you look at it in the test of, like a long period of time, everything works out. Yoav Vilner, thank you so much for being on my show, 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? Great. Thanks for inviting me. Of course. I have to say that it's a beautiful balcony that you have over there in Tel Aviv. But I do have to start with actually with your fun fact, which is the fact that you play the ukulele. And you showed it to me just a second ago behind you there. We started with that fun fact. Now, I know how to play What A Wonderful World. I taught myself that. It took me about three years to learn it. So, I have a lot of respect to the fact that you claim that you play the ukulele. But I want to spend these 20 minutes talking about you and your journey. As we get to the climax of the conversation, your most recent company, Walnut. I'd love to go back in time in to your 20s. Sales, marketing, leadership, starting your own businesses, New York City, Tel Aviv, walk me through your journey. Because I think there's a lot to, a lot of lessons to be learned about your entrepreneurial journey. Right. So, I started my career by accident when I was 22. I wanted to do freelance marketing for startups. And, you know, 10 years ago, the startup nation was a little bit smaller, so there was room to do that and be the first one. So, I did that and it turned out to be the biggest company in Israel to do that. We had like 500 clients, dozens of employees and offices in Manhattan and London. So, I had to live in London and Manhattan like periodically. And it was a lot of fun. And after seven years of being the CEO, I decided I needed to do something more, something different, like have more fun. Yoav, your skipping over all over the juicy parts. You're 22 years old, how do you get to run a company that has over 500 clients, with offices in three continents? I don't understand that. You know, I always try to think of a good word to say. I was a very shitty CEO to start with. I had employees that were double my age and they had kids of their own. And I've made every mistake possible. But you just want to, what our life in Israel, the university of life you have to go through it much more than anybody. And it's worked out. So, going back, what were some of the most monumental moments or your aha moments as you were going through this company, and you're managing the company first for seven years, what were some of the most incredible milestones that you'll forever keep with you? I think the first one is quit your job. Because I had a very good job when I was like 21, 22 when I came back from my after army trip, which was a year long in Central America. And I had a really good job. Like my friends were like, "How the hell did you get the job, while we're trying to figure out where we're going to study for the next four years?" But I just quit it because I wanted to be like be my own boss. So, that was probably the smartest move I've ever made. And it changed my life. Yeah. And the other thing is, don't worry about being a very bad founder and CEO when you're in early 20s, that's when you have to make all the mistakes. But when you get a little bit better, and older and better and older, then you're going to be amazing and have much better background. And people who have done an amazing degree and they were VPs at some enterprise companies, you're probably going to beat them for being the founder. So, from your experience, what are some of the most important things one can do as a young entrepreneur, first time entrepreneur, and in owning those mistakes? And obviously, we're all going to make mistakes. And I'm looking forward to making many more mistakes than I'm already making as I go through my entrepreneurial journey. But what do we need to do in order to keep that in mind and to own them and to fix them? You need to start by doing them. And then, you know, building a startup, it's like every day it's the worst mistake than before in every phase of the startup. So, I have to do it. And if you don't do it, it's like in the gym, If it doesn't hurt, then you're not improving. So, that's the only way. You need to find yourself people that you look up to, and you can give them a call, give them a WhatsApp message, annoy them and ask them for, usually people that are just a bit  older from you, they have like an experience running a company a little bit better than you. Surround yourself with those people. And eventually, everything always looks like a disaster. We've done this. Oh my God. Our clients say that we're not going to make it, we have to fire someone, and everything. If you look at it, in the test of a long period of time, everything works out. You just got to be a little bit less emotional. Right. Okay. So, then let's continue in your journey. You're seven years in, and you have hundreds of clients, what are some of the most important insights you learned about marketing and PR through that experience? Now you're taking a topic that can be 10 hours, and you're asking that one question. That's what's so smart about this show, because I get to now skip nine hours of studying for that one sentence that everybody's looking for. Now, of course, there's no magical answer. No, I have a lot. I would say that, I was also like an adviser to most of the different accelerators that you probably know. And I think, what I usually told the founders in terms of early stage marketing is that you've got to try and be your own [--]. So, if you're the CEO of the startup and you start building your own reputation, like you create guest articles on the big publications. At some point of time of my life I was writing for, like 10 US publications. Really? Yeah. Like CNBC, Forbes, Fox news. So, you might not be able to do all of that, but you can definitely work on a couple of channels that will brand you as like the founder of that company. And then, when you need to raise your announcement, like raise seed and all that, you're going to be already closed to the media. So you're not gonna need about agencies. That's actually a really, really good tip. I'm going to keep that in mind. And I think it's you know, I keep following the writing that you get and you do, but also the people that are writing in. And it always makes me [--] that I really want to get into that, because it's not just about getting your name on those publications, but it forces you to think critically about some topics and to put that thinking into words that can be meaningful for others. So, I think that it's definitely something that I'm looking forward to. So, you're writing these publications, You have that agency with hundreds of clients, and what's next on your journey, on the way to becoming the CEO of Walnut? So, you know, I was in New York for like almost a year and I just realized that a marketing company is nice, but if you don't have 200 employees and your own building, that American audience and companies don't really give a shit. So, I had to start really encourage me to start thinking about my next moves. So, I came back to Israel and I took some time off. It was a very long seven years. I took some time off. And then we formed the startup that was designed to save kids from pedophiles on social media. Right. So, it was me and three more founding members, [--] the people probably know. And after another year of doing that, which is a great cause and I hope they succeed. Just I felt that it's a perfect time for, then corona started, people started switching their mindset. And I just realized, that was the perfect time for me to start my own thing again. And I'm the founder, co-founder, CEO, and that was the beginning of Walnut. So, I want to hold on, on this junction. Because now you're at a point in time where you've had an agency, you have had a very successful business you grew with your bare hands in three continents with dozens of employees and offices. You've seen what that journey is like and what selling and getting to a good product is like. Then you're part of the founding team of a company that is growing very, very quickly, raised a lot of money with a very well-known and respected CEO with a great cause, and you're deciding to go back to the drawing board and to create a company from scratch, Walnut. Was it that you just had to create something of your own, like have your own baby? Was it that you wanted to really see what it's like to be that CEO of a hypergrowth startup? What was it that really attracted you? That's an amazing question. I think it was a combination of, I think everyone's life has changed a little bit, like seven months ago or eight months ago. And for me I felt the change, the main thoughts that I had while we were quarantined during March, were that I have to do my own thing again. I have to name it. I have to decide what the product is going to do. And it just felt right. And I don't really know how to explain it. It just felt right. I just do it like before, which I've done always. So, I decided that I'm going to pursue what I'm feeling. And everything, kind of like all of the stars aligned ever since. It was really starting off with the right foot. I have to say that I'm drawing a parallel to a lot of the other interviews that I've had on the show. Almost every guest comes with a non-linear career path. And almost always, the recurring theme is that they had this gut feeling like the one you're describing that says, Michael, I can't really explain it in words. I had to do it. That it was you know, they said that entrepreneurs are crazy. And I think that's part of the insanity. Right? Feeling like you have to go with your heart. It's a bug. It's a bug. Walnut. What's walnut? Right. So, I left my previous startup. And Danni, my co-founder, who is a brilliant technology guy, he sold like two startups and then he oversaw like 70 something developers that we work. He kind of was looking for, we were just kind of imploded. And he was looking also to start his next thing. And we started, it wasn't a matter of ideation, which is the process that I hate the most when you start a new company, because it's a never ending process. There's no idea that [--] every day, all day. We were both kind of excited about this whole thing of revolutionizing how companies present themselves to other companies. And we just started building and [--], and interviewed 60 enterprise companies and saw what they would probably pay for if we build. And everything just started off like a serious roller coaster since. So, you mentioned very briefly the industry of showing your product to others or demoing your product. And when we had a really nice walk on Ben-Gurion Street, you really explained to me the pain point behind a team's ability to present their product to another team, live. So, talk to me a little bit about the space and why is Walnut so relevant in 2020? So, 2020 is the year where everything's done remote, so. And during the regular times, let's say, of the previous year, before corona, companies always have like a lot of friction between the sales team and the back end. So, the sales team has to ask the designer to design something, not to touch the back end so it doesn't break. Add a feature into it. And, you know, it's like a cross-cultural problem. I think companies has that problem. It doesn't matter who you are, It doesn't matter what's the size. So, we started building like an editor, like you would edit a website on WIX, and it's on our cloud. So, you edit the sales demo and it's unbreakable because it's on a CDM. And we just started building it. We showed it to a lot of companies, everyone wanted to hire us. And then we raised seed this takes like a month, and went from some of the investors that I consider to be the best around. And now, we're growing the team, onboarding clients. And that's amazing. So, give me a little bit more insight into this product and the actual experience. So, you mentioned that one of the interesting solutions that you've discovered here is that you can actually disintegrate the sales team from the product and back-end team, such that the sales team can write their own demos without having to interface with the back-end team and without blocking each other. So, is this like, you know, just like a demo where you recorded and then you show it? Or is it a live demo where you can play around with it? Because obviously, you want to play around with the demo live in front of clients. So, it's not a video and it's not a screenshot and it's not a mock up. It's an actual, touchable, it's a product that the sales people had to dive in like two minutes before the call and customize. If we personalize everything, the only reason that Netflix beat all the big movie producers and Hollywood directors is that because it gives us a lot of customization. And we build our [--], and it's all very reachable. So, that's a big difference. When you're selling a product, it has to be customized to the client you're showing it to. And we just gave them that tool. And we realized that there is too much of a demand than we can handle. Because we launched and we got like, almost a thousand companies to reach out in like a month. And yeah. And pretty much, the most amazing companies that you can imagine, I don't want to name them, but pretty much the biggest enterprise companies in the world. Sometimes it was two different teams from the same company reaching out, not minding the others have reached out. So, we've proven that there's a problem. And all of this in how long since the inception? Seven months, maybe. Seven months. That's unbelievable. So, walk me through the first seven months of, you know, a fast growing startup, you're the CEO, what's bothering you? Like, what makes you tick before you go to sleep? My phone. You know, it's like a never ending, it's a never ending ordeal. Yoav, you seem too calm. You're too relaxed. Like, I'm nervous for you. You're growing so fast, you're onboarding more employees, you have a thousand companies waiting in line, and you're sitting there relaxed and saying, yes, I'm enjoying it. Yeah, I had something to drink before we got on this topic. I learned that for the next one. No, if you're pressured, and if you're relax, you're going to reach pretty much the same problem. So, I have no choice. But during the day, like nights like 9PM at night, during the day, we're working in a rollercoaster, like everyone's working their ass off. And, you know, at nights we talk to the American companies, investors and everyone. Right. Yeah. You know, it's a lot of fun. I think it's the most fun I've had in all of my career, honestly. It's so fun and inspiring for me to be talking to somebody who's already had a marvelous career and has impacted on so many organizations. And now you're saying that, that literally now is the most fun you're having. That just makes me want to go and start my own thing already. What surprised you over these seven months? What caught you off guard that you're like, oh, wow, I didn't realize this before? I was afraid because it was like a crisis and people were holding on to their jobs. I was afraid that it's going to be hard for us to recruit the talent. And now it's easier because we had PR about us and we raised money. But before we actually raised the money, I was really surprised at how people were loyal to working or joining our team like our founding team, even before there was the first investor in, even before the first client was in. And we're very grateful to them. Some of the best people I know, they have like 10, 15 years down the road in the industry. And I'm really proud of the team that we've built. Now, it's going to be harder because when you've done working with your first circle of friends of friends, you're starting to grow and be, you know, 10, 15, 20, 30, and you've got to hire people you don't know, your friends don't know, your colleagues don't know, and it's getting to be more skeptical But also, it happened to me too like two times already before. So, I hope it'll be fine again. Right. And Yoav, usually at this point of the conversation, I ask, what is some advice you would give to a young entrepreneur like myself as I am gearing up towards starting my own. But what I'm taking away from this conversation is both, you know, quit your job, especially if it means following your heart and if you're doing something, because sometimes, not always, but sometimes the end result is you're able to say that you're having the most fun you ever had in your life or in your career. And obviously, anybody who's looking at the stats of what you've been doing the past seven months can see what an incredible journey this has been for you. Especially during a crisis that, that basically immobilized most of the startups in the world. So, I think that's pretty exciting. Yoav, before we go, though, I have to ask for three words that you would use to describe yourself, or three words that your co-founder or one of your team members would use to describe you. Should have done my homework and prepare some. No, no, spontaneous is the key. Three words, I would say emotional. I didn't expect that. Not in my personal life, but when building a startup, I'm very emotional which is not good. I think my team members would use a name to describe me, that's someone that's making it complicated to order lunch. Undeciding. And also a little bit being late to places all the time. But besides that, I think I'm a really decent guy. Yoav, you definitely are. And I very much appreciate our friendship, and I learn a lot from you. So, thank you for both giving the time to do this show and for teaching me throughout the journey. And it's been a lot of fun following you, and I can't wait to follow Walnut and the things you're doing. And other than that, I just have to wish you to stay safe and stay healthy. Likewise. And then good luck with your book. Everyone going to buy it. That's awesome. Thank you, Yoav. Take care. Bye bye.
