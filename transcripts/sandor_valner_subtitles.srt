1
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,800
Wonderful. Okay.

2
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,520
Sandor Valner, thank you so much

3
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,800
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

4
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,560
Thank you.

5
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,640
Best to be here, buddy.

6
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,000
So good to have you.

7
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,640
So, we know each other

8
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,680
through the J-Ventures Fund.

9
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,600
You're actually, you just told me

10
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,200
you're considered now a rabbi

11
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:47,000
for the J-Ventures opening up

12
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,680
the LA chapter, which is wonderful.

13
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,680
And I get to work with your wonderful son

14
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,840
as an associate at the Firm and Center.

15
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,640
I'd love to spend these 20 minutes

16
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,160
getting to know two things that really

17
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,080
I know nothing about.

18
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:01,280
Investment banking in Latin America.

19
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,200
You're from Mexico.

20
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,160
You actually, though,

21
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,320
you've got to study in Mexico,

22
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,000
in Weizmann institute

23
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:09,040
and at Stanford University,

24
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,400
both AI and business.

25
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,920
And then, you go to investment banking.

26
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,040
So, you're gonna have to give me

27
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,160
a little bit of a rundown

28
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,880
how that all happened.

29
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,680
I'm gonna let you go from now on.

30
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:21,200
Sandor, talk to me a little bit

31
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,440
about your background

32
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,240
and where you came from.

33
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,320
Sure. Born and raised in Mexico,

34
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:31,160
Lithuanian people who escaped the war

35
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:32,560
coming to the United States.

36
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,800
Couldn't get into the United States.

37
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,000
Stopped in Mexico, liked it there

38
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,960
and stayed there.

39
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,760
We were raised in Mexico.

40
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,800
And then, started schooling

41
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:45,680
initially in Mexico.

42
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:47,320
Then went to the Machon Weizmann

43
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:48,360
for a year.

44
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,520
Where in Mexico did you live?

45
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,560
Mexico City.

46
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,760
I was just there for a week

47
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,000
with my good friend from Stanford, Santiago.

48
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,960
Beautiful place.

49
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,320
It's a great city.

50
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,400
I highly recommend it.

51
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,560
Great food, great people.

52
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,360
Very Israeli, right?

53
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,880
I found the people there to be

54
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,720
very similar to Israelis in Tel Aviv.

55
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,840
Well, it's a fun city.

56
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:13,440
I highly recommend it

57
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,120
once we got in to normalcy again,

58
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,200
I highly recommend it.

59
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:17,880
Definitely.

60
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:23,320
So, then went to school in Mexico,

61
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,440
studied engineering.

62
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,560
Then went to Stanford and studied both

63
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,400
business and artificial intelligence.

64
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,080
Before artificial intelligence was

65
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,360
what we now know

66
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,840
artificial intelligence is.

67
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,880
But needless to say

68
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,080
it was very interesting.

69
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,560
And then, I started a career of 15 years

70
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,440
in investment banking, doing mostly

71
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,040
international mergers and acquisitions.

72
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,080
And then, shifted my career into

73
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,880
private equity real estate.

74
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:56,160
Managed large private equity

75
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,560
real estate funds,

76
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,000
also, mostly internationally.

77
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,800
And sold my interests

78
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:07,080
in the real estate company last year.

79
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,920
And I've since been doing angel investing

80
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,440
mostly in PropTech and FinTech.

81
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,320
And now I'm starting a new

82
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:18,440
tech-enabled investment banking.

83
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,160
Amazing. Okay.

84
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,600
So, Sandor, I'd love to talk about

85
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,520
this intersection of,

86
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:25,400
you're in real estate for a long time.

87
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,920
You're an expert in real estate now.

88
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,760
Just from my understanding,

89
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,440
when you did that,

90
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,240
there was traditional real estate, right?

91
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,360
Not necessarily techy, AI powered

92
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,520
in real estate investing, right?

93
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,400
Yeah. This was traditional real estate.

94
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,000
We did mostly industrial facilities,

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,040
and we did a low income housing,

96
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,680
and we did offices and shopping centers.

97
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,040
Nothing related to tech.

98
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,920
How big are we talking here?

99
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,200
Is this one or two buildings?

100
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,120
Or is this 50, 60 buildings?

101
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,920
What's more, what we raised up

102
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,720
close to two billion dollars

103
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,280
and then we we ended up,

104
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,480
I don't know how many properties,

105
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,480
but probably a couple of hundred.

106
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,880
Wow. So, managing two billion dollars

107
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,920
in real estate. Is that right?

108
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:14,480
Yes, we've manage

109
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:17,000
public and private funds.

110
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,680
This was part of a larger organization.

111
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:25,360
What I was responsible, the funds,

112
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,120
the two billion dollars that I managed

113
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,160
were in Latin America.

114
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,160
So, it was an interesting ride.

115
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:34,400
Because this crisis

116
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:35,920
that we're living right now,

117
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:39,880
I think is my eighth crisis,

118
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,120
in terms of financial crisis.

119
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,120
These countries, particularly Mexico,

120
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,600
was having crisis every six years.

121
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,000
So, unfortunately,

122
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:52,520
I've learned to live

123
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,560
through a lot of them.

124
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,880
And I can only say to your audience

125
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,400
that we're probably gonna have

126
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,760
more of them, unfortunately.

127
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,440
Sandor, what have you learned

128
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,600
after a crisis?

129
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:05,240
Well, I've learned that

130
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,160
most of the fortunes,

131
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,680
on the economic side

132
00:07:08,681 --> 00:07:11,200
are made in the crisis.

133
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:14,800
My GSB professor last quarter told me,

134
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,480
"Michael, don't waste a good crisis."

135
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,480
Absolutely. Absolutely.

136
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,520
The other thing is that I think,

137
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,480
the biggest learning experiences

138
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,680
are during the crisis.

139
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:26,640
Which is very intense periods

140
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,720
where you are forced to really

141
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,400
go back to basics.

142
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,600
So, in terms of learning

143
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,000
and in terms of eventually making money,

144
00:07:37,001 --> 00:07:38,640
even though it seems

145
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:41,720
extremely hard at the time,

146
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,600
or carving a successful career,

147
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,440
obviously, it's not only about money.

148
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,120
They're just very good opportunities.

149
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,760
So, when you're in the middle

150
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,400
of the storm,

151
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,880
they're no fun.

152
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,960
Right. Definitely.

153
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,680
Okay. So, now, going back to this idea,

154
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,520
you're managing two billion dollars

155
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,600
in real estate assets.

156
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:04,760
And now you're investing in in startups

157
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,600
that are doing PropTech.

158
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,080
So, what is property technology?

159
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,080
And what specifically about it

160
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,520
makes you excited, with your expertise

161
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,920
looking at real estate as a whole?

162
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,720
Well, I think what happened

163
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,200
when I left private equity real estate,

164
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,160
during my years investing in real estate

165
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,920
I just found that it's an industry

166
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:31,280
that is very opaque, very inefficient,

167
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,160
and there are many many dimensions

168
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,320
which of real estate,

169
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,120
which I think can be improved

170
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,400
with technology.

171
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,440
What are some of  the really,

172
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,560
like, opaque parts of it?

173
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,800
Well, pricing, right?

174
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:54,520
When you lease a space, office space,

175
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,480
you don't really know

176
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,400
what everything else is leasing for.

177
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,880
You don't really know

178
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,440
what the terms of the lease

179
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,400
are for competitors.

180
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,360
You don't know

181
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,960
who's doing what as you do.

182
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,760
For example, in the stock market,

183
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,760
where there is a very liquid

184
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,840
and transparent market.

185
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,880
And I think at the end of the day,

186
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,880
a lack of liquidity and transparency

187
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,160
and all this friction

188
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,720
ends up costing everybody.

189
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,320
So, I think we would all be better off

190
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:32,360
if we had a more fluid system.

191
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,800
Okay. So we're talking about pricing.

192
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,240
This idea that you're able

193
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,440
to leverage deep technology

194
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,120
to really understand markets

195
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,280
and understand how to price better.

196
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,000
Are there other aspects of real estate

197
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,760
that technology can really go into?

198
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,960
Many. For example,

199
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,520
I'm an investor in a company

200
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,960
that is looking to disrupt

201
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:54,160
the construction management industry.

202
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,600
And the construction management,

203
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,880
you've got architects, engineers,

204
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,080
the owners, the bankers,

205
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:03,200
the accountants, the contractors.

206
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,720
Everyone interacting,

207
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,920
And they don't interact

208
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,240
in a single platform.

209
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,720
So, everybody speaks different languages.

210
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,120
Decisions take forever.

211
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,680
There are a lot of inefficiencies.

212
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,840
We're trying to build a company that will,

213
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,000
it's a collaboration tool where

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,160
everybody can share information real time

215
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,280
and increase efficiencies in construction.

216
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,640
Right. Actually, this year,

217
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,080
two friends of mine from the GSB

218
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,440
were working on a product where

219
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:37,120
they came with a hypothesis that

220
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,280
they can look at email conversations

221
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:41,880
between contractors, architects

222
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,680
and builders and find and predict

223
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,960
how much the project

224
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,120
is going to be delayed

225
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:51,360
so that they can warn in advance.

226
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,880
Because usually a delay means

227
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,720
more money, right?

228
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,200
I haven't done construction myself,

229
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,120
but from my understanding,

230
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,480
a delay means money.

231
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,200
And so, if you can predict ahead of time

232
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,720
that there's poor communication

233
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,400
and therefore delay is gonna come about,

234
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:04,360
you can actually save

235
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,480
quite a bit of money.

236
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,880
And I think more importantly,

237
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,280
you're gonna save quite a bit of headache

238
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,680
for all parties.

239
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,080
Please ask your friends to give me a call.

240
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,760
Because we're trying to build really

241
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,480
a platform to do exactly that.

242
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,640
To predict delays,

243
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,040
avoid delays and cost overruns.

244
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,520
I'm going to because I actually believe,

245
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,920
that one of the founders,

246
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,200
she did her PhD on this.

247
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,600
And she actually already had it

248
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,080
something working.

249
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,920
So, something positive

250
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,880
already came out of this talk.

251
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,800
But Sandor, back to you.

252
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,040
You're dealing with this,

253
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,520
you're also part of J-Ventures.

254
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,000
Why go into real estate

255
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,120
in the first place?

256
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,640
What got you excited about real estate?

257
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,000
And why real estate in Mexico?

258
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,680
Why not in the US, Europe, Israel?

259
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,360
Why Mexico?

260
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:50,600
Well, why Mexico?

261
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,440
Because I happened to be born there.

262
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,280
And my family have historically been

263
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,760
in real estate.

264
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,360
And I had kind of been riding

265
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:02,320
in real estate.

266
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:06,440
And so, it's a nice business

267
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
and a stable business.

268
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,760
And it also offers the possibility

269
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,880
of creating a lot of jobs

270
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,560
and improving the standard of living

271
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,440
of wherever your acting.

272
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,160
And again, I  I thought that

273
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,200
it was an industry

274
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,000
that is fairly inefficient.

275
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,480
And where there inefficiencies

276
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,520
there are opportunities to have fun,

277
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,960
to innovate, to make money, etc.

278
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,520
Right. Okay.

279
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,160
Now, you have your own startup.

280
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,000
Talk to me a little bit about this one.

281
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,200
Yes. We created a company

282
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,160
called Network Bankers.

283
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,720
It's a tech-enabled investment bank.

284
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,960
We put together,

285
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,200
We now have a network of over 30,000 CEOs

286
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,960
around the world

287
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,040
that are part of our network.

288
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,280
And we're providing investment banking

289
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,440
and investment management services

290
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:07,520
to that group of 30,000 CEOs.

291
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,720
So, what does that mean

292
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,680
investment banking services?

293
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,560
So, basically, investment banking,

294
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,200
what I mean by

295
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,400
investment banking services

296
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,440
in this context is helping these CEOs.

297
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:22,320
Advising them on raising capital,

298
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,320
raising debt,

299
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:26,680
or helping them buy or sell companies.

300
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,440
Okay. Okay.

301
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,160
So, these are not CEOs necessarily

302
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,720
of early stage startups

303
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:33,480
that are just raising

304
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,720
a few hundred thousand dollars.

305
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,560
And I'm guessing these are,

306
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,520
later on in their lifecycle.

307
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,440
They are, I mean, there's certainly

308
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,280
there's some startup CEOs where we can

309
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,640
help them raise venture capital money.

310
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:50,800
But most of these CEOs manage

311
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:55,120
small or middle sized companies.

312
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,400
And some of them manage

313
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,160
hundred million dollar companies plus,

314
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:02,480
but most of them are smaller.

315
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,920
And we will help them reach their goals

316
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,320
by helping them buy other companies out

317
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,040
or selling divisions or raising capital.

318
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,800
Or their financial engineers,

319
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:19,040
helping them accomplish their goals.

320
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,080
Sure. I have to know,

321
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,760
what are some of the biggest challenges

322
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:27,120
of managing hundreds of assets

323
00:14:27,121 --> 00:14:28,640
in real estate?

324
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,560
How often do you know their values?

325
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,960
Because the values are fluctuating

326
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,960
especially as in the recent years

327
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,720
with the crisis all the way from 2008

328
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,640
up to now,

329
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,680
how do you even get a good grasp

330
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,160
of your holdings?

331
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,160
In my mind, I'm imagining

332
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,880
a team of 100 analysts sitting all day

333
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,040
and just doing calculations.

334
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,320
Is that the case or are there

335
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,000
different approaches to this?

336
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,280
Well, I mean, you asked several questions.

337
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,240
One of the questions you asked

338
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,920
is about pricing.

339
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,400
You don't know about price.

340
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,920
That is one of limitations of real estate.

341
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,240
You have indications about what's going on

342
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,640
in the markets, but you don't know

343
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:11,240
how much your assets are worth.

344
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,160
You can't just look at what the guy

345
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,240
next to you sold for?

346
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,450
Is that not good enough?

347
00:15:15,451 --> 00:15:17,200
You could. But there are just,

348
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,440
the transactions are few and far between.

349
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,840
It's not like the stock market

350
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,960
where you have millions of shares

351
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,080
that are trading every day.

352
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,280
So, the transactions are limited.

353
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,960
But in real estate,

354
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,560
the one thing you do have is that

355
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,480
they tend to be large and discrete assets.

356
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,040
So, you can have a team of

357
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:40,400
two or three people that are monitoring

358
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,240
the management of a office building

359
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,520
or shopping center.

360
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:50,040
And the real estate has typically

361
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,040
you have a team in the real estate fund.

362
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,240
You have a team that does,

363
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,680
for example, acquisitions.

364
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,320
Basically, you evaluate new investments

365
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,440
and then you have another team

366
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,800
that does asset management,

367
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,720
which really means that you have a team

368
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,680
that is monitoring

369
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,000
your existing investments.

370
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,960
They're making sure that the offices

371
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,880
are well managed.

372
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,760
That their lease,

373
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,920
that they have adequate debt, etc, etc.

374
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,680
So, you have an external team

375
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,920
that even though these funds

376
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,640
tend to be rather small funds,

377
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:25,040
we tend to outsource

378
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,840
a lot of this asset management,

379
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,360
so you end up having hundreds of people,

380
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,040
as you'd say,

381
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,720
monitoring all of these assets.

382
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:33,920
Not directly employed by the funds,

383
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,080
but indirectly from

384
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:37,520
asset management companies.

385
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,600
Right. Right.

386
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,120
Did this studying AI in the

387
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,520
engineering school of Stanford

388
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,040
and of course, the business school,

389
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,600
did that bring a different paradigm

390
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,560
to your thinking

391
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,340
behind running the business

392
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,160
or how to leverage different technologies

393
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,160
to help you?

394
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,400
How do you see that education

395
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,000
or that part of yourself

396
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,720
and your background

397
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,159
play into the role of this

398
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,759
green investment banking endeavors?

399
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,040
Well, I think

400
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,760
the computer science background

401
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:10,240
helped me organize my thoughts

402
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,360
and helped me look into things

403
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,520
as to how they can be scaled

404
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:19,030
and automated.

405
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,440
I think, in the back of my mind,

406
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,440
I always had that whenever I have a big

407
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,510
or difficult problem came about,

408
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,920
AI didn't really play much of a role

409
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:37,400
because when I studied AI in 1985 or so,

410
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,960
you didn't have the algorithms

411
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,350
that you have right now.

412
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,000
The learning algorithms just didn't exist.

413
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,440
So, it was actually a very frustrated

414
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,320
that we were a little bit

415
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,280
ahead of our times

416
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,790
in terms of technology to do much.

417
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,000
We didn't have the computer power.

418
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,440
We didn't really have a knowledge

419
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,350
of the required algorithms.

420
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,520
So, to me, it was actually enlightening.

421
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,000
It was really exciting.

422
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,960
Once I left real estate,

423
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,160
I discover these new things

424
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,400
that have been,

425
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,080
we've developed an artificial intelligence

426
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,350
that now I can, I have a new toy

427
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,720
that I can play with, right?

428
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,750
I mean, this is a fascinating technology.

429
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,070
Incredible.

430
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,320
So, I'm really like,

431
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,280
if you're like the young kid

432
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,280
with a new toy

433
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:27,830
trying to explore something different.

434
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,040
And going back to the beginning

435
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,080
of the conversation,

436
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,200
trying to piece

437
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,160
all of the different parts of my career

438
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,600
into something that makes sense,

439
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
which probably never will make sense.

440
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,040
But it's an interesting jigsaw puzzle

441
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,510
that you assemble throughout your career.

442
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,000
But it's been a lot of fun.

443
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,040
Definitely. I go into our

444
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,000
computer vision course website,

445
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:55,480
the notorious CS231n,

446
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,320
it's the graduate school class

447
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,040
for  convolutional neural networks

448
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,240
for computer vision.

449
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,320
And the first thing that you see

450
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,400
on the website is a neural network

451
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:08,080
that is able to take an image

452
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,240
and classify it.

453
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,600
And it's running on the browser.

454
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,040
And I can just imagine, to me,

455
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,280
coming in as a new student

456
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:14,600
and seeing this fresh

457
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,360
and having all the tools at my disposal

458
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,560
with a few lines of code

459
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,240
and my own personal computer,

460
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,280
whether it's amazing

461
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,160
or whether it's crappy,

462
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,440
I can still run all those algorithms.

463
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,920
Even on my phone.

464
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,840
I'm sure it's a very different

465
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,240
learning experience than in 1980 to 1984

466
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,110
and learning about these algorithms.

467
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,160
Sandor, I'm very curious,  looking from up

468
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,400
from very high to now going down,

469
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,120
buying real estate, also especially

470
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,240
for young individuals,

471
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,070
all the time you hear in the news about

472
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,040
the American dream to own a house,

473
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,880
to own an apartment.

474
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,000
Israel, also a people my age

475
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,280
are constantly thinking about,

476
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,080
"Okay, when I'm finally going to be able

477
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,550
to make my first real estate investment?"

478
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,680
What is your take on this?

479
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,120
Is this a rational thing to do

480
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,480
as a young person to go in

481
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,160
and run after a real estate investment?

482
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,680
Is it better in your mind

483
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:06,680
to put it somewhere else?

484
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,030
Or is it just like a sexy fad

485
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,310
or is there a real meaning behind it?

486
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,680
Well, I think you have to go back

487
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,240
to basics.

488
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,760
Real estate has been

489
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,800
a relatively stable asset.

490
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,960
That doesn't mean that it's not

491
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,030
has its risks.

492
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,320
But as long as you don't have

493
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,000
a lot of leverage of debt on it,

494
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,920
so, a very stable asset.

495
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,920
But going back to basics, I mean,

496
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,520
one of the things

497
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,760
that these crisis teach you

498
00:20:33,761 --> 00:20:36,310
is that you should save, right?

499
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,480
You really should save for a rainy day

500
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,560
because you don't really know

501
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,200
when we're gonna be quarantined

502
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,200
or when there's going to be a slowdown

503
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,720
or when you're out of your job, etc.

504
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,760
Second thing you learn is that

505
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,590
you really need to diversify your assets.

506
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,560
So, your urge to be invested

507
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,550
in real estate, that's great.

508
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,040
But I don't think anyone

509
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,320
should have 99% of their assets

510
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,720
in real estate.

511
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,510
Even though I love real estate, right?

512
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,160
I mean, you should diversify.

513
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,800
Why? Because you shouldn't have

514
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,040
all your eggs in one basket.

515
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,760
You should have it in a few baskets

516
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,400
because things happen, right?

517
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,070
Right.

518
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,310
But all in all, real estate,

519
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,270
One is, an investment is stable.

520
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,790
It certainly plays a role.

521
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,040
But more importantly,

522
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,960
it's your house, right?

523
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,880
So, you use it and you should enjoy it.

524
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,720
And fortunately, in this country,

525
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,080
which, by the way, is not the case

526
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,960
in most countries in the world,

527
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,440
the loan rates, the interest rates

528
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,920
are so low that a lot of people can afford

529
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,720
buying houses even if they're small

530
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,440
at the beginning.

531
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,560
This is not the case

532
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,510
in many many countries.

533
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,400
Right.

534
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,000
Unfortunately, these crisis

535
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,400
make houses less affordable.

536
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,040
So, it's tougher.

537
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,680
But this is a tough time.

538
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:57,400
But we're gonna have

539
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:58,880
better times as well.

540
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,000
So, be patient.

541
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,120
100%. 100%.

542
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,520
Sandor, I want to thank you again

543
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,560
for this time

544
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,920
and for all the great insights.

545
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,640
Before we leave,

546
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:08,280
I have to put you on the spot

547
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,440
and ask you my favorite question,

548
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,160
which is three words that you would use

549
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,360
to describe yourself

550
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:17,160
or that your GSB classmates would use

551
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,240
to describe you or your partners.

552
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:23,600
Three words to describe,

553
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,000
well, it's a good life.

554
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:31,280
It's a good life. Now, it's four.

555
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,240
Enjoy. Learn.

556
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,830
Enoy. Learn. It's a good life.

557
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,760
Learn, make good friends at Stanford.

558
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:37,760
Start companies.

559
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,440
Take risks.

560
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,520
That was worth much more than three words.

561
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,080
Trust me.

562
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:46,880
Right. Thank you so much.

563
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,760
Sandor, thank you.

564
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,200

Say hi to your son for me.

00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,790
And stay safe and stay healthy.

00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,640
Will do. Thanks again. Take care.

568
00:22:54,650 --> 00:23:04,120
Bye bye.
