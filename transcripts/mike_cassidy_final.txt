1 You have to be fast at hiring people, you have to be fast in making decisions, you have to be fast in executing on your marketing in executing on your product releases. You have to match your actions with your strategy. Mike Cassidy, thank you for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? Good. How are you? It is such an honor and privilege to have you here. Thank you so much for joining me. I know how incredibly busy you are and I really appreciate it. I'm excited to talk to you these 20 minutes about really your journey and your outlook on startups, on deep technology, on making an impact. Mike, besides the fact that you are a VP at Google and ran Project Loon, which is one of my all time favorite tech projects I've ever seen with trying to provide Internet to billions of people through balloons. You were also serial entrepreneur with multiple startups behind you. I believe one of them started with a $500 that you and your co-founders put in. So, I'd love to hear that story. And today you're running Apollo Fusion, which I can't wait to hear about what it is. But, Mike, let's get started with real passion, which is the fact that you've released two jazz albums. How does that work with all with everything else that I was saying? So, I love a change of pace. And when I do startups between the startups, I try to do something fun. And for one year, between startups, I was an entrepreneur in residence at Benchmark. But a different year, I went to Berklee College of Music. And when I was there, I studied jazz piano and studied what it takes to record and produce records. And so, I had fun doing that. Wow. Unbelievable. What is it about jazz that excites you? And I have to ask this question because I've already met multiple really, really incredible people from the techs that are just really love jazz, my father being one of them. So, what is it about jazz that really excites you? I mean, the improvisation part is really fun, I think, so, it's not like the same tone all the time. When you get into the improve section, you're hearing something new every time. And the act of improvisation I think is, it's a great challenge. You've got the chords and then, real time, you're trying to make up a melody that fits with the chords and fits in with what the people around you are playing. It's also kind of a camaraderie to jazz playing in a combo that there is in a startup. You're listening to what every person in the combo is doing and you're playing off them and they're playing off you. And it's very fun for me. I love it. And I think one of the first things that I was always inspired about jazz is when I started playing saxophone very young was the idea that you have this both the harmony at one point where everybody's playing together. But then at some point, you're also giving the stage to individual people to showcase their creativity and you're supporting them and you're continuing to play but consciously supporting them so that they are the forefront and giving them that chance. I think that's just wonderful. Mike, take me back to the young days. Studying aerospace engineering at MIT, going then to Harvard, I believe. But what is the trajectory that you hope for yourself along the way? What do you imagine yourself doing later on in life? Well, in the beginning, I wanted to be an astronaut. But it doesn't really worked out. Yes. But for the next best thing was, I guess, being an aerospace engineer and I love being an aerospace engineer. And I started off at this place it was an aircraft company working on satellites and launch vehicles and a solar powered race car. But part of that process was me kind of feeling like through the aerospace industry, in those days at least, was very big and not the fastest moving and it didn't feel like you could have a huge impact personally on like starting up a startup that would then turn into a big company in the aerospace industry. So, I kind of wanted to do a startup in a different industry where a company could get a lot of traction and move a lot faster. I mean, you're talking about how speed and about the pace of the industry, which resonates interestingly. I'd love to talk soon about speed as the primary business strategy that you talked about. But take me to the days of Stylus. You're starting out with your co-founders, you're putting in $500 each, a company that takes off pretty quickly. What was that journey like? Give me a little bit of the back end story. Yeah. So, we're definitely capital constrained, that's for sure. We had $1500 plus we won the MIT Business Plan competition, which was a $10,000 price, so we had $11,500. And it really forced us to be, necessity is the mother of invention. I mean every step of the way we'd be super frugal, super careful. And as we launched this software product, we literally every day on the wall, we put how much profit did we make today. We didn't put what our sales, but how much profit we make. And we sort of trained our whole company, to focused on profit, and then we would make a little rules for ourselves, like, okay, before we can hire a tech support person, we need to have three weeks where the total profit each week is at least $10,000. And then once that happened, we now can hire tech support person. And I think that discipline helped the whole company focus on the right things. How do you focus on that discipline? Because it sounds to me from talking to a lot of young entrepreneurs and looking at myself, that's one of the hardest things to do. It's to have that bigger picture, that vision, overarching strategy of understanding what it will take to continue growing. Where do you get that discipline at such an early time? This is, I believe, one of the first endeavors that you run by yourself. Right? Well, I think it was kind of forced on us. I mean, we were like, had to focus on the fundamentals. You know, who is going to buy, we had this idea for a piece of software or software tool, who is going to buy it. We sort of figured we had some ideas on that. And then, what is our sort of marketing distribution channel. And it was very simple for us. There was a computer chart in a Journal of ONE magazine, it was focused on computer telephony and then there was something called Visual Basic Programmer's Journal, basically, a medium for people who are using visual basic. And our tool was a visual basic tool to do a computer telephony. So, we focused on those two channels and we focused on like PR, we got on the cover of computer telephony magazine twice over the course of about a year. We focused on basic advertising. We would take out a $1,000 ad in one of these magazines and we are going to see, okay, we got $3,000 back. Okay, maybe we can try $2,000 ad and we get 9,000 back and we just do the basics. And it really it was the basics. I love it. I love it. And the next endeavor, Direct Hit. 500 days, $500M acquisition and obviously it's not just about the money, but it's also the impact. But that makes me think a lot about your presentation, speed as the primary business strategy. You're coming from an industry where you're saying that, you know, it's not necessarily moving the fastest. You're an early young entrepreneur, out of MIT and Harvard, what is this thinking process behind speed as the primary business strategy? What does that even mean to you? Well, I think speed brings a lot of advantages. First of all, you can, it's easier to attract people to join your venture when you can point to have faster moving. Like one of the companies was, it was an instant messenger for PC video games. And if we could say, you know, in a month ago, we gained in the past month, you know, we gained two million new users. The month before that, we gained a million new users. That gets people to say, wow, I want to join your company. Or when you're raising money, you can show those statistics, it's easier to raise money. When you are getting press to cover you, it's easier to get the press to cover you. So, also, tougher for your competition to keep up with you. I mean we had competitors who were releasing, we are releasing a new version of the product basically every two weeks. Every two weeks, a new version would come out. And some of our competitors were releasing a new version of their product every year. So, it was much easier for us at a two week cycle to basically just destroy them from a feature comparison standpoint. What does that mean today? Yeah, go ahead. Well, so I think I mean, I think the speed, you know, brings a lot of advantages from a competitive standpoint. And then you just have to execute in that in everything you do. You have to be fast at hiring people. You have to be fast in making decisions. You have to be fast in executing on your marketing, executing on your product releases. You have to match your actions with your strategy. Right. So, you're really looking at speed as a strategy and not just as an advantage, but actually something that the leadership of a company should put forward as one of their key motivations in their day to day. Right? And because it all comes down to culture and how everybody is aligned towards what are the milestones. I'm seeing it now within a very fast growing company, Hippo, how we're all feeling the pace and everybody's aligned towards this amazing mission and we know that every day counts, which is really incredible. Mike, I have to talk about Project Loon because it's one of my favorite all time projects. I remember seeing the videos of the balloons and just thinking about how creative that is and the impact that it can do. You joined Google to help run it but tell me a little bit about the motivations behind Project Loon and really all about what it takes to run a moonshot idea like this. Yeah. So, Loon was a very very fun, crazy, challenging adventure. When we started on it, pretty much 95% of everyone heard of it, thought it was never going to work, and it was crazy. We had to do a lot of things. We have to basically shrink a cell tower to be much, much lighter, much smaller and much use much less power, because that's where basically putting on a balloon. We had to find ways of steering the balloons and people didn't think you could steer, really, you know, these balloons at 60,000 ft. You didn't have a motor on it to propel it around. But in the stratosphere, the wind direction is stratified. So, at 61,000 ft. the wind might be going five miles an hour east at 59,000 ft. It might be going 12 miles an hour south. So, by just going up and down you can steer in north, east, south and west. And those little key tactical, whatever design advantages eventually got us the point where we could launch, you know, a couple of dozen balloons from Puerto Rico and two weeks later having them hovering all over a spot of, a few dozen square miles in Peru. And so, it was just a series of solving technical challenges. I just love that and give me a little bit of background as to why Project Loon came about. So, obviously we're talking about accessibility, we're talking about a creative way to provide accessibility for places in the world. Can you give me a little bit of context as to how many people still are not don't have access to Internet? Why does Google X put so many resources into this crazy creative project? Yeah. So, you know, when we're starting something on the order of half of the people in the world didn't have Internet access. When you go to Africa, there's a billion people in Africa, only 100 million had Internet access. Even when we were starting even in India, over a billion people, only about a hundred million had Internet access. So, there were lots and lots of people who didn't have access. And some of it was very straightforward. In the more urban areas, there were cell towers and it was cost effective for the telephone companies to build cell towers. But a lot of times in the more rural areas, it was not cost effective and a lot of people in the rural areas just didn't have cell towers. So, that was kind of the thinking. And then, of course, all the things, all the benefits the Internet brings, you know, weather reports and education and medical information and commerce. So, that was kind of the driver behind the idea. That's incredible. And now, you're coming in to Project Loon, you've had, I believe, four startups behind you working in other companies previously, and now you're running a team that it's not really clear whether this is going to succeed. There is no crazy, there is no profit at the end of the day that you're marking on the border to know your growth. You're really solving a huge technical problem that at the end could potentially impact billions of people. What is the leadership mindset that you have to take into this that is perhaps either different or similar to your previous endeavors? Well, I mean, I still believe that, that moving very quickly was the right strategy for Loon. I mean, there's competition in the world. I mean, you can just look around today, you see multiple satellite constellations, you know, SpaceX's Starlink, you know, OneWeb, Tesla has announced one, Amazon has announced one. So yeah. They're trying to do some of the things, bring Internet to many people. So, you have got to move to beat the competition. But also, you've got to move quickly just to avoid the project kind of petering out. If it goes on too many years without success, you know, Google might decide they don't want to continue to fund it. People on the team might decide it's not interesting enough they might drift off the team. So, I think there's still advantages or necessity in many cases to move in quickly, even in a corporate environment like that. Right. And in 2017, you go back to to the entrepreneurial days, creating a new venture, Apollo Fusion, again in the aerospace field. Why leave VP at Google, a dream position that, you know, millions of people want? You've had these experiences before, right? You know what it's like being an entrepreneur. People say that you have to be crazy to be an entrepreneur. Why go and create a new venture? I mean, I just love the camaraderie of the startup environment. I love the, you know, the small team. We have 20 people now at Apollo Fusion. I just love that sort of size. And it's more what I'm used to. It's sort of a small, small team company. Yeah. It's been more and more what I'm used to. So, what's the mission, because also Apollo Fusion is trying to solve some pretty incredible problems that are extremely relevant to 2020, especially what we've seen with environmental changes? Yeah, it's very fun time to be in the space business. It's kind of like the second space boom, space renaissance or something like in the 60s, we're very excited with the Apollo program and a lot of attention focused on it. I think, over a few decades, the interest kind of died down a little bit. You know, the space shuttle program ended. Right. Got to be kind of bogged down but, some of the things you mentioned before, like with SpaceX being able to offer a much cheaper payload, dollars per kilogram to orbit with, you know, using various cell phone type technology to make small satellites. You talk about the inertial measurement unit inside a cell phone. You can use that on a satellite. You can use the CPU from a cell phone, you can use that on satellite. So, you can drive the cost of the satellites down, the launch costs is going down, and there's a lot of uses, right? There's the Internet bringing communication uses, but there's also Earth observation. A lot of people are interested in using the satellites to track where forests are getting burned or there's illegal fishing going on. You can detect climate change and or from a, you know, from a competitive standpoint, you can measure sort of what's going on in the competitive landscape and you can use that information to make your company faster and better. 100%. Mike, I have, you know, going over this incredible journey. Most of the people that are watching this are young entrepreneurs, young engineers that are excited to go on their journey. One of the things that I mention that I'm incredibly inspired by is solving really difficult problems that have a huge impact, potential huge impact later on. What are some insights that you've gained over the years that you would tell either yourself as a young entrepreneur or other young hungry entrepreneurs that are just thinking about how to get started? What are some really main things that you would keep in mind? Yeah. So, it was either Larry or Sergey who once pointed out to me that, all start ups are going to be very hard. So, if they're all going be hard, why don't you go after something big, anyway, which at first I was like, that's kind of crazy, but I think it's kind of true. Yeah. I think I'm really a big fan of focusing on the right general industry to be in. Like, in the 80s, you want to be in personal computers. You know, in the late 90s, you want to be an Internet type businesses. Right now, you might want to be in the space business or you might want to be in, you know, CRISPR or biotech or something like that. So, focus on the right space to be in. You know, whatever is a rising tide rises or ships or whatever. But then also, four out of the five companies I had had to change direction from the original idea. So, maybe I'm not so good at picking the first idea, but putting together a really, you know, A plus team that can pivot quickly and get in the right space, get started. I'm always encouraging entrepreneurs, get started, get a good team together, start out, put your whatever your prototype out there, and whatever you call it the initial product, whatever, put it out there and  get feedback, yeah. Get feedback and then adjust. And that happen four out of five times. We got feedback saying, that's the wrong direction. But, by the way, near what you're doing is something that's much more interesting. So, shift over to that near thing. So yeah, I definitely encourage entrepreneurs to do that. 100%. I love the mentality, I see quite a few people that are get so excited about this idea that they do get an A plus team, but then they run off for about a year, year and a half perfecting that idea, only to realize that there are some really dramatic pivots because they never had any initial validation. But by providing this, you know, 50% MVP to the world and prototyping just to see reactions and pivoting quickly, saves so much time and obviously capital. Mike, thank you so much for being here. This is so great to have you and thank you for being generous with your time. Before we leave, I have to ask the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. Okay, number one is tenacious. I think it was Thomas Edison, who said, if you are faced with failure again and again, what's the surest way to succeed is to always be willing to try just one more time. And it seems like a little whatever, a little simple thing. But if you think about it, it's kind of true, right? I mean, if you're always being willing to try it just one more time, then you'll never, by definition, fail. The second one, I guess, would be optimistic. I mean, I think other people have said this. I think it's a very characteristic trait of entrepreneurs that they're irrationally optimistic. I think I'm definitely irrational optimistic. But, you know, you kind of need that to be an entrepreneur. 100%. Yeah, that's good. And then the last one, I think maybe open. I'm very open at the company. I tell the team when things are going great and when they're not going great, but at least that way they believe me. I think it's a bad CEO trait to always be saying everything's great when no one believes you. So, you've got to be open and tell people what's going on. Mike, thank you very, very much. This was phenomenal. I can't wait to follow Apollo Fusion some more. And stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you for having me and say hi to your dad for me. Okay, bye bye.
