1
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,440
We got it right.

2
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,480
Wonderful.

3
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,920
Itamar Novick,  thank you so much

4
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,760
for being on the show.

5
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,960
I really appreciate your time.

6
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,520
Michael, thanks for having me.

7
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,280
I'm super excited to be here.

8
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,840
I am so excited to learn

9
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,920
over these next 20 minute

10
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,480
what it means to scale businesses,

11
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,160
to raise venture capital.

12
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,760
You've raised over $270 million yourself

13
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,240
of venture capital funds,

14
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,440
besides being an early stage investor

15
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,680
through Recursive Ventures

16
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,600
and being a venture partner

17
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,040
of UpWest and Jay Ventures.

18
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,320
And I if I begin to say everything

19
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,080
that you've done,

20
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,360
I'm not gonna end there.

21
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,720
Itamar, give me a brief rundown

22
00:03:56,722 --> 00:03:58,200
of who you are.

23
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,280
What are you passionate about?

24
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,760
And let's move from there.

25
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,640
Absolutely. Thanks for asking.

26
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,760
So, I'm an operating investor,

27
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,400
which means that I have a day job

28
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,040
during the day and that is the

29
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,080
Chief Business Officer at Life360.

30
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,920
A company I helped take public last year

31
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,440
in the Australian Stock Exchange

32
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,800
for a valuation of over 600 US million dollars.

33
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,520
And at night and on weekends,

34
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,320
I'm at Recursive Ventures,

35
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,160
which is a seed fund

36
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,320
that I've raised myself.

37
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,000
And I've been investing in startup companies

38
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,240
at the pre-seeds stage

39
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,320
of the last eight or nine years.

40
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,280
Incredible. Okay.

41
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,880
Hold on, what is chief business officer?

42
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,920
I know what a chief executive officer,

43
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,000
or chief financial officer.

44
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,600
What is the chief business officer?

45
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,520
So, I think it's a little bit

46
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,760
up for interpretation.

47
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,240
Different companies use that title

48
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,760
sparingly for different things,

49
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,640
specifically for Life360.

50
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,120
Being a consumer business,

51
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,480
being a seed business,

52
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,280
I'm really the person that manages most

53
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,840
of the business development opportunities

54
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,360
with different partners.

55
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,440
Creating an ecosystem of partners

56
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,200
and other parties

57
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,440
that want to engage with us.

58
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,400
And also, doing what's called

59
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,560
corporate development,

60
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,120
which is mostly M&A.

61
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,720
And that's us acquiring

62
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,920
potentially smaller companies

63
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,600
and expand our product line

64
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
or help with our talents in the company.

65
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,960
Incredible. So, you're moonlighting as

66
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,880
the precedent seed investor,

67
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,200
yet you're running,

68
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,560
you're helping formulate

69
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,520
business propositions and M&As

70
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,920
for companies that go public like Life360.

71
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,600
Is there a dissonance between the two?

72
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,480
Is there what? Sorry.

73
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,280
A dissonance. A clear distinction.

74
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,280
Because it sounds like two different worlds.

75
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,440
Yeah, it's true.

76
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,040
Actually, I do a little context switching.

77
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,840
But, really the underlying thread

78
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,160
that connects it all is

79
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,320
I just love helping entrepreneurs, right?

80
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,960
So, I found early on in my career

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,120
that I'm okay as a CEO.

82
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,360
I can run the company,

83
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,840
but I'm actually better at supporting CEOs.

84
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,600
Supporting entrepreneurs running companies.

85
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,840
So, really, when it comes to

86
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,000
when you think about value creation

87
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,160
and entrepreneurship and VC,

88
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,920
back scalable startups,

89
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,800
often at some point you'd either

90
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,480
think about fund raising, right?

91
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,760
To basically accelerate

92
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,320
scaling up the business.

93
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,840
Or you'd think about potentially

94
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,000
acquiring other companies

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
that can help you do that even faster

96
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,840
just getting the business.

97
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,320
Or you'd think about going public

98
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,160
or selling your company.

99
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,600
And those are places where I think

100
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,400
if you got a lot of collective experience

101
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,440
across different pieces

102
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,680
that add up to the startup ecosystem.

103
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,840
Whether it's product marketing,

104
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,280
technology and of course,

105
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,880
adding finance on top of that.

106
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,320
You can really add a lot of value

107
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:34,920
when you've got this

108
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,760
positive view of of things.

109
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,080
And that's really what I bring to the table.

110
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,080
Because of my background

111
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,160
being engineering product,

112
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,280
hands-on operations,

113
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,160
business development,

114
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,120
and also funding and finance.

115
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,880
Okay. So, if you had to guess,

116
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,520
how many entrepreneurs have you helped

117
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,280
over the years?

118
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,600
Honestly, probably hundreds.

119
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,480
By the way, I have a rule

120
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
which I'd like to share with you

121
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,920
and the audience.

122
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,240
Whenever I engage with entrepreneurs,

123
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,560
I just have so much sympathy

124
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,600
for what they're going through.

125
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,200
Because I've done it myself.

126
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,920
And I just try to find a way to help.

127
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,240
Even if it's one small thing

128
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,360
I make promise

129
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,560
to the public that I talk with.

130
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,880
If you're spending your time with me,

131
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,720
you're very valuable.

132
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,640
That I find at least one way to help you

133
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,560
and hopefully more.

134
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,200
But, you can't be with every entrepreneur.

135
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,080
I mean, your time is incredibly valuable,

136
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,200
incredibly scarce.

137
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,440
So, how do you choose

138
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,400
who do you work with and

139
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,960
who do you not work with?

140
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,800
That's a great question.

141
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,200
So, unfortunately, like other VCs,

142
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,160
I do have to filter out so I can focus

143
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,320
on what I think are opportunities

144
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,040
that have the highest propensity

145
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,080
or biggest chances to make an impact

146
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
on me as an investor.

147
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,400
And of course, on the founders

148
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,960
and on society, right?

149
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,880
So, I've got to pick and choose

150
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,640
which battles I want to fight.

151
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,280
And I do that using the skills

152
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,360
that I've learned as an institutional VC

153
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,480
from some of the best in the business

154
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,640
when they're working more in their ventures.

155
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
I learn how they evaluate opportunities

156
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,000
and I try to focus my time

157
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,560
on what I believe is the best way.

158
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,040
With that said, I think in this business,

159
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,920
in venture capital, you really have to

160
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,400
create value for people around you

161
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,320
in your network.

162
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,120
You've got to make an impact also

163
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,160
for your companies.

164
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,120
So, I try to do the best that I can

165
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,280
and free up as much time as I can.

166
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,480
Match to free up,

167
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,520
to really help people in my network.

168
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,160
Of course. Okay.

169
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,360
So, hundreds of entrepreneurs

170
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,280
that you've helped.

171
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,160
Are there more similarities

172
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,160
or differences that you've seen?

173
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,320
Because then obviously everybody's crazy.

174
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,760
That's like the number one similarity.

175
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,320
But more tangibly, are there more

176
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,760
differences or similarities?

177
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,800
It's funny that you say most

178
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,960
entrepreneurs are crazy.

179
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,920
I actually think the best entrepreneurs

180
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,640
are amazing in mitigating risk.

181
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,320
Because startups are so risky

182
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,040
to begin with.

183
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,160
That really a lot of good founders,

184
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,400
what they know how to do well, is like,

185
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,840
Okay, we've got those 10 different

186
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,120
risk vectors in our business.

187
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,480
How do we reduce it down to one? Right?

188
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,040
Because startups are so risky.

189
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,600
So, I think I've seen a lot of

190
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,520
different entrepreneurs

191
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,240
and they also invest in entrepreneurs

192
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,720
out here in the Bay Area.

193
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,000
And entrepreneurs across the US

194
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,600
with some focus on Israeli entrepreneurs.

195
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,080
Probably 30, 35%.

196
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,400
My portfolio is what I call

197
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,640
Israeli companies

198
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,040
which typically means that

199
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,400
they've been started by an

200
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,640
Israeli entrepreneur here in the U.S..

201
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,760
Is there a specific reason

202
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,800
for that by the way?

203
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,880
Why that focus?

204
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,480
Well, first of all, I'm Israeli.

205
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,600
And I moved to the states

206
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,080
a little bit over 10 years ago.

207
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,600
So, naturally, culturally, it's easier

208
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,160
for me to relate to Israelis, right?

209
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,520
And also because I believe

210
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,840
in the Israeli startup ecosystem.

211
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,160
I think we're just getting started, right?

212
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,080
With Israelis back in Israel

213
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,200
doing amazing work across different fields,

214
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,040
machine learning, cybersecurity,

215
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,800
so on and so forth.

216
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,280
There's so much more opportunities

217
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,440
back in our holy land.

218
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,280
That's one.

219
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,120
And second thing, I've seen

220
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,840
and I've worked with so many

221
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,320
successful, resourceful, creative,

222
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,080
amazing entrepreneurs.

223
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,280
Israelis moved here in the US.

224
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,080
So, I think it's actually an advantage

225
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,920
that I'm pretty easily able to tap

226
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,400
into Israeli entrepreneurs

227
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,520
and help them scale their companies.

228
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,400
Incredible. And I mean, you are very active

229
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,360
with both UpWest Labs and J-Ventures.

230
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,600
And I'm probably missing a bunch others

231
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,400
that are very involved with the Israeli

232
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,520
or Jewish ecosystem.

233
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,640
So, that definitely shows.

234
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,840
Scaling a startup.

235
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,480
You mentioned that a lot of entrepreneurs

236
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,400
are saying that they're able to mitigate

237
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,520
the risk or the various risks that they have.

238
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,640
But at the end of the day,

239
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,200
like 99.99% of startups fail.

240
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,280
So, what do you see that you're seeing

241
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,520
a lot of early stage entrepreneurs coming in

242
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,640
before even a pre-seed or a seed?

243
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,160
I mean, most of them are gonna fail.

244
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,920
What is the distinction that you see?

245
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,400
What are the common themes of those

246
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,320
that end up able to raise that capital

247
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,360
that gets them to where they need

248
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,120
to get to or don't?

249
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,160
That's a great question.

250
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,680
So, there's no science here, right?

251
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,840
There is directional thinking on what

252
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,920
me personally and other folks

253
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,480
in the industry believe that works.

254
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,640
So, I think in the early stages,

255
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,680
there's three things that I really

256
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,600
wanna focus on,

257
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,760
which is the quality of the team

258
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,040
and how fit is that team to solve

259
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,960
this specific problem.

260
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,480
TAM, total addressable market.

261
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,960
Which is a huge deal for VCs.

262
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,080
And it should be a huge deal

263
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,000
for entrepreneurs as well,

264
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,600
because you don't wanna go after

265
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,680
a small opportunity

266
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,560
that's not necessarily VC scalable

267
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,280
and trying to win that way

268
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,360
with all you can.

269
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,360
So TAM is I think a really important one

270
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,960
that entrepreneurs sometimes miss

271
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,880
and should pay more attention to.

272
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,960
And the last I would say,

273
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,680
which is not always easy for investors

274
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,000
to speak up and talk about that

275
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,200
is why they call Fundability.

276
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,880
So, you know how you sometimes

277
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,640
it's really hard to turn down

278
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,880
source reactions.

279
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,640
There's something there, right?

280
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,160
If you wanna succeed in the

281
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,840
VC start up game,

282
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
you've gotta be fundable.

283
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,880
And on top of all the other things

284
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,560
that I think about

285
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,840
when I think about investing

286
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,560
in pre-seen and seed companies,

287
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,880
I really do have to take into account

288
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,040
whether this people, this company,

289
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,640
this story would be able to scale

290
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,600
to more and more investors

291
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,560
that would put bigger checks

292
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,880
into the company's scale.

293
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,120
So, what you're saying is that

294
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,720
as an early stage investor,

295
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,880
you're looking at a company

296
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,280
that you're not just saying,

297
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,560
is this company able to use my money

298
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,160
wisely to get to a product or

299
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,320
to get to their first customers?

300
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,640
But are they able to then use

301
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,440
that momentum and raise

302
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,640
their series A, their series B

303
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,440
from institutional investors?

304
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,720
And which is one of the biggest tests, right,

305
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,640
for startups.

306
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,840
Are they're able to get past that big

307
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,480
first institutional funding

308
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,800
and propel that growth?

309
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,080
And I think having that funding

310
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,240
and having better and smarter people

311
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,440
are on the table to help you

312
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,520
as an entrepreneur.

313
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,760
Scale your startup is extremely important.

314
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,720
Which is why, also for me, as a VC,

315
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,680
I believe that's where VCs

316
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,200
can add most value.

317
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,080
Make sure that your companies

318
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,120
are well funded.

319
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,080
That's probably the single thing

320
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,000
that VCs can do to help

321
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,400
their entrepreneurs most.

322
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,680
Of course, there's many other things.

323
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,000
But that would be the first.

324
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,360
Yeah, I just had a fascinating

325
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,280
conversation with also somebody

326
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,280
from J-Ventures who's really well known

327
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,080
for crisis management and coming into

328
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,760
companies who need help

329
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,960
when they're not able to necessarily

330
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,600
raise another round and maximize

331
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,520
the value of their assets.

332
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,920
And one of the things that he mentioned

333
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,920
is that the real value

334
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,400
that the board members and the VCs

335
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,760
can provide is grounding the founders

336
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,240
and making sure that they understand

337
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,840
in the high level of what they need to do,

338
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,440
what how much funding they need,

339
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,560
how do they raise that funding

340
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,800
and make sure that their product,

341
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,400
that their company lives on.

342
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,440
What's happening today

343
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,160
in terms of raising money?

344
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,400
Because as a young entrepreneur,

345
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,720
it's very confusing.

346
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,720
A lot of people are saying,

347
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,920
only raise how much you really need.

348
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,120
Save the equity.

349
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,240
Focus on the business.

350
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,280
Don't focus on your ego.

351
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,200
A lot of others are saying,

352
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,280
raise as much as you can

353
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,480
because we don't know

354
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,680
what's happening tomorrow.

355
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,520
There might to be such a thing as covid-19

356
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,560
and you're not gonna be able to raise

357
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,640
that funding from March until May.

358
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,760
So, where are you on the spectrum of thought?

359
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,400
I'm very entrepreneurial friendly.

360
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,000
So, I'd probably say,

361
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,680
raise as much as you can,

362
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,520
but not too much.

363
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,840
Okay. So, explain that.

364
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,080
I think having more capital to work with

365
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,160
and basically enabling you

366
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,880
to have more room for mistakes.

367
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,280
And a lot of startups, I mean,

368
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,560
startups are really this journey

369
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,880
inside the founder

370
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,360
and the founding teams have.

371
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,720
Like, how quickly do you understand

372
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,520
how to position

373
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,020
your market, your product.

374
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,760
How to brand and sell

375
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,520
and operate and scale your business.

376
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,560
And it's really that journey

377
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,800
where you have to learn all those things

378
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,320
is the more that you do it,

379
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,720
the more value create,

380
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,640
the faster you create that value.

381
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,080
So, having more capital enables you

382
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,320
to potentially accelerate that journey.

383
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,480
And that's, of course,

384
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,880
is extremely important.

385
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,840
But on the other hand,

386
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,360
having too much capital

387
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,680
and we've seen some of this with some

388
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,720
of the Softbank vision funds,

389
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,640
where we've seen the situations of

390
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,240
over capitalization that basically

391
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,720
leads to mistakes, right?

392
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,560
Because it's easy

393
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,440
to solve problems with money.

394
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,200
But often that is not the right solution

395
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,960
for problems.

396
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,240
Often maybe you have

397
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,200
the wrong team members.

398
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,760
Or you've got the wrong business model.

399
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,200
Or maybe you've got

400
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,920
the wrong go-to market, right?

401
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,680
And pouring more money

402
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,960
on that problem actually doesn't fix it

403
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,240
and masks the real underlying issue.

404
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,280
So, raise as much money as you can

405
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,480
to give you as many bullets in that gun

406
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,440
to shoot and aim and try to hit your target.

407
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,840
But not too much that

408
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,120
you can become undisciplined.

409
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,680
I think that's fascinating.

410
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,680
This idea that money

411
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,120
can solve a lot of problems,

412
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,160
especially early on.

413
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,400
And it's almost blind the organization

414
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,560
into thinking into masking some of the real

415
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,560
underlying problems, because at the end,

416
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,400
you wanna be lean,

417
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,480
you wanna be efficient,

418
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,240
you wanna maximize your product

419
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,600
and not just use money to,

420
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,520
let's say I wanna get to

421
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,920
a million views on this show.

422
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,040
I can pay a million dollars

423
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,920
for advertising to get a million viewers.

424
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,880
But it doesn't necessarily mean

425
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,440
that my product is good or

426
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,040
that I'm doing something useful.

427
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,120
That's not a business.

428
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,120
You actually lost money.

429
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
That's not good business.

430
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,920
That's definitely not good business.

431
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,840
But if I'm able to do this with a $100

432
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,720
then we know that there's something here

433
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,840
that with a million dollars,

434
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,880
I can actually scale this

435
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,960
in a very healthy way.

436
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,000
Right. When you think about it,

437
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,320
a lot of VCs these days

438
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,800
they're really focused on scaling up.

439
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,160
It means that there is already

440
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,240
some level of product market

441
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,320
and maybe it's really good.

442
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,680
And right you need the majority

443
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,600
of capital is when

444
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,560
you're really scaling up.

445
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,840
Going from five salespeople

446
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,160
to 50 salespeople.

447
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,120
That requires investment ahead of time.

448
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
If you really hire those people.

449
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
Train them, make them effective, right?

450
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,680
If you're early on the first innings

451
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,680
of coming up with your company.

452
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,040
Whether it's a B2C or a B2B company,

453
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,680
I'd actually say it's not about the money.

454
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,560
It's about really coming up

455
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,680
with your thesis,

456
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,840
having an MVP,

457
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,510
getting out there testing stuff.

458
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,200
You don't need 100 people

459
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,360
and tens of thousands of dollars

460
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,240
to be able to do that.

461
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,240
To get that motivation.

462
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,840
Sure. So, I mean, you've seen

463
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,400
quite a few entrepreneurs go in

464
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,760
and scale their product

465
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,560
or scale their business

466
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,240
from five salespeople to 50 salespeople.

467
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,040
Well, what are the factors that are gonna

468
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,320
make or break you?

469
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,280
Or what do I need

470
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,590
to keep in mind later on?

471
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,800
This is a very selfish advice

472
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,000
that I'm asking for now.

473
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,080
What do I need to keep in mind

474
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,110
as young entrepreneur as

475
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,480
I will attempt to scale my business

476
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,440
from five customers to 50 customers?

477
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,680
That's a very interesting question.

478
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,830
So, I've got a little bit of a theory

479
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,840
that I've developed over the years,

480
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,070
and that is what got you here

481
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,000
is not necessarily

482
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,040
what's gonna get you there.

483
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,310
And more specifically, with startups,

484
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,560
what happens is that the culture

485
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,720
shifts a lot in the early stages, right?

486
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:54,720
So, early on it's like two gals and a dog.

487
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,240
Right? Sitting in some basement maybe.

488
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,160
And they're trying to come up

489
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,640
with something and come up

490
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,830
with a business plan.

491
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,160
And that scales all the way to

492
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,000
five, 10, 20 people.

493
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,040
But, once you get to forward is like,

494
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,360
managers and people reporting to them,

495
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,280
let's say a 20 to 30 people range,

496
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,720
something breaks,

497
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,680
something changes with the culture.

498
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,680
The lines of communication become longer

499
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,360
and more complicated in seeking

500
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,800
and getting alignment within the team

501
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,030
takes more energy.

502
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,960
And that's fine.

503
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,480
So, that's that breaking point.

504
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,720
There's another breaking point,

505
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,160
somewhere between those

506
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,240
50 to 80 employee range where, again,

507
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,560
you've got even longer lines

508
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,440
of communication.

509
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,720
Things are more complicated.

510
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,080
Some you have 20 people meetings

511
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,360
where everybody else is not there

512
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,830
has to say, "Yeah, this is awesome."

513
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,590
And then you can get going.

514
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,960
So, that's another breaking point.

515
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,000
And there's typically another one

516
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,280
of the 120 to 150 employee range.

517
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,440
And then you're like a big company.

518
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,070
You've got other company problems.

519
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,120
So, one of the things

520
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,400
that entrepreneurs and even investors

521
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,920
sometimes fail to recognize is that

522
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,880
the same set of people

523
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,200
that they've actually gotten from,

524
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:58,590
like 10 employees, zero employees to 20.

525
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,720
I think these are gonna be the people

526
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,440
that get you from 20 to 60.

527
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,720
It requires a different

528
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,270
type of leadership.

529
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,840
And you have to, first of all,

530
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,000
on yourself as an entrepreneur

531
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,200
and on your team and who's really

532
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,920
the best person for the job

533
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,080
at those different stages.

534
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,560
And that's something that's not always

535
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,160
easy for entrepreneurs to do

536
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,640
as the business scales up.

537
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,960
I mean, I've heard of this quite a few times.

538
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,560
There are there are some points

539
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,640
and I believe me,

540
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,350
Micha Kaufman from Fiverr,

541
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,520
he gave an inspiring talk on one

542
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,640
of the conferences I attended.

543
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,080
And he mentioned that

544
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,920
at every junction of Fiverr,

545
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,750
he kept asking himself,

546
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,320
"Am I still the right CEO

547
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,590
to grow this company?"

548
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,360
Now that we're hundreds of thousands

549
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,310
of employees.

550
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,840
This is a different company than

551
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,440
when we were a couple of friends

552
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,400
in a garage and just starting out.

553
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,440
And it sounds like it's almost

554
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,830
an impossible ask to go to an entrepreneur

555
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,760
or a founder and say,

556
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,510
"Hey, can you please ask yourself,

557
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,080
are you still the right CEO to run this?"

558
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,680
"And if not, can you please be honest

559
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,200
and go to the side

560
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,480
and let somebody else lead us?"

561
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,480
And Micha is amazing.

562
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,070
I love Micha.

563
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,960
He's one of those people that,

564
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,160
it's like it's the investors dream

565
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,160
of somebody who can start

566
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,510
by himself and then manage

567
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,550
a thousand people after an IPO, right?

568
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,510
There's people like that,

569
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,270
but it's not everybody.

570
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,680
And you have to really reflect

571
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,480
on yourself and understand.

572
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,920
I mean, even for me, it was a journey.

573
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,200
When I was younger, I was like,

574
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,880
"Yeah, I'll be CEO

575
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,400
and I'll be the best CEO ever."

576
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,750
And you know? That's not actually true.

577
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,400
Over time, you learn what you're good at.

578
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,560
And I'm really good at supporting

579
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,640
entrepreneurs first than being

580
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,750
an entrepreneur myself.

581
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,680
So, I think that kind of self reflection

582
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,830
can really go a long way for entrepreneurs.

583
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,360
Incredible. Itamar, what are you

584
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,030
passionate about?

585
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,440
What industries?

586
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,480
What type of entrepreneur?

587
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,120
What's it really gets you out of bed

588
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,350
in the morning?

589
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,350
So, I'm actually more of a generalist.

590
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,440
To be honest with you, I do have specific

591
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,750
areas and things that I focus on.

592
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,070
I invest in consumer technologies.

593
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,510
but not like e-commerce and media,

594
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,440
more services on the consumer side.

595
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,400
I invest in data and machine learning

596
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,440
tools and capabilities all the way across

597
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,320
the stack from infrastructure, deploying,

598
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,550
developing different types of data

599
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,640
and machine learning services

600
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,160
to actually service in financial services

601
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,800
and real estate and other verticals

602
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,960
where you can use data to disrupt

603
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,790
antiquated businesses.

604
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,800
And then I also do a little bit of

605
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,200
emerging tech, right?

606
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,160
Where I've tap them in stuff like mobility,

607
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:27,720
for example, IOT and other areas.

608
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,040
And it's interesting because when I look

609
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,720
at my track record of success rate,

610
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,000
my biggest wins as an investor,

611
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:38,030
Life360 IPO, credible IPO,

612
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,720
RING sold to Amazon

613
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,790
for over a billion dollars, right?

614
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,960
Automatic sold to SiriusXM.

615
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,680
When I think about

616
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,590
some of those opportunities,

617
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,270
They weren't thesis driven.

618
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,640
I recognize a strong entrepreneur

619
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,720
pursuing a great opportunity

620
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,920
and learn and adopted in the process of

621
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,040
engaging with them and build my thesis

622
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,520
on the go when I did that.

623
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,310
That's worked really well for me.

624
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,640
Right. That's inspiring.

625
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,240
Itamar, one thing I have to ask.

626
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,400
Entrepreneurship, a lot of times as a founder,

627
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,920
it seems you get a lot of nose.

628
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,720
You get a lot of suspicion.

629
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,000
You get a lot of rejections, right?

630
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,840
For every 99 VCs that say, "No."

631
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,000
Or, for every one VCs that says, "Yes."

632
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,240
You might get 99 that's say, "No."

633
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,120
How can founders get to be really open

634
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,920
to really important advice,

635
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,040
or be mindful of this advice

636
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,280
when they're constantly

637
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,440
hearing rejections and No's.

638
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,440
How can entrepreneurs filter out

639
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,550
the good and the bad

640
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,000
and really take in the important stuff?

641
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,310
Yeah, I think that's a great question.

642
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,880
And when I think about CEOs

643
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
and start companies,

644
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:45,840
tech startup companies,

645
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,920
they have two jobs that matter most to me:

646
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,800
one is fund raising

647
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,960
and the other one is creating a vision

648
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,680
for the company that aligns everybody,

649
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,590
every stakeholder in the company.

650
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,960
Those are the two most important things.

651
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,520
And I think if you're not really,

652
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:03,160
if you're not the right person to raise

653
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,790
capital from investors,

654
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,550
then I think in the early stages

655
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,350
you probably shouldn't be the CEO, right?

656
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,080
Because that's something

657
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,600
that the CEO is expected to do.

658
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,160
Like your team is coming in.

659
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,830
So, it's a little bit saliency,

660
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,680
to be honest with you.

661
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,800
Like, you have to reach out to all people.

662
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,760
It's a process like a sales process, right?

663
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,070
It's a partnership custom.

664
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,280
You're looking for a funding partner

665
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,120
for you on this journey.

666
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,600
And getting no's is really important.

667
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,800
And learning from those no's actually

668
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,400
getting valuable feedback,

669
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,400
finding ways to get valuable feedback,

670
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,200
finding ways to keep engaging

671
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,520
with someone, with investors.

672
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,960
Who knows, maybe it hasn't worked

673
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,680
this time around,

674
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,590
but it will work next time around, right?

675
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,440
That could be great.

676
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,920
And elegantly being able to

677
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,240
build your investors network,

678
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,240
even through those no's is actually

679
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,320
pretty critical for a startup CEO.

680
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,600
One way that I always chat about

681
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,640
with my entrepreneurs is,

682
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,880
often VCs would give you very vague

683
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,440
answers and why they chose

684
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,040
not to invest in your company.

685
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,600
And I think your goal as an entrepreneur

686
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,360
is to try to get to the bottom

687
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,040
of what's happening,

688
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,280
even if it's not something that's

689
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,200
comfortable for you to hear, right?

690
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,520
One of the best ways of doing that

691
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,360
is really [--]

692
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,040
and starting back to those VCs

693
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,640
to the people that introduced you to them

694
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,520
and trying to understand if you can

695
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,480
get some more information there.

696
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,320
Another good way

697
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,590
that I sometimes recommend is,

698
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,160
it's actually pretty good

699
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,480
if you've got two founders

700
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,540
in the meeting with VCs

701
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,480
where one, the CEO is just talking

702
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,070
because they're the ones that really meeting.

703
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,840
But another one

704
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,440
could be in the background.

705
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,240
So, the more taking notes

706
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,070
and just looking at people's reaction.

707
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,560
I love that.

708
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,310
Like,  what resonates?

709
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,240
What doesn't resonate?

710
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,320
It's really a different mindset

711
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,160
because you're not pitching.

712
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,520
You're there to really read

713
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,920
the reactions in the room.

714
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,720
And I've seen that being

715
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,550
successful as well.

716
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,400
I love that so much.

717
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,320
Itamar, right before we leave,

718
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,920
I can't believe 20 minutes are almost over.

719
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,070
This always go by way too fast.

720
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,720
I need three words that

721
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,360
you would use to describe yourself.

722
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,520
Can I use three words in one emotion?

723
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,160
100%

724
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:08,280
Okay. So, I Helping Entrepreneurs.

725
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,080
I love it. I love it.

726
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,400
And when you send me that emoji

727
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,480
through the e-mail,

728
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,680
it even looked better,

729
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,520
but it was much cuter

730
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,480
when you did it in person.

731
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,960
So, thank you.

732
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,760
Love helping entrepreneurs.

733
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,280
I look forward to reaching out

734
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,480
as an entrepreneur myself

735
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,440
to get some really important advice

736
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,440
and sending you my slidecks.

737
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,240
So, I just love that we're

738
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,280
forming this relationship.

739
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,000
And thank you for all the inspiring work

740
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,080
that you're teaching me

741
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,590
through a J-Ventures.

742
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,040
And thank you for being so generous

743
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,590
with your time here.

744
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,360
Absolutely. Thanks for doing this

745
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,110
