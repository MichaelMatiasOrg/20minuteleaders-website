1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,920
You need to know if

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,400
something can be built.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,160
You don't have to know

4
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,280
how to build it yourself,

5
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,720
you just have to know

6
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,680
that it can be done,

7
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,120
and that if you can get

8
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,080
the money from Silicon Valley

9
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,280
or something, you can hire the engineers

10
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,080
to build it for you.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,400
Wesley Boudville, thank you so much

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,000
for joining me on 20 Minutes Leaders.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,040
Welcome to my show.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,120
How are you?

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,240
Hello, fine.

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,760
I'm calling from Los Angeles

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,320
and the weather is cloudy.

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,000
Wonderful.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,200
Well, I'm calling from Tel Aviv.

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,960
It's been cloudy all week.

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,560
But Wes, the reason why

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,960
I'm so excited to chat with you

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,480
besides, your energy and enthusiasm,

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,400
is I get to talk

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,640
to an inventor in front of me.

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,600
And I love talking to inventors

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,360
because I consider myself an inventor

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,680
in many capacities.

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,240
But the way that you've done it

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,520
over the past years

31
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,560
and holding patents

32
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,280
and creating these

33
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,760
innovative technologies

34
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,160
based on a real problems,

35
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,120
I think it's fascinating.

36
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,160
So, Wes, give me

37
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,920
a little bit of background

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,280
as to who you are

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,960
and why do you consider yourself

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,640
an inventor?

41
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:28,840
Oh, I came to America

42
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,040
in 1983, to Los Angeles,

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,440
to get my PhD in theoretical physics.

44
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,040
And from Caltech in LA,

45
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,080
and I did that and then I stayed

46
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,920
in Los Angeles ever since.

47
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,320
And so, I've lived here

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,360
much longer than I have

49
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,200
in Australia where I'm from.

50
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,520
And I'm a first generation Australian.

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,120
I was born in Malaysia.

52
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,240
I'm Chinese mostly,

53
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,600
and I have a French surname.

54
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,960
It's one of these accidents of history.

55
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,000
But, you know, in Stanford,

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
you guys are used to that, too.

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,800
You get people from everywhere.

58
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,840
100%.

59
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,360
So Wes, how do you stumble upon

60
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,320
this idea of innovation and invention?

61
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,880
What does that even mean to you?

62
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,640
Because I've stumbled,

63
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,040
I think, that's the right way to put it.

64
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,560
I'm trained as a physicist.

65
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,480
I got two degrees of physics, and then

66
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,320
I made my living, after I got my PhD,

67
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,200
as a computer programmer.

68
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,320
Because this was 1989.

69
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,720
And the web was born that year.

70
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,040
And there were plenty of jobs

71
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,240
for programmers.

72
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,920
But in during the dot-com years,

73
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,280
I joined a dot-com startup

74
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,520
and it fell like most of them did.

75
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,040
But then I got hit with a startup bug.

76
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,400
And I've been

77
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,320
in the startup scene ever since.

78
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,240
And in 2008,

79
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,840
I stopped programming.

80
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:39,120
I programmed computers

81
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,600
from 1979 to 2008, 40 years.

82
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,800
I started in Fortran, I ended at Java.

83
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,280
But then I just, I went to actually

84
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,200
filing patent applications for myself.

85
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,840
And it was by now

86
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,560
I have 20 US patents

87
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,520
under my own name.

88
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,080
I'm single author on 19 of them.

89
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,760
And it's all engineering.

90
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,280
So, I started as a physicist,

91
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,680
but now I'm an engineer,

92
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,200
but I feel like I want to do this

93
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,160
for the rest of my life.

94
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,640
I'm very lucky.

95
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,560
Because for this,

96
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,480
yeah, a lot of people

97
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,320
are not in their jobs.

98
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
And I really am,

99
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,560
I feel like I'm in grad school

100
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,480
back at Caltech 30 years ago

101
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,040
because I'm doing research.

102
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
And I'm doing it for myself.

103
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,400
Wes, that's one

104
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
of the most inspiring things

105
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
I've heard in more than 300 episodes.

106
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,280
Tell me a little bit about

107
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,400
these inventions,

108
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,520
these patents that you've created.

109
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,280
What are some of them like?

110
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,360
I have my 20 patents in two groups.

111
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,160
The first group of seven patents,

112
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,400
it's on barcodes like QR codes,

113
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,120
two dimensional barcodes.

114
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,440
And my patents for that

115
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,000
are to control a screen,

116
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,040
electronic screen,

117
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,560
a flat screen that's near you,

118
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,920
a big flat screen that shows an image

119
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,040
and the image shows a barcode.

120
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,000
And so, you take out your cell phone

121
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,160
and you take a photo of the barcode

122
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,520
and you get on your cell phone

123
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,640
a web page.

124
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,200
And that webpage has buttons

125
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
you can click, things you can do,

126
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,640
and you can control

127
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,880
the big screen in front of you,

128
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,600
the big flat screen.

129
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,640
And okay, now that's the abstract,

130
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,880
the practical case is

131
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,880
if you are pedestrian on the street

132
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,720
and you're looking at a shop window.

133
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,125
Inside the shop window behind the glass

134
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,000
is a big flat screen showing

135
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,480
something for sale with a barcode.

136
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,440
When you scan the barcode,

137
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,760
you get a search box on your phone,

138
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
a webpage.

139
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,280
The search box,

140
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,400
pretend it's Google or something

141
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,760
and you type addresses,

142
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,640
and but when you hit return,

143
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,240
the results are not shown on your phone,

144
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,320
they're shown on the big flat screen

145
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,960
behind the glass.

146
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,480
And so, if it's a dress

147
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,840
or a hat or shirt,

148
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,600
you can see it life size

149
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,440
and you can search

150
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,600
the shop's entire inventory.

151
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,000
That's important because

152
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,920
it solves the problem

153
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,040
that stood for 100 years.

154
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,240
And ever since shop windows

155
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,160
were invented.

156
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,120
The shop window is too small

157
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,480
to show all the goods.

158
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,920
So, every few months

159
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,480
a shop manager has to

160
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,840
refresh the window physically.

161
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,160
She puts in new things.

162
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,880
Well now, she can still do that,

163
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,560
but now you can,

164
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,080
you search whatever you want

165
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,320
and then it'll display in big size.

166
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,480
That makes a lot of sense.

167
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,720
Wes, how do you stumble upon

168
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,520
that invention?

169
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,160
So, I want to take this

170
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,320
and explore this a little bit

171
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,240
more broadly about

172
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,000
what it means to be an inventor.

173
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,480
And so, what I would love

174
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,080
to hear from you

175
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,960
is sort of with these inventions,

176
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,040
how did you even think of them?

177
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,560
Because I'm guessing that

178
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,240
you're not too much

179
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,880
into retail and fashion,

180
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,760
you're not an expert

181
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,960
in retail or fashion,

182
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,880
so, how do you go ahead

183
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,480
and create a patent based on

184
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,680
retail and fashion?

185
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,640
That's right.

186
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,600
That's the hardest.

187
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,880
and it's still the most mysterious thing

188
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,000
for anybody,

189
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,880
unless you are Thomas Edison.

190
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,800
He had a thousand patents.

191
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,080
But the hardest thing is that

192
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,440
at the core of the innovative process.

193
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:52,640
And the good thing,

194
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,040
one of the thing is that

195
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,040
you need a good and technical education.

196
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,000
You don't have to be an engineer

197
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,760
or a scientist, but it helps.

198
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,880
But you need to know

199
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,480
if something can be built.

200
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,240
You don't have to know

201
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,360
how to build it yourself.

202
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,800
You just have to know

203
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,760
that it can be done

204
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,920
and then if you can get the money

205
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,720
from Silicon Valley or something,

206
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,360
you get to hire the engineers

207
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,160
to build it for you.

208
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,120
So, I guess for me

209
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,280
with a barcode thing,

210
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,320
I imagined it

211
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,160
and I got the patents on it.

212
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,640
But I just,

213
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,480
like a remote control of a screen

214
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,360
that's what I was thinking of

215
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,880
without being able to touch it.

216
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,600
What I'm doing right now,

217
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,000
my main focus on my most,

218
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,320
of my 13 other patents

219
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,120
are an alternative to domains

220
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,040
or domain name system.

221
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,320
And domains were used in the 1970s

222
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,280
because when the Internet was born,

223
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,600
there were no domains.

224
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,880
So, you would then

225
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,800
email or log in to like john@

226
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,240
and then you give an internet address

227
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,520
like UCLA.

228
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,280
But nobody wanted to remember that

229
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,520
so, domains themselves were invented

230
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,880
so that people could write john@UCLA.edu

231
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,360
or john@stanford.edu

232
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,040
I did not know

233
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,360
that's why domains were invented,

234
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,560
by the way.

235
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,800
Domains actually are older than the web.

236
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,760
The web is 1989

237
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,680
of the world wide web, html, 1989.

238
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,600
And before that, people had,

239
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,080
you know, people had email addresses

240
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,720
at Stanford, UCLA, Caltech

241
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,840
and also in HP.

242
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,440
So, but yeah.

243
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,160
Because the first killer app

244
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,000
of the internet was probably email.

245
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,720
And email needed domain.

246
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,360
Email help create domains.

247
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,760
And then the second killer app

248
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,760
was really up the web later on.

249
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,440
For sure.

250
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,160
So, then talk to me

251
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,120
a little bit about this,

252
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,880
about more broadly this domain problem.

253
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,560
And why do you need 13 patents

254
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,400
to address that?

255
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,920
Domains or DNS,

256
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,400
which is domain name system,

257
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,680
it was invented so that

258
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,240
you did not have to memorize

259
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,600
an Internet address,

260
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,760
which were then like

261
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,000
10.15.25.128.

262
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,560
Something that is meaningless,

263
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,200
even for engineers.

264
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,040
And back then,

265
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,280
when domain's were invented,

266
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,680
the older users of the web,

267
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,456
let's say an e-mail

268
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:09,120
were the hard core researchers.

269
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,720
There's nobody.

270
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,760
There were engineers and professors

271
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,120
and grad students throughout the US.

272
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,280
So, they were serious people.

273
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,560
But even they could see

274
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
the immediate use

275
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,000
of a domain name system.

276
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,560
MIT.ed was simple to remember.

277
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,200
And the things like this.

278
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,240
And so, in what I'm doing right now

279
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,440
with this thing called Linket,

280
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
which are an alternative to domains

281
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,120
I faced a similar problem

282
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,760
of people having to memorize

283
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,000
too long alphanumeric strings

284
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,760
that didn't really mean anything.

285
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,960
But then I realized,

286
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,600
and so, I remember that day

287
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,960
I was walking to a park in Pasadena

288
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,600
and I was just thinking

289
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,240
about this problem

290
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,200
and I realized that we were we,

291
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,080
the human race were here before

292
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,920
in the 1970s and 80s,

293
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,560
that then they had a problem

294
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,360
of trying to remember internet addresses.

295
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,920
So, you avoid that problem,

296
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,440
DNS is the solution to that.

297
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,520
Here they have something

298
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,360
called deep links

299
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,200
which were used,

300
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,480
which were actually invented

301
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,520
in Silicon Valley in the early 2010s.

302
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,920
And I put it,

303
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,800
but the deep links

304
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,640
that these too long of strings,

305
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,480
one string is just like

306
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,480
an app ID in an app store.

307
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,240
But nobody really wants to remember

308
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,080
an app ID even if you could.

309
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,280
Of course.

310
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,600
Yeah.

311
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,560
And so, I just came up with the idea

312
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,040
of just putting a label on it

313
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,760
and I just had called

314
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,560
the label something.

315
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,440
I couldn't call it domain

316
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,000
because that's not quite what it is,

317
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,800
so, I just thought Linket.

318
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,720
Because it's like link,

319
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,120
like LinkedIn and all that link,

320
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,960
it's a connection.

321
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,160
And also, the big thing for mine

322
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,400
was that right now

323
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,960
they use something called Unicode,

324
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,924
which, you know about it

325
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:41,000
if you could be the programmer.

326
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,480
Unicode is a way to represent

327
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,600
every written human language.

328
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,760
Domains are really A to Z

329
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,160
because when they were invented late 70s,

330
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,840
that's all we had.

331
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,280
Unicode did not exist.

332
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,840
And so, the American engineers

333
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,880
who invented DNS,

334
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,440
they were not trying

335
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,240
to act against other countries,

336
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,960
to discriminate against other countries.

337
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,200
Let me just say that,

338
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,280
because it turns out

339
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,680
domains, you can't even

340
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,840
for European languages

341
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,280
written in Roman alphabet

342
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,200
of all the other

343
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,614
European languages have accents.

344
00:10:08,615 --> 00:10:12,120
So, the Spanish have tilde over the end.

345
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,480
But you can't do a tilde domain,

346
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,880
you can't do French, German,

347
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,200
Italian, none of them.

348
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,280
Let alone the other languages,

349
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,080
would use different alphabets like, well,

350
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,280
like Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew,

351
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,880
Arabic and all that, you just can't.

352
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,280
So, right now,

353
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,400
with my stuff with Linket.

354
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,800
I start with Unicode.

355
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,400
Which means I can do

356
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,600
all the languages from scratch right now.

357
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,240
Wow.

358
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,120
So, how do you actually see this unfold?

359
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,600
You mentioned that

360
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,120
you've written a series of patents

361
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,520
to go about this,

362
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,800
even before we continue with Linket,

363
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,000
talk to me about the process

364
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,949
of writing a patent.

365
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,920
You sit down and you have this idea,

366
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
how does it actually work

367
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,760
end to end?

368
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,960
Yeah. Oh, okay.

369
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,560
Actually, I taught classes of this,

370
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,640
like patent to new invention.

371
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,200
Yeah, exactly.

372
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,080
It turns out if you're an engineer

373
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,880
and if you have an

374
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,160
undergraduate degree in engineering

375
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,960
or science,

376
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,600
you can basically write a patent.

377
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,760
You have enough technical training

378
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,200
to do that.

379
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,960
Because it's just like you writing,

380
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,080
like if you are a senior in engineering,

381
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,720
you're writing a term paper

382
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,760
in your senior year

383
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,240
on some of you work in a lab.

384
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,520
And like when you're told

385
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,000
to pretend that just submitting it

386
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,080
to an academic journal,

387
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,760
and may maybe you are,

388
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,240
maybe your professor is.

389
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,200
It's the same sort of thing

390
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,520
that you have to use formal language,

391
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,000
but you don't need

392
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,760
to use any legal language,

393
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,840
despite what a patent attorney

394
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,880
might say to you.

395
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,560
And here's the thing,

396
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,960
like in San Francisco,

397
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,160
when you use a patent attorney,

398
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,040
everything's more expensive

399
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,960
there in San Francisco,

400
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,040
you know, well you already

401
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,680
did know that,

402
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,480
but it could cost easily $5,000

403
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,160
to file a patent application.

404
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,640
That's just to pay the attorney.

405
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,400
And it's about $500

406
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,800
to pay the government.

407
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,320
And then you wait,

408
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,480
oh, but if you are into startups,

409
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,520
you guys, one of the things to do

410
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,320
the good thing to do

411
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,160
is that if you have an idea

412
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,960
about a patent application,

413
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,760
if you have to pay the attorney

414
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,160
or you do it yourself whatever,

415
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,840
you file the patent application,

416
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,560
let's say, next week,

417
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,160
but the government gets it,

418
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,200
but nothing will happen

419
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,000
for the next 18 months.

420
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,360
So then, you would go

421
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,560
with your receipt.

422
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,840
You get a serial number

423
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,080
of the patent application.

424
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,280
Sure.

425
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,800
And then use that to show like investors,

426
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,240
angels and VCs,

427
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,200
and you can build it out

428
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,920
if you can afford it.

429
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,320
Like if it's a mechanical thing,

430
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,600
it's a software ,

431
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,640
because you have 18 months

432
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,920
where nothing will happen

433
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,480
with your patent application.

434
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,760
So, that's the way to do it.

435
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,360
You should not file, like just

436
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,080
you shouldn't build it first and file

437
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,960
because you lose the time.

438
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,880
And time is everything.

439
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,720
So, what happens if you file a patent

440
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,200
and then within those 18 months

441
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,880
you have other people that are filing

442
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,694
those provisional patents

443
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,400
on a similar idea.

444
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,800
Well that's just it, okay,

445
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,200
that 18 months,

446
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,080
you just don't know.

447
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,000
You really don't know.

448
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,160
Because the provisionals,

449
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,960
they are published

450
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,160
or even the patents pending,

451
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,720
which is what I do.

452
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,960
I do not file provisionals.

453
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,240
I filed the full patents pending

454
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,400
a patent pending.

455
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,240
That's a bit more expensive.

456
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,280
But anyway, for the 18 months

457
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,000
your application will be published.

458
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,290
So, nobody else could see it

459
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,920
for 18 months.

460
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,400
But it also means you can't see.

461
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,880
So, you don't know

462
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,160
that the next 18 months,

463
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,080
if somebody else was actually

464
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,320
did it early before you.

465
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,040
So, it's a little bit nerve racking,

466
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,240
especially if you have a valuable idea.

467
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,320
Now the following year

468
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,040
is just like empirical.

469
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,640
But put it this way,

470
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,680
in that 18 months,

471
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,200
every week, like, for example,

472
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,400
when you look at

473
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,480
the new patent application

474
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,920
they published every week,

475
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,240
if you don't see somebody else

476
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,520
coming up with your idea,

477
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,360
then every week the odds improve

478
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,280
that your idea was the first.

479
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,400
It's not a proof,

480
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,600
but it's just like playing the odds.

481
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,560
Of course.

482
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,720
Especially,

483
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,160
and it increases the odds

484
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,800
that Google and Microsoft

485
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,440
and other big companies have new idea.

486
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,280
Because once they

487
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,440
have filed a patent application,

488
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,080
they don't have to wait, they or you,

489
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,240
once you get a receipt back

490
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,200
from the government,

491
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,160
you can talk about it

492
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,680
the next day.

493
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,680
Right.

494
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,880
And so when you look

495
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,400
at Google or Microsoft,

496
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,320
if they have filed a patent application,

497
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,520
like of the same idea as yours,

498
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,640
like yesterday,

499
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,200
then today they could just publicize,

500
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,600
they could publish them with themselves,

501
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,040
on their blog, whatever,

502
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,040
they were allowed to do that legally.

503
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,720
But they have all the money in the world

504
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,640
to do that, to scare people away.

505
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,880
If they don't do that,

506
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,760
they probably haven't done that.

507
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,720
Yeah. I love the rationale.

508
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,683
So, Wes, tell me a little bit

509
00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:33,280
about Linket.

510
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,120
You've written your last few patents

511
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,700
based on this, on the domain space.

512
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:39,800
From my understanding,

513
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:40,999
what you're trying to do

514
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,279
is you're trying to democratize these domains

515
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,360
so that really we can use Unicode,

516
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,560
which really has any character

517
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,520
that we have on our computer

518
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,040
to create those domains.

519
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,600
Why are you doing that

520
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,110
and what are the possible implications

521
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:56,800
of doing this link?

522
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,800
The big first problem is that

523
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,280
for the last 20 years,

524
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,720
the top dot-com domains

525
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,760
that are English words

526
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,640
have been bought by people who speculate.

527
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,720
And there's nothing wrong with that.

528
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,440
But I'm just saying this is

529
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,400
what they've done.

530
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,440
And today the speculators

531
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,680
are called Domainers.

532
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,120
Some of them

533
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,680
do this full time for living.

534
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,800
What does that mean?

535
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,360
What do they do?

536
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,520
Oh, they bought like a domain,

537
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,400
like these are the dot-com domains.

538
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,240
Because the most valuable domains

539
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,640
right now are still

540
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,800
in the dot-com of space.

541
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,120
And so, it will be like reason.com,

542
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,880
ramen.com or curry.com,

543
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,200
things with commercial value.

544
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,988
By the way,

545
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:36,560
is dot-com valuable mainly

546
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,720
because that's what people are used to?

547
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,560
Yes.

548
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,800
That's the only reason right?

549
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,200
Right.

550
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,000
And so, but there's no

551
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,960
intrinsic reason for this, okay?

552
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,200
But as a result of that,

553
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,880
there were now

554
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,760
a thousand top level domains.

555
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,160
In the year 2000,

556
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,640
there was about 200 of TLDs,

557
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,560
the 200 TLDs then were basically

558
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,400
like the dot-com,

559
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,160
like the five or six original of TLDs,

560
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,880
plus the TLDs that were country codes,

561
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,560
the two-letter country codes,

562
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,920
.UK, .AU you know, all those.

563
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,966
And then they added 800 more

564
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:13,160
in the last 20 years,

565
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,280
mostly in the last 10 years.

566
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,760
Those are doing okay,

567
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,440
but nobody's really

568
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,280
making much money on it

569
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,880
from what I understand.

570
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,880
So, yes, anybody can still get a domain

571
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,000
if you don't really care

572
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,320
what the suffixes,

573
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,160
what the TLD you are in.

574
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,000
But by reasons of prestige,

575
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,560
it's like the dot-com years

576
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,560
were responsible for this.

577
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,280
Even the name dot-com.

578
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,320
The dot com bubble, right.

579
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,040
100%.

580
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,920
Yeah.

581
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,520
So, what are you trying to do now

582
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,093
with removing that ending?

583
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:45,160
What it means is that today,

584
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,960
if you are startup in Silicon Valley,

585
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,480
for example, and you want to get like a,

586
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,720
you want the foodservice something

587
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,560
and you want to get like ramen.com,

588
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,520
because maybe you sell

589
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,480
like Indian food or something.

590
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,240
Just like, for that you'd

591
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,840
like to get ramen.com.

592
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,240
But let's say you go there,

593
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,840
you look at somebody else owns it

594
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,320
and they want $20,000 for it.

595
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,280
Now, maybe they want less,

596
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,800
sometimes they can want more.

597
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,080
They can ask whatever amount they want.

598
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,880
Now, they'll give an actual number.

599
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,000
Business.com in 1993,

600
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,320
somebody bought that directly

601
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
from VeriSign for the first time.

602
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,600
And they paid like, back then,

603
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,360
the standard price was like,

604
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,040
$300 a year, something like that.

605
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,960
In 1999, at the height of the dot-com,

606
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,080
it was sold for about five million dollars.

607
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,000
Five million at that time.

608
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,240
And yeah, it's something like that.

609
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,080
It's in the records.

610
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,440
And the price that the buyer bought it

611
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,000
for five million dollars the buyer paid

612
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,320
was probably still a good deal

613
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,360
because since '99,

614
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,720
the web has grown and grown.

615
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,040
And, you know, we added over

616
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,320
a billion people, and yeah,

617
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,440
in India, China, Europe,

618
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,400
as well as America.

619
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,760
So, yeah, you can imagine.

620
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,960
So, that's right.

621
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,400
And so, right now,

622
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,480
what we're doing is that

623
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,360
we are selling these Linkets,

624
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,840
well, $15, that's one, five.

625
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,800
And so, that's

626
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,320
two or three orders cheaper

627
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,640
than you can buy the dot-com,

628
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,045
the equivalent dot-com domain

629
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,440
from a domainer.

630
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,560
And so, how do they look?

631
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,960
So, instead of like okay,

632
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,680
I use the example ramen.com.

633
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,440
I don't really know

634
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,080
how much it's going for,

635
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,600
but that's just like somebody else

636
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,480
wanting like $20,000.

637
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,920
That's about reasonable.

638
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,150
The equivalent Linket,

639
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:24,760
it's just ramen.

640
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,350
with ramen in square brackets.

641
00:18:26,351 --> 00:18:28,259
That's it. Ramen in square brackets.

642
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,040
Yeah. We sell them for $15. One, five.

643
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,679
So, it's three orders in magnitude

644
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,640
less than $20,000.

645
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,840
By the way, I have a question.

646
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,760
Because this is all about

647
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,520
supply and demand.

648
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:38,760
Right?

649
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,920
I mean it's basic economics.

650
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,320
You know, the reason why

651
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,000
ramen.com is high in prices

652
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,720
is because you have a lot

653
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,040
of potential buyers.

654
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,200
So, you increase the price.

655
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,240
But now let's say that somebody buys

656
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,440
from you for $15

657
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,840
the square brackets ramen,

658
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,880
and now there's going to be a demand

659
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,080
as people transition to Linket instead

660
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,240
of the dot-com,

661
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,760
you're going to be the mainstream.

662
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,320
So, it's going to be, again,

663
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,920
a seller's market, right?

664
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,320
Well, yeah.

665
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,920
Well, I think we're selling

666
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,720
too low right now,

667
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,520
but we are just starting.

668
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,040
And so, we have to,

669
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,280
price is one of our

670
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,080
main advantages right now.

671
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,160
And later on we will sell.

672
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,560
Oh, but we also have a reserve list.

673
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,280
Because this is what the domain

674
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,440
registrars are doing today already.

675
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,520
Some of the domains right now,

676
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,240
they'll sell at high prices.

677
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,600
We have a reserve list of words like.

678
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
So, basically right now

679
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,560
it's English words.

680
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,920
And words like Intel,

681
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,600
which doesn't mean Intel Corporation,

682
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,160
the chip maker.

683
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,920
It's just intel means intelligence,

684
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,840
like military intelligence.

685
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,240
So, we'll select the linket,

686
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,640
just intel of the linket,

687
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,960
or computer,

688
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,720
that's all of these we reserve.

689
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,720
And we want to,

690
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,320
we'll start selling these off like

691
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,640
two or three years down the road.

692
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,960
We'll auction it off.

693
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,160
So, we're going to let the market decide.

694
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,240
And our reserved list right now,

695
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,200
it's about 20,000 reserved Linkets.

696
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,040
We're going to grow that to 100,000.

697
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,760
Because we said we do Unicode.

698
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,720
We are going to use, like the word intel,

699
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
we will reserve that

700
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,440
in French and Italian

701
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,360
and German and in Chinese,

702
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,120
all of these.

703
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,400
So, essentially right now with domains,

704
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,160
with the domainers,

705
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,440
everybody's working in English basically.

706
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,240
Right.

707
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,280
Now, with Linkets,

708
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,720
it's dictionaries in every language.

709
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,680
So, we just do it over again.

710
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,360
And that's how we want

711
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,040
to make our money one day.

712
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,040
I think that's just spectacular.

713
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,800
And so, Linket,

714
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,240
I'm guessing it's a company

715
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,120
that is now running.

716
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,200
And is it actually active?

717
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,619
Does it work that I can actually use

718
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,920
for a bracket to go to websites?

719
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,320
Well, yeah.

720
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,880
I mean, people can go,

721
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,800
they can apply it.

722
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,320
And If nobody has it then we'll send,

723
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,640
then they can buy it from us.

724
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,000
If it's not on our reserve list,

725
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,280
we'll sell it to them.

726
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,240
And then we have instructions

727
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,200
which are this is our alpha version.

728
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,880
We have instructions

729
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,560
on how they can,

730
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,120
if they were a coder,

731
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,440
if they were a computer programmer,

732
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
how do they get like mod

733
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,760
their web pages to use the Linkets.

734
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,840
It's early days right now.

735
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,240
There's a long way to go.

736
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
But right now,

737
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,880
I'd like to think

738
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,640
that right now it's like

739
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,000
in 1992 when you could buy business.com

740
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,280
for the first time.

741
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,000
Even if you didn't know

742
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
how to write a webpage,

743
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,920
even if you did know HTML,

744
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,280
just only because when you buy

745
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,280
the domain today, even today,

746
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,320
you still don't have do anything with it.

747
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,280
You don't [--] website,

748
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,040
you could just own it.

749
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,560
I remember, we have an interesting story

750
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,560
when my uncle bought shoes.com

751
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,480
many years ago and it obviously

752
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,600
became very valuable actually.

753
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,880
And it actually

754
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,320
it prompted him and his partners

755
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,800
to start a company called shoes.com

756
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,600
which later sold.

757
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,960
But, I did definitely understand

758
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,320
the value of domain.

759
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,280
But Wes, I want to thank you

760
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,560
for being so generous with your time.

761
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,720
I love this conversation.

762
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,960
So much energy.

763
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,720
And I just love going all the way

764
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,920
back to the beginning.

765
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,160
You saying how lucky you are

766
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,880
to be in a place where

767
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,680
you feel like you're back

768
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,480
in grad school in Caltech

769
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
and doing these

770
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,040
extraordinary research things.

771
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,200
And I just love your passion, enthusiasm.

772
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,680
So, thank you for sharing that.

773
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,360
Before we leave, the hardest question.

774
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,200
I need three words that you would use

775
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,160
to describe yourself.

776
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,960
Intelligent, inventor, engineer.

777
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,655
I love that.

778
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:25,560
Wes, thank you very much.

779
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,520
Best of luck with Linket.

780
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,160
I'm going to go buy

781
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,280
my own Linket right now.

782
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,840
Thank you very much for everything.

783
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,440
And stay safe and stay healthy.

784
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,760
Yeah. You're welcome.

785
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,120
Thank you.
