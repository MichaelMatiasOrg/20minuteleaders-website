1 I'm just a person that was very lucky, I did something that I liked since I was a kid, which was writing code. Getting into computers at the time it wasn't a popular thing. Oren Dobronsky, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? Very good. Thank you for having me. I am blushing. I'm a huge, huge fan, I have to say. I'm a huge fan on several fronts. First of all, your Hummus helped me get through many final exams at Stanford, not just me, but about all of my dorm. It's Stanford's favorite restaurant, I have no doubt. The second thing is the direct flight between San Francisco and Tel Aviv. I believe you had quite an important hand in making that happen. So, my father, myself and everybody else, really thank you for that. But more importantly than that, Oren, you have an incredible, streamline of entrepreneurship endeavors that you've had. Most recently, an incredible unclear, given that I can't wait to hear about it. But also a pretty prominent, now TV persona, through the Sharks in Israel. So, wow. Oren, how did you do so many things? I don't know. I guess I can't help it. That's the right answer. I love that answer. But tell me how you started. You went to Mamram, and from there how does this happen? So, I consider myself very lucky. That's the bottom line. I'm just the person that was very lucky. I did something that I liked since I was a kid which was writing code. Getting into computers at the time it wasn't a popular thing. My parents used to shout at me, you know, "Why don't you go out and play?" And I said, "I just love it." And I used to play a lot with my computer. And then it was very natural for me to go to Mamram. And when I was leading the army, it was '96 and I really had this vision of what the Internet can happen. And back then, in Israel in '96, very few people thought, you know, about the upcoming revolution. So, I started my first startup in '97 just because I felt that again. This was like I had to do something about it and I created my first startup. It was the first Craigslist. I didn't even know about Craigslist, but I still get to Craigslist in Israel. A bulletin board. And I mean, the year wasn't, the market wasn't ready. So, I had to close that the year later. It was a big heartache. And thank God I had a girlfriend at the time who told me, "You must work on the second one." I told her, "You know, it doesn't work this Internet." And she said, "No no no. You must do it." And so I started my second one. And then I basically hit the jackpot. I came up with a concept of toolbar. And I hold the patent over toolbar and that became history. Unbelievable, literally everywhere. That is Hotbar, correct? Right. That was Hotbar. We had an estimate that we had like one in every four computers in the world had our toolbar installed, at the time. That is just unbelievable. Talk to me a little bit about that resilience of being a young entrepreneur. Your first startup fails. With the inspiration and motivation from your girlfriend, you moved on to the second startup and it skyrockets to the point where you are literally in a quarter of the computers in the world. What was that transition like? How do you fathom that transition? Well, you know, even then, the mindset, it was so, everything was so, every day there were new things. People didn't really know. They would know today. It's funny today when you start stuff, there's so much material to read about and to learn, you know, even when you went to Stanford. At the time there was nothing. Anyone who did anything in the Internet space, it was all discovered. It was a totally like the Wild West. I think about it this way. You know, we needed to invent, you know, from the methodology. And what are you going to do, how you're going to do, there were no tools. You need to build everything yourself. Obviously, there was no cloud. So, we needed really to figure out what we were doing. And, you know, it's also the market's modification. Then 2000 came and everything tanked. And we needed to, you know, stay afloat in a very difficult year. Unbelievable. Different times. I have to say that, you know, I spent five years in 8200 which was a phenomenal experience. I'm sure a very similar to the experience in Mamram. And then, going to California and seeing what's happening there, literally every corner at Stanford there's a class teaching you how to start a startup. Every kid that walks on campus is thinking, "What am I going to do?" In 97, 98, that wasn't the case. You didn't have a class in every corner helping you, which is amazing. No, there was nothing. You know, I needed to explain that what I'm doing is I'm a computers company in a special field called the Internet. It was kind of a subset of being in computers. Wow. That is just unbelievable. I want to fast forward the journey a little bit. And I want to make sure that we very soon get clear, giving them all your most recent endeavor. But you have two stints along the way that are very irregular for the average, you know, Silicon Valley entrepreneur. The first one is something that we can all thank you for allowing us to travel back and forth to Tel Aviv and San Francisco. That is a startup by itself, it sounds like, because that was quite a journey. Tell me a little bit about that. Well, that was totally an irrational thing to do, right? So, I was living in the valley. I moved to the valley in 2008. So, first I moved to New York in 2000. I lived there eight years. I already sold my startup Hotbar. I exited, I made some money and I had another one. That one also went well. And then I moved to the Valley. And then living in the Valley, having to take this daunting flight to Tel Aviv once or twice a year when you need to stop somewhere and collect your luggage and move it to a different terminal and all kind of crazy shit, I just said, "This cannot be the case." So, you know, I contacted United and they said to me, "You know, Oren, there's just not enough demand." And I said, "Well, this is not possible." There are so many startups here, so many Israelis. But not just Israel here, there are so many American startups that are, you know, I have a location in Israel that need to fly people from Google to phase, I mean, anyone I knew. Yes. There's a big, big center in Tel Aviv. And so, I decided to do a petition. And, you know, and about 10,000 people signed a petition committing to flight of 36,000 flights roundtrip tickets. And with that, I basically came back to all the airlines and I said, "Guys, there is a demand." And there was a phase there, you know, that United just got tired of me. And, you know, it's funny because after they launch that direct line, two months after that they had this national convention, they have an annual convention with all the managers meeting United. And the guy who is in charge on route planning is going to the stage and he says the following. He said, "I don't know how these Israelis remodel all our algorithms. But this is the number one flight in our network and we couldn't see it." That is really unique. How do you explain that? Is it that did they fly under the radar? You know, look, I think that they look at Tel Aviv and San Francisco as two random locations like Boston and Rome, okay?. I told them, "No, these are two tech hubs that the companies who work in these places will definitely use your business class." Yes. "If they have an option to fly direct, they will not fly in direct because of price." Yes. You know, maybe it's my fault that the prices went so high. But United said, you know, "Okay. So, let's have a bigger business class. Let's charge a lot of money." And guess what? People just were willing to pay any price to have a direct flight instead of wasting a day. I mean, it's a very simple market. Right? On one hand, when you have the regular flight, you're applying to the larger market, most of it is business and leisure. But here, not many people take a vacation to San Francisco. Right? So, I think that's just [--]. But that was minor compared to the innovative nature of Oren's Hummus that I you know, I have to say, Oren, I'm in Tel Aviv, I ate hummus here every day. And somehow I find myself missing your restaurant. No, no way. You are too sweet. But you introduced the Jaffa. Right? The off menu Jaffa dish that one of the waiters told me about. And since then... So, tell me a little bit about why start a Hummus Restaurant? So again, you know, as an entrepreneur, you just can't help it. But you always see what needs to be done. You always say, what is missing, what can be done with this, what is not, you know. Here I have to admit that not only that I saw how much it was missing, I myself, miss hummus. Yes. I used to go eat hummus before I board a plane to go to San Francisco. And when I come back, I used the first thing to do is to go to eat hummus. Yes. And I said, "Let's have a place basically for the Israelis." I didn't think about it too much. I just wanted a place for us. And my wife thought at the time that I was a little bit crazy. And I told her, "You know, Nancy, you're right. Consider it like a midlife crisis. But we'll have a place." And she has experience. I was very lucky to have her because she has a restaurant experience. And so, she helped me open it in the beginning because I didn't know what I was doing. And the one thing that I insisted on is that you will keep it like the best quality possible. We were not aiming into profitability. We say we are going to, let me give you an example. So, from day one, we would import the grains themselves from Israel in a boat. Think about it. The grain needs to go halfway around the world to be on your plate. And the tahini, we bought the whole pita machine because there were no decent pitas in the dairy. So, it was really, how would I say it, it was not a financial project, it was a project that comes from the soul. And, you know, some people are saying that this is the recipe for success. I don't know if that's true. But it really came from a place to do the best, the best food I can do. My only goal was, I mean, other than financing it, my only goal was to make sure that the taste is the way I remember it. To be as authentic, because some people along the way suggested, maybe we should adjust it to the American palate. And I said, "No way. We are going to do it exactly the way it is in Israel." And I think that's where the charm is. That suddenly there was such different taste, such a different experience. I mean, when we opened, we had Americans who came in. And the fact that you use your hand to rip the pita and scoop it, it was like mind blowing. A hummus eating guy. We explain how to do it because people didn't know how to do it. And you know, somebody told me this is the best place for a date. You just come and you share and you I mean, it's unique. So, when you say that you miss it, when you're in Israel, you know, in Israel there is a hummus in every corner,. And people are like diehard fans of one hummus and they will never step into another hummus. California was a desert. I mean, if they were anywhere near a decent hummus, I wouldn't have the opened. The only reason I opened is that I couldn't find anything decent. And Oren, of course, I have to mention that the missing ingredient from everything that you mentioned which exists there, is when you walk down University Avenue or Castro, you hear Shlomo Artzi coming from one of the restaurants and that just warms the heart of every Israeli that walks there. But Oren, we have to... And that's totally my wife. That's totally my wife. Yes. That's genius. We have to fast forward because we only have 20 minutes. We have to still talk about Clear Giving. And we completely skipped over the fact that you're a huge TV celebrity in Israel now, known as a startup guru, investing as part of the Shark Tank show. But we'll leave that for another discussion. Oren, after all of that incredible success and endeavors, which I have to say that the most inspirational part for me is not the toolbar and it's not the startup in '97, it's about this lifelong mentality of being an entrepreneur. And it's about your motivation to go and fix whatever you see happening around you. And I think that is just so incredible. And that's a mentality that I wish for myself, I wish for all my friends, for everybody that's surrounding me. So, I really want to thank you for that. Talk to me a little bit about Clear Giving. What happened that you said, "Now I want to make a social impact."? Yeah. So, Clear Giving is actually a continuation of a project that I did for many years before that. So, when I had some money to give and I really started to struggle where I'm giving it. I felt that just giving it to the first random nonprofit is just not the right thing. You need to treat it with respect as if this is, you know, you are serious about getting it to the right places. And none of the non-profits, none of the organizations that I worked with offered the level of transparency that I would use to, I usually give a big sum of money but you don't really know what happened to it. You don't know what impact, you don't know where it goes, you have no control of where it go. So, for many years I used to employ an individual who used to find me families in need that I could support them directly. So, after doing that for more than 10 years, I basically decided, you know what? How about taking it to the next level. How about productizing it and basically doing, again, what I wished would be, what I started giving, which is basically someone who could build for you a portfolio of families. And that's basically how I started Clear Giving. I basically said, "We will make a website where we first of all, we screen families that need support in Israel. We get them all from the HaRevaha, which is the social services in Israel, then governmental social services. We screen them, they need to pass certain criteria before we upload a certain profile of them on the website. Obviously, it's anonymous. You cannot know who they are, but you get to know their story. So, you as a donor, you can go into the website and choose families you want to support. Amazing. We initially report it like adopt a family. Some people felt it's like too much. So we said, let's call it Clear Giving. Another big feature other than knowing who you're giving the money is that we set a 100% of the donation goes to the family. So, we separate the operation, of course, we have dedicated donors for operational cost. At this point, it's me. But in the future, it can be other people as well. But the vast majority of donors, if they give a dollar, then the dollar goes to a needy family. So, that gives you a feeling that you are not, we are not, there's no conflict of interest. I like to say, it's the biggest bang for the buck. You give $10,000, $10,000 go to families and there's nothing being taken out. I have to ask because first of all, regarding that last point, it's fascinating because, because when they do take a cut or a margin from the donation then obviously, the more they market the more they make. And then there's a conflict of interest. But I have to ask about the distinction. A lot of the nonprofits that I'm aware of and a lot of the organizations, you give them the money and they promise that they'll disseminate it to those that are in need. But you don't have that story. You're missing that individuality aspect. And when you're mentioning that you're telling the story of a family, even though it's anonymous, I feel like I'm giving to that family. So, tell me about that business model. You picked it. So, I want to make that, I want to give the benefit to you as a donor that you know who you helped. It's like if it wasn't for you, they did not had food on the table. Right? I mean, this is literally, you chose them, you picked them and your money is going to them and you get reports to the last cent. You know where it went. Another important thing that you said is that we believe that helping people in need is something that, you know, people who need food, people who need clothing, people who need basic, basic things. I want to help them. You know, there are many, many nonprofits today that help on a higher magnitude. We will build a big matnas. You know what a matnas is? A big school. Like a community center, yeah. We will change poverty. You know what? I think it's important. But I think it's also important to help the poor person who cannot feed his kids or who cannot buy his daughter, you know, [--] because he doesn't have money. And just think about the drama that these people are living in. If you can help them get something, you know, so basic that we all are taking for granted. I think that's a big mitzvah. I think people need to think about it when they do philanthropy, they need to say, you know, I have big, big goals and I have, you know, immediate help that I can offer. I like to say it's like, you're planning a financial portfolio. You sometimes invest in high risk, you go to startups and you go to make equity, but you also have bonds and with low risk products. And the same thing here. You need to think long term, but you also need to get fish to the poor person standing at your door and is asking. You cannot tell him, "Oh, no, I'm going to send the kid to the university." You know, that's nice. I'm going to give a tuition to a kid like a scholarship. Yeah, that's nice. But what about the young people who need the help right now? So, I like to think that this is the solution. What we started doing and I think it's valuable to say is that we started as really offering this service to anyone with a credit card so people could, you know, give $10 or five dollar, whatever they want, they can give. And it's a monthly thing that they support a family. By the way, whenever we get to $200 a month, that's what we want to raise per family then that family goes off the site and now we will help another family. Wow. So, that's the quota. But my point is that we recently started doing basically a service to bigger donors. So, people who want to give me $10,000 or $20,000. What we said is that we will build a portfolio for them, think about it as a managed portfolio. Yes. I was just about to ask about that. So, if $200 a month, right, times 12, it's 24. For $2400 a year, you can basically take a family in need, families with very difficult stories and basically move them into a totally different place. It might not change them. It's not that they are not poor anymore, but you take so much drama, bad drama out of their life. You give them support, you give them the basics. Now, whatever extra money they have they use in buying something. They buy new shoes for their kids or stuff like that. But if you may even think about it, for almost 11,000, right? 10,800, you help five families a year. I don't think other nonprofits can offer something like that because usually, again, when you think long term, then you need to invest more. When it takes longer and then things are more costly. But here, for $11,000, you basically can help five families. And this is what we are aiming now. We are aiming now for people who basically come to me and say, look, I'm giving you a budget, think about like a bank account, I'm giving you a budget, and you will build me a portfolio of families. These families will stay with them. We are not going to switch them. They will be your families. We will update you what's going on with them. From time to time they might write you a letter. But basically you will know that you support these families. I think that's remarkable. When you mentioned about the families not being poor anymore, but at least they'll give them comfort. I'm a huge fan of the pyramid of Maslow. I remember when I learned about it, first in middle school, I understood it so well. I was going through a heartache with a girlfriend and I couldn't function because I didn't have that baseline field. And I can only imagine how difficult it is for a family. And I'm very privileged to come from a family where I never had to worry about food on the table. But by giving them the food, by giving them some comfort, you're allowing them to think more critically about how they can then improve on the other things. And it's like you're a rolling ball. It's a spiral. I love it. Think about the shame of the parents that need to look into the kid's eyes when they cannot afford buying them shoes. You know, when I think about it, I'm starting to howl. I'm tearing up right now. Because I have kids. If I would have a situation that I could not afford buying them something that is pretty much basic that other kids have, you know, this is a terrible situation. So, the $200 a month is as small as it sounds, makes a huge difference for these families. Unfortunately, there are so many families here in Israel, now, especially you know, we didn't speak about that, but now with the corona, you know, I returned to Israel for a year. I took a gap year now in August for a year after 20 years in the States. And, you know, I was shocked. The corona literally took families who were already in a good place and put them in a bad place. Those that were in a bad place it put them in a place that you cannot imagine. So, the level of poverty, usually you don't see it, because when you stay Tel Aviv, Tel Aviv is like another country. It's like the Silicon Valley. It's like the state of Tel Aviv, yeah. Right. When you move out of Tel Aviv and you go Holon and Lod and Ramla, you know, all these places, you cannot believe what stories we found. And again, I would say, you know, if now is a time, if there was ever a time to give to help people directly, it's now. Now it's not a time to say, You know what? I'm going to save for your tuition. I'm going to change the education system. Now is the time to just give. Oren, thank you for all the amazing work that you're doing. You are touching literally so many lives before this, after this, during this. Thank you very, very much. Before we leave, I have to ask you the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. Oh, my goodness. Well, I'm definitely entrepreneur. Yeah. But I would like to say that I'm a world benefactor. That's my goal in life. A world benefactor. Yeah. I want to make this world a better on many levels. That's how I see myself. Entrepreneur, world benefactor. I love it. Oren, toda raba. Thank you very, very much. Okay my friend. Thank you for having me. Of course. Thank you for having me.
