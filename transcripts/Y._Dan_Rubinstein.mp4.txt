1 So, at a certain level, if you have this kind of CEO mentality and I tell everyone I work with, don't wait for, you have license to lead. Dan Rubinstein, thank you for being on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? I'm doing great. Thank you for having me here. Of course, I have to say that I love the brightness of your space. It's very important for me to also be in a bright space as I work. And it looks like you have a great setup. And I have to, before we dive into all the incredible stuff that you've done, whether it's running a company that had over 120 patents, or being an executive at various of the most well-known companies, you're a songwriter. Tell me about that. Yes. It's something I fell into, actually. When my son was five years old he got interested in taking violin lessons. The reason he got interested in violin lessons is actually also a funny story. We took him to a symphony concert and he saw that violinist was the one that was setting the tuning for the entire orchestra. Right. The first violinist. Right. And so he said, "Oh, I want to study the violin." I love that. He wants to lead. So, we signed him up for violin lessons. And normally it was during the workday. So, my wife would take him in the afternoon. And one day she couldn't make it. She was also working at the time. And so I said, "Sure, I'd be happy to take him." And I went there with him and I was so excited to do something like that with him. I came home and I told my wife, "I'm going to study violin together with him." She looks at me, she goes, "You're crazy. You play the guitar already. Why don't you do more with guitar?" And so, I ended up looking for how can I expand my horizons with guitar. I ended up studying jazz guitar. And then, as I was learning all these chords and melodies, I started setting poetry to the music. And over time I just started writing more and more songs. And it's been fun. I've actually, I'm about to publish an album in a few weeks. My first album, it's called, Stolen Moments. Stolen Moments. I have to say I'm surprised that I'm not surprised. It keeps amazing me how the busiest people that I get to interview are the ones that are doing the most amazing things and the ones that are following their passions. And I just love it. I have to say that I'm also drawing a very big pile to my own father. He's a fantastic mathematician. He's also in the high tech industry for a long time. But he's a jazz musician. And he plays with his friends all the time. And you make time for your passions. I just love it. But Dan, you know, Princeton Masters and Masters at Stanford, PhD in Statistics in Stanford. You go on to be the president and the CEO of Reflectivity. Right? It's sold to Texas Instruments with over 120 patents. And so, your whole journey, then moving on to Google and Facebook and Palantir, talk to me a little bit about, did you plan ahead to do so many incredible things on your journey? Was there any strategy in planning this ahead? You know, I'll tell you, it's a funny story. Because I don't think you can predict 10, 20, 30 years out. Everyone thinks they know what they're going to be doing, but it's very hard to know where the world is going to go. So, when I was growing up, both my parents were engineers. And I got very interested in engineering. And at the end of high school, I started we had an apple to clone, but my dad had built from a kit and sold it himself. And I started getting interested in programming it. And one of the first programs, serious programs that I built was actually a program to conjugate Hebrew verbs. Wow. So, yeah. It was a very nice program. I created shape tables for all the Hebrew alphabet. And you know, the Hebrew grammar is very mathematical and orderly, so you can actually create a very clear algorithm for how to conjugate different words based on their letters. And when I was applying to universities, the guy who interviewed me for Princeton was actually an engineer and a linguist, and he got very interested in what I was doing. And he said, "Look, if you get into Princeton, send me a letter. And if you know how to code, I can hire you." He was working at Bell Northern Research in Montreal doing speech recognition. And so from there, I got very interested in, this is automated speech recognition. Today, everyone takes it for granted that you can pick up your phone and talk to Siri. But back then, this was new groundbreaking stuff. And I got very interested and very passionate in how do you train computers to recognize human speech, human handwriting, all these kinds of questions. And that's what led me to go to Stanford and get my PhD in that field. Driven by curiosity. That's what I'm hearing here. Very, very cool. Before you continue, because it has to go side by side with this, this curiosity also leads you to then create a company that is steered by curiosity, where you don't just stumble upon creating a 120 patents selling to Texas Instruments? So, that's actually funny, because when I was at Stanford finishing my PhD in statistics, the thing that I thought I was going to do, and this is back in 1998, which is constantly the same time that Google was getting started, I thought I was going to go and start a data mining company. I was taking entrepreneurship classes at Stanford, learning, including at the business school, thinking about, okay, I want to start a company. I'm very interested in data. Internet was I mean, the websites were coming up on the Internet. So, this is all very new and very exciting. And so, that's where I was headed. And then my roommate, my grad school roommate, came up with a way of making a micromirror display. So, this is a tiny display on a chip. I actually have one here on my desk to share with you. I don't know if you can see it. Yes. That silver thing in the middle there is actually a 1024 x 768 high resolution display. So, on this little chip, there is almost a million little mirrors that move their electrostatic they're actuated. Each pixel corresponds to one of these mirrors. You apply a voltage and electrode under the mirror and the mirrors is electrostatic attracted and bends. And so, you can control where the light goes. You shine a bright light on it, if the mirror is flat the light bounces from that pixel and you don't see it. And if you apply voltage, the pixel bends and the light reaches the projector and then reduce it. And you get color by spinning red, green, blue light. And so, we started a company called, Reflectivity to develop these micro displays for business projectors and large screen TVs. The classic dorm story. Yeah. If anyone knew what they were doing, they would never start this company because it was the most difficult, technically challenging thing. So, the patents, it's not like we had 120 patents that we knew going into it that, oh, we're going to invent all this thing. No. Dan, you needed so much new technology to make it work. Yeah. We had a 120 problems that resulted in 120 patents. So, we had so many innovative things that we did there. We built our own H-System. We actually were talking to companies like Applied Materials to license our H-System. So, building this chip required so much surrounding technology that it just, you know, necessity, is the mother of invention. If you have a problem you have to invent a solution. That's where it came from. I'm already upset that we only have 20 minutes for this interview. And that's why I have to move forward. Because you go from there, you sell to Texas Instruments, you become a product management director at Google then Facebook, and then you find yourself as an entrepreneur in residence at Khosla Ventures, one of the most well known venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, primarily focused on health care, right? I believe that's Khoslas. And he came to speak to one of my classes and he was talking about the future of technology with health care, and it was mind blowing. What was that about? Why become an entrepreneur in residence after being an executive in three companies? So, what happened was while I was at Facebook, my dad started getting, complaining of lower back pain and we thought he had sciatica. He thought he had sciatica. And this went on for months. And it turned out he actually had stage 4 lung cancer that had metastasized to his bones. And it didn't get diagnosed for a long time properly. And by the way, this is a PSA, if you have any relatives over 65 that don't have a reason for their lower back pain, they didn't have a chronic back pain for many years, so they didn't have an acute trigger, one of the things you should go look for is could it be cancer. Anyway, he wasn't a smoker, so there's no indication that he had, and he had no symptoms of lung cancer per se. And this kind of set me an idea, why is it, and this is 2012, why are we in 2012 and something so basic doesn't get diagnosed in time. Just the idea that companies like Amazon, and Google and Facebook, you know, you go to Amazon, they know what you want to buy before you do, right? You go to Google, you type a few letters and Google tells you the whole sentence of what you're searching for. Why aren't they focusing on also diagnosing cancer. Yeah. Or, why isn't health care better use technology and data the way these companies do. And at least in the US, there's several reasons for this. I think the major one is that we have this approach to data privacy that causes siloed data. Right. Companies like Amazon and Google and Facebook, they aggregate the data across all users and builds very sophisticated predictive models from that. Health care, for the most part, especially in the US, doesn't work that way, right? Data is protected. It's siloed. And the efforts, I don't think there's enough being done to really leverage the data and technology. Right. So, I got interested in health care and seeing if we can bring this approach, this philosophical approach from the high tech world to the health care world. And I didn't know anything, other than being a patient from time to time, you know, I didn't really know much about health care. So, I thought I would spend a couple of years just trying to immerse myself, see where I could learn, where I could help. And so, the first opportunity actually was, I had known Vinod for many years, because when we were fundraising for Reflectivity, we actually pitched him. Really? I think he was still at Kleiner Perkins at the time, if I'm not mistaken. Again Dan, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I have to just draw a parallel. Because when I ask you, we're in April of 2014, after you've had such a fantastic career already that the vast majority of people in high tech can only dream of, right? Selling your own company that is doing deep technology, then being a product management director of two of some of the most well sought out companies. And then you're saying that you wanted to spend a few year s to immerse yourself in new technologies and feed that inner curiosity. And that's I think that's the most inspirational that I'm gaining from this whole journey. It's this driven by curiosity to the Stanford PhD to solving a problem that turns into 120 problems, to then immersing yourself in health care because of a personal story. I'm sorry, I just had to put that in there. Please continue. Yeah. So, what I really liked about Vinod, he has a very strong vision perspective around how health care should be done. And it aligned very much with the way I was thinking, you know. Essentially, how can we superpower clinicians and doctors using technology in new and innovative ways. And so, I was lucky. He was very kind. And I was able to get a position as an entrepreneur and residence there. And it really allowed me to see new companies, help out in due diligence. And I was planning to spend quite a while there. And while I was there, Palantir reached out and recruited me to come in for a senior product role at their company. And they had a health care practice as well, which was aligned with what I was interested in. So, I thought, sure, let's go do this. And then ultimately, after about a year, I kind of decided if I was going to do, the kind of vision I had for my health care startup was not going to be easily done there. So, I set out on my own, and joined forces with my colleague Cameron Marlow, who was the former head of data science at Facebook. And we started Physera together. First of all, it's a fantastic colleague to bring on board. Physera, it's the company that you're currently running. Tell me a little bit about it. And what I particularly like to also hear from you is what is it like being a second time entrepreneur with your own company that you're founding? How is the process different from the get go, not just in terms of the experience and the knowledge that you already have, but also in terms of the perception and getting people to buy into what you're doing, which is often one of the most difficult things for a first time entrepreneur? Yeah. Look, I think obviously any time you do something twice, you get better at it the second time. I think, one of the mistakes a lot of entrepreneurs make, and I certainly made this myself the first time around, you waste a lot of time on things that don't actually matter, right? So, and what I'm going to say is going to sound obvious. But when you do a company, there's going to probably one, two or small number of things that you need to do exceptionally well, that are different, that are new, that no one else is doing. And that's where you should be. 95% of your time should be focused on that. And then there's all these other things that you need to do, like the corporation who gets what shares, hiring employees, the accounting, the lease, the real estate. And an entrepreneur, unfortunately, especially when you're starting out, you don't have money, so you can't hire all these people. So, you end up doing a lot of that yourself. But the quicker you can get out of that game, the faster. Now, the good news is if I just look at the changes that happened in the world between, when I started my first company in 1998 and the second company in 2015, it's not that much time. But the world has changed dramatically, and all the things, now, you have WeWork, you don't need to go and figure out long term office. Just go and get a desk at WeWork and you can get started right away. There's software to start up your own company. You don't need to hire accountants. There's all these things that you can do. So, if anything, I think starting a company these days has become much, much easier. And you get to leverage from all these services and cloud computing that you didn't have before. 100%. 100%. So, I have to ask, you know, we just have a couple of minutes left. Dan, you do so many things. You had so many experiences. What was the most fun you've had? Like, what do you enjoy being the CEO, do you enjoy being the PM, the entrepreneur in residence? Which part of the puzzle? Look. I think every job I've had, I think there's been something amazing and fun on it. And in some ways they're very similar, in some ways they're different. So, when I went from being a CEO of my own company to going to Google, one of the things I realized very quickly is actually, a certain level of obstruction. It's all the same. When you're a CEO of a company, you have employees, you have to convince your board, you have competitors. You go to a company like Google, the entities, they have different labels and different names, but it's actually, the same kinds of things. Instead of having to convince investors, you have to convince management to fund a certain project. You want to get an engineer on your team, it's just it's almost the same as recruiting an engineer to come join your company. So, at a certain level, if you have this kind of CEO mentality, and I tell everyone I work with, don't wait for you have license to lead. License to lead. I like that. Whatever you do in your company, whether you're marketing or sales, whatever function you have, you have license to lead. Bring the CEO mindset to your work. So, you're not just doing a narrow thing. Think about how it impacts the broader problem. And I think, you get a lot of satisfaction when you feel like I have ownership of not just what I'm doing, but everything. It just becomes very satisfying. So, when you ask me what's been the most fun? It's all been fun. Because I bring the same mindset to everything I do. I love it. I just love it. Before we end this, I have to thank you for being a source of inspiration for myself and many others within J-Ventures, the early stage fund we're both involved with. Whether it's the screening meetings that I just love hearing both you and [--] and everybody else's, but also in the monthly meetings. Tell me a little bit about, about your experience with J-Ventures and investing in general, because you're wearing both hats, right? You're both taking three hats. Tech executive, entrepreneur and investor. Is it just a big mishmash? Or are you really differentiating into different buckets of your life? Again, I think it's all aligned in the same pursuit of trying to, I mean, you know the concept of Tikkun Olam, which to repair the world, to make the world better. So, in my personal life, this is what I enjoy. This is how I want to spend my time making and finding problems and improving things and making things better. Now, I can achieve that leverage through other people as well. If I invest in someone and help them and mentor them, it's just a way of, in a sense, cloning myself. And so, I actually enjoy helping the next generation of entrepreneurs. It's something that's very meaningful for me. I love it. I love it. So, Dan, I'm warning you that in a few months when I go on my own path as an entrepreneur, I will reach out and seek for some advice and for your help, because I just can only imagine the amount of knowledge and experience you've accumulated. And I personally on a very similar journey with all of my friends that we're thinking of starting some things together. We're pretty much we have one big rule, which is we want to make a really big positive impact and we want to feel satisfied that we're doing something both with the deep technology, but at the same time really meaningful to a big market such as health care, and what you've done both at Physera and with Khosla Ventures. Before we leave, thank you again for being on the show, what are three words that you would use to describe yourself? So, I know you gave me a heads up, Not enough of a heads up, but I'm sorry for that. So, it's ironic, but I wrote this down at the beginning of the interview, so I'm not making this up. Wonderful. I'll show you the notes. It's like, it's curiosity. You can see it. Curious, helpful and efficient. Curious, helpful, efficient. Dan, toda raba. Thank you very, very much. And I'll see you at the next J-Ventures meeting. Looking forward to it. Bye bye.
