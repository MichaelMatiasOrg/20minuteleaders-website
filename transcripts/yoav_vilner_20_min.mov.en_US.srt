1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,240
It always looks like a disaster.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,360
We've done this, oh, my God.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,960
Our clients say that

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,840
we're not going to make it,

5
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,360
we have to fire someone and everything.

6
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,880
If you look at it in the test of,

7
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,600
like a long period of time,

8
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,590
everything works out.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,880
Yoav Vilner,

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,000
thank you so much for being on my show,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,720
20 Minute Leaders.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,040
How are you?

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,760
Great. Thanks for inviting me.

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,160
Of course.

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:51,800
I have to say that

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,920
it's a beautiful balcony

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,840
that you have over there in Tel Aviv.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,280
But I do have to start with actually

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,040
with your fun fact,

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,560
which is the fact

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,040
that you play the ukulele.

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,760
And you showed it to me

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,240
just a second ago behind you there.

24
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,040
We started with that fun fact.

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,720
Now, I know how to play

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,040
What A Wonderful World.

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,840
I taught myself that.

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,360
It took me about three years to learn it.

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,760
So, I have a lot of respect

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,600
to the fact that you claim

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,000
that you play the ukulele.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,880
But I want to spend these 20 minutes

33
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,360
talking about you and your journey.

34
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,400
As we get to the climax

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,040
of the conversation,

36
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,440
your most recent company, Walnut.

37
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,120
I'd love to go back in time

38
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,880
in to your 20s.

39
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,640
Sales, marketing, leadership,

40
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,920
starting your own businesses,

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,560
New York City, Tel Aviv,

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,760
walk me through your journey.

43
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,040
Because I think there's a lot to,

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,200
a lot of lessons to be learned

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,640
about your entrepreneurial journey.

46
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,760
Right.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So, I started my career by accident

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,920
when I was 22.

49
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,520
I wanted to do freelance marketing

50
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,480
for startups.

51
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,880
And, you know, 10 years ago,

52
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,000
the startup nation

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,080
was a little bit smaller,

54
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,400
so there was room to do that

55
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,280
and be the first one.

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,920
So, I did that and it turned out to be

57
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,920
the biggest company in Israel to do that.

58
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,240
We had like 500 clients,

59
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,920
dozens of employees and offices

60
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,160
in Manhattan and London.

61
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,600
So, I had to live in London and Manhattan

62
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,240
like periodically.

63
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,240
And it was a lot of fun.

64
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,520
And after seven years of being the CEO,

65
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,680
I decided I needed to do something more,

66
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,840
something different,

67
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,800
like have more fun.

68
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,040
Yoav, your skipping over

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,000
all over the juicy parts.

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,320
You're 22 years old,

71
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,720
how do you get to run a company

72
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
that has over 500 clients,

73
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,600
with offices in three continents?

74
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't understand that.

75
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,880
You know, I always try to think

76
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,120
of a good word to say.

77
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,800
I was a very shitty CEO to start with.

78
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,760
I had employees that were double my age

79
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,040
and they had kids of their own.

80
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,320
And I've made every mistake possible.

81
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
But you just want to,

82
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,280
what our life in Israel,

83
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,680
the university of life

84
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,680
you have to go through it

85
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,800
much more than anybody.

86
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,480
And it's worked out.

87
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,240
So, going back,

88
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,000
what were some

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,160
of the most monumental moments

90
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,720
or your aha moments

91
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,840
as you were going through this company,

92
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,080
and you're managing the company

93
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,280
first for seven years,

94
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,000
what were some of the most

95
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,600
incredible milestones

96
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,880
that you'll forever keep with you?

97
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,800
I think the first one is

98
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,640
quit your job.

99
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,000
Because I had a very good job

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,800
when I was like 21, 22

101
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,200
when I came back from my after army trip,

102
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,080
which was a year long

103
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,920
in Central America.

104
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,240
And I had a really good job.

105
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,200
Like my friends were like,

106
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,560
"How the hell did you get the job,

107
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,840
while we're trying to figure out

108
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,760
where we're going to study

109
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,720
for the next four years?"

110
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,920
But I just quit it

111
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,320
because I wanted to be

112
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,560
like be my own boss.

113
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,840
So, that was probably

114
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,000
the smartest move I've ever made.

115
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,920
And it changed my life.

116
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah.

117
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,920
And the other thing is,

118
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:09,240
don't worry about being

119
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,320
a very bad founder and CEO

120
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,640
when you're in early 20s,

121
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,080
that's when you have

122
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,440
to make all the mistakes.

123
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,880
But when you get a little bit better,

124
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,840
and older and better and older,

125
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,400
then you're going to be amazing

126
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,960
and have much better background.

127
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,360
And people who have done

128
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,600
an amazing degree

129
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,000
and they were VPs

130
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,240
at some enterprise companies,

131
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,400
you're probably going to beat them

132
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,160
for being the founder.

133
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,120
So, from your experience,

134
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,240
what are some of the most

135
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,960
important things one can do

136
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,440
as a young entrepreneur,

137
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,960
first time entrepreneur,

138
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,640
and in owning those mistakes?

139
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,560
And obviously,

140
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,840
we're all going to make mistakes.

141
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,640
And I'm looking forward

142
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,280
to making many more mistakes

143
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
than I'm already making as I go through

144
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,200
my entrepreneurial journey.

145
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,520
But what do we need to do

146
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,680
in order to keep that in mind

147
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,320
and to own them and to fix them?

148
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,800
You need to start by doing them.

149
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,120
And then,

150
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,520
you know, building a startup,

151
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
it's like every day

152
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,720
it's the worst mistake than before

153
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,400
in every phase of the startup.

154
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:13,960
So, I have to do it.

155
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,760
And if you don't do it,

156
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,680
it's like in the gym,

157
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,560
If it doesn't hurt,

158
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,640
then you're not improving.

159
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,680
So, that's the only way.

160
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:24,040
You need to find yourself

161
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,040
people that you look up to,

162
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,400
and you can give them a call,

163
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,320
give them a WhatsApp message,

164
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,360
annoy them and ask them for,

165
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,035
usually people

166
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:36,000
that are just a bit  older from you,

167
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,880
they have like

168
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,160
an experience running a company

169
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,120
a little bit better than you.

170
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,520
Surround yourself with those people.

171
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
And eventually,

172
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,240
everything always looks like a disaster.

173
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,280
We've done this. Oh my God.

174
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,920
Our clients say that

175
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,800
we're not going to make it,

176
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,400
we have to fire someone,

177
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,360
and everything.

178
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,960
If you look at it,

179
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,600
in the test of a long period of time,

180
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,720
everything works out.

181
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,320
You just got to be

182
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,200
a little bit less emotional.

183
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,640
Right.

184
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,240
Okay. So, then let's continue

185
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,360
in your journey.

186
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,760
You're seven years in,

187
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,680
and you have hundreds of clients,

188
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,560
what are some of the most

189
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,760
important insights you learned

190
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,160
about marketing and PR

191
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,080
through that experience?

192
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,440
Now you're taking a topic

193
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,480
that can be 10 hours,

194
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,520
and you're asking that one question.

195
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,800
That's what's so smart about this show,

196
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,120
because I get to now skip

197
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
nine hours of studying

198
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,080
for that one sentence

199
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,160
that everybody's looking for.

200
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,000
Now, of course,

201
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,160
there's no magical answer.

202
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,160
No, I have a lot.

203
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,280
I would say that,

204
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,680
I was also like an adviser

205
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
to most of the different accelerators

206
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,880
that you probably know.

207
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,680
And I think,

208
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,720
what I usually told the founders

209
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,560
in terms of early stage marketing

210
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,360
is that you've got to try

211
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,640
and be your own [--].

212
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,240
So, if you're the CEO of the startup

213
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,920
and you start building

214
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
your own reputation,

215
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,800
like you create guest articles

216
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,480
on the big publications.

217
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,640
At some point of time of my life

218
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,080
I was writing for,

219
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,160
like 10 US publications.

220
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,440
Really?

221
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,520
Yeah. Like CNBC, Forbes, Fox news.

222
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,240
So, you might not be able

223
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,920
to do all of that,

224
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,720
but you can definitely work

225
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,520
on a couple of channels

226
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
that will brand you

227
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,560
as like the founder of that company.

228
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:20,880
And then,

229
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,960
when you need to raise your announcement,

230
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,480
like raise seed and all that,

231
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:25,960
you're going to be

232
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,640
already closed to the media.

233
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,720
So you're not gonna need about agencies.

234
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,480
That's actually

235
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,560
a really, really good tip.

236
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,640
I'm going to keep that in mind.

237
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,280
And I think it's you know,

238
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,240
I keep following

239
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,640
the writing that you get and you do,

240
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,400
but also the people that are writing in.

241
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,720
And it always makes me [--]

242
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,240
that I really want to get into that,

243
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,880
because it's not just about

244
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,240
getting your name on those publications,

245
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,760
but it forces you to think critically

246
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,920
about some topics

247
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,880
and to put that thinking into words

248
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,600
that can be meaningful for others.

249
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,560
So, I think that it's

250
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,360
definitely something

251
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,120
that I'm looking forward to.

252
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,080
So, you're writing these publications,

253
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,320
You have that agency

254
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,280
with hundreds of clients,

255
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,000
and what's next on your journey,

256
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,840
on the way to becoming

257
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,960
the CEO of Walnut?

258
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,560
So, you know, I was in New York

259
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,800
for like almost a year

260
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,920
and I just realized that

261
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,360
a marketing company is nice,

262
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,200
but if you don't have 200 employees

263
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,120
and your own building,

264
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,120
that American audience and companies

265
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,000
don't really give a shit.

266
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,120
So, I had to start really encourage me

267
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,080
to start thinking about my next moves.

268
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,800
So, I came back to Israel

269
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,600
and I took some time off.

270
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,200
It was a very long seven years.

271
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,560
I took some time off.

272
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,160
And then we formed the startup

273
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,480
that was designed to save kids

274
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,280
from pedophiles on social media.

275
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,600
Right.

276
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,880
So, it was me

277
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,480
and three more founding members,

278
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,080
[--]

279
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,680
the people probably know.

280
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,040
And after another year of doing that,

281
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
which is a great cause

282
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,120
and I hope they succeed.

283
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Just I felt that it's a perfect time for,

284
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,440
then corona started,

285
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,840
people started switching their mindset.

286
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,760
And I just realized,

287
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,280
that was the perfect time for me

288
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,640
to start my own thing again.

289
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,000
And I'm the founder, co-founder, CEO,

290
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,560
and that was the beginning of Walnut.

291
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,408
So, I want to hold on,

292
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:21,920
on this junction.

293
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,360
Because now you're at a point in time

294
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,600
where you've had an agency,

295
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,440
you have had a very successful business

296
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,000
you grew with your bare hands

297
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,240
in three continents

298
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,760
with dozens of employees and offices.

299
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,680
You've seen what that journey is like

300
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,800
and what selling

301
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
and getting to a good product is like.

302
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,320
Then you're part of the founding team

303
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,360
of a company

304
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,080
that is growing very, very quickly,

305
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,960
raised a lot of money

306
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,440
with a very well-known

307
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,960
and respected CEO with a great cause,

308
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,920
and you're deciding to go back

309
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,160
to the drawing board

310
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,280
and to create a company from scratch,

311
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,760
Walnut.

312
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,760
Was it that you just had

313
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,720
to create something of your own,

314
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,160
like have your own baby?

315
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,040
Was it that you wanted

316
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,760
to really see

317
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,240
what it's like to be that CEO

318
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,760
of a hypergrowth startup?

319
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,200
What was it that really attracted you?

320
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,520
That's an amazing question.

321
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,720
I think it was a combination of,

322
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,520
I think everyone's life

323
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,640
has changed a little bit,

324
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,720
like seven months ago

325
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,520
or eight months ago.

326
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,920
And for me I felt the change,

327
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,680
the main thoughts that I had

328
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,040
while we were quarantined during March,

329
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,360
were that I have to do

330
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
my own thing again.

331
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,240
I have to name it.

332
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,440
I have to decide what the product

333
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,680
is going to do.

334
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,720
And it just felt right.

335
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,319
And I don't really know

336
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,640
how to explain it.

337
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,120
It just felt right.

338
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,200
I just do it like before,

339
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,080
which I've done always.

340
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,640
So, I decided that I'm going to pursue

341
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,360
what I'm feeling.

342
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,560
And everything, kind of like

343
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,480
all of the stars aligned ever since.

344
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,120
It was really starting off

345
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,760
with the right foot.

346
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,080
I have to say that

347
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,960
I'm drawing a parallel

348
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,040
to a lot of the other interviews

349
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,440
that I've had on the show.

350
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,040
Almost every guest

351
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,800
comes with a non-linear career path.

352
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,040
And almost always,

353
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,080
the recurring theme is that

354
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,000
they had this gut feeling

355
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,880
like the one you're describing that says,

356
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,160
Michael, I can't really explain it

357
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,080
in words.

358
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,240
I had to do it.

359
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,960
That it was you know,

360
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,760
they said that entrepreneurs are crazy.

361
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,760
And I think that's part of the insanity.

362
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,080
Right?

363
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,000
Feeling like you have to go

364
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,560
with your heart.

365
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,640
It's a bug.

366
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,720
It's a bug.

367
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,840
Walnut. What's walnut?

368
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,440
Right.

369
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,040
So, I left my previous startup.

370
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,320
And Danni, my co-founder,

371
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,320
who is a brilliant technology guy,

372
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,240
he sold like two startups

373
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,520
and then he oversaw

374
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,473
like 70 something developers

375
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:49,880
that we work.

376
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,320
He kind of was looking for,

377
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,960
we were just kind of imploded.

378
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,520
And he was looking also

379
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,200
to start his next thing.

380
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,880
And we started,

381
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,560
it wasn't a matter of ideation,

382
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,360
which is the process that I hate the most

383
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,840
when you start a new company,

384
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,360
because it's a never ending process.

385
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,120
There's no idea that

386
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,960
[--] every day, all day.

387
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,560
We were both kind of excited

388
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,840
about this whole thing of revolutionizing

389
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,360
how companies present themselves

390
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,160
to other companies.

391
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,360
And we just started building

392
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,000
and [--], and interviewed

393
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,560
60 enterprise companies

394
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,440
and saw what they would

395
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,520
probably pay for if we build.

396
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,680
And everything just started off

397
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,200
like a serious roller coaster since.

398
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,760
So, you mentioned very briefly

399
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,600
the industry of

400
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,080
showing your product to others

401
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,480
or demoing your product.

402
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,800
And when we had a really nice walk

403
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,720
on Ben-Gurion Street,

404
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
you really explained to me

405
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,960
the pain point behind a team's ability

406
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,680
to present their product

407
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,200
to another team, live.

408
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
So, talk to me a little bit

409
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,240
about the space

410
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,720
and why is Walnut so relevant in 2020?

411
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,200
So, 2020 is the year

412
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,360
where everything's done remote, so.

413
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,560
And during the regular times,

414
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,840
let's say, of the previous year,

415
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,520
before corona,

416
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,480
companies always have

417
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,360
like a lot of friction

418
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,760
between the sales team and the back end.

419
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,742
So, the sales team

420
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:19,680
has to ask the designer

421
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,200
to design something,

422
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,400
not to touch the back end

423
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,760
so it doesn't break.

424
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,920
Add a feature into it.

425
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,385
And, you know,

426
00:13:27,585 --> 00:13:30,080
it's like a cross-cultural problem.

427
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,640
I think companies has that problem.

428
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,200
It doesn't matter who you are,

429
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,680
It doesn't matter what's the size.

430
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,600
So, we started building like an editor,

431
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,040
like you would edit a website on WIX,

432
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,400
and it's on our cloud.

433
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,800
So, you edit the sales demo

434
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,040
and it's unbreakable

435
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,000
because it's on a CDM.

436
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,640
And we just started building it.

437
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,080
We showed it to a lot of companies,

438
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,160
everyone wanted to hire us.

439
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,320
And then we raised seed

440
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,200
this takes like a month,

441
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,280
and went from some of the investors

442
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,320
that I consider to be the best around.

443
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,960
And now, we're growing the team,

444
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,040
onboarding clients.

445
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,520
And that's amazing.

446
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,160
So, give me a little bit more insight

447
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,240
into this product

448
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,080
and the actual experience.

449
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,600
So, you mentioned that

450
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,360
one of the interesting solutions

451
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,400
that you've discovered here is that

452
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,920
you can actually

453
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,760
disintegrate the sales team

454
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,360
from the product and back-end team,

455
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,760
such that the sales team

456
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,680
can write their own demos

457
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,160
without having to interface

458
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,480
with the back-end team

459
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,800
and without blocking each other.

460
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,520
So, is this like, you know,

461
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,880
just like a demo where you recorded

462
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,520
and then you show it?

463
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,360
Or is it a live demo

464
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,560
where you can play around with it?

465
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,200
Because obviously,

466
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,360
you want to play around with the demo

467
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,520
live in front of clients.

468
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,320
So, it's not a video

469
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,600
and it's not a screenshot

470
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,400
and it's not a mock up.

471
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,120
It's an actual, touchable,

472
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,360
it's a product that the sales people

473
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,960
had to dive in like

474
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,120
two minutes before the call

475
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,840
and customize.

476
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,120
If we personalize everything,

477
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,680
the only reason that Netflix

478
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,160
beat all the big movie producers

479
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,280
and Hollywood directors is that

480
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,360
because it gives us

481
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,920
a lot of customization.

482
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,600
And we build our [--],

483
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,240
and it's all very reachable.

484
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,480
So, that's a big difference.

485
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,400
When you're selling a product,

486
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,000
it has to be customized

487
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,200
to the client you're showing it to.

488
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,440
And we just gave them that tool.

489
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
And we realized

490
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,800
that there is too much of a demand

491
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,600
than we can handle.

492
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,760
Because we launched and we got like,

493
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,360
almost a thousand companies

494
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,560
to reach out in like a month.

495
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,280
And yeah.

496
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,800
And pretty much,

497
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,880
the most amazing companies

498
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,520
that you can imagine,

499
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,400
I don't want to name them,

500
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,920
but pretty much the biggest

501
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,880
enterprise companies in the world.

502
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,600
Sometimes it was two different teams

503
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,960
from the same company reaching out,

504
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,400
not minding

505
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
the others have reached out.

506
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,960
So, we've proven that there's a problem.

507
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,240
And all of this in how long

508
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,240
since the inception?

509
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,080
Seven months, maybe.

510
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,640
Seven months.

511
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,360
That's unbelievable.

512
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,680
So,

513
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,400
walk me through

514
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,720
the first seven months of, you know,

515
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,080
a fast growing startup,

516
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,520
you're the CEO,

517
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,360
what's bothering you?

518
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,880
Like, what makes you tick

519
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,040
before you go to sleep?

520
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,720
My phone.

521
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:20,640
You know, it's like a never ending,

522
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,240
it's a never ending ordeal.

523
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,840
Yoav, you seem too calm.

524
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,000
You're too relaxed.

525
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,520
Like, I'm nervous for you.

526
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,880
You're growing so fast,

527
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,280
you're onboarding more employees,

528
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,480
you have a thousand companies

529
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,600
waiting in line,

530
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,880
and you're sitting there relaxed

531
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,520
and saying, yes, I'm enjoying it.

532
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,920
Yeah, I had something to drink

533
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,720
before we got on this topic.

534
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,840
I learned that for the next one.

535
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,160
No, if you're pressured,

536
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,120
and if you're relax,

537
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,000
you're going to reach pretty much

538
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,960
the same problem.

539
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,880
So, I have no choice.

540
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,240
But during the day,

541
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,640
like nights like 9PM at night,

542
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,240
during the day,

543
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,680
we're working in a rollercoaster,

544
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,800
like everyone's working their ass off.

545
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,640
And, you know, at nights

546
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,720
we talk to the American companies,

547
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
investors and everyone.

548
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,680
Right.

549
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,640
Yeah. You know, it's a lot of fun.

550
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,040
I think it's the most fun I've had

551
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,160
in all of my career, honestly.

552
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,480
It's so fun and inspiring for me

553
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,720
to be talking to somebody

554
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,680
who's already had a marvelous career

555
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,040
and has impacted

556
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,280
on so many organizations.

557
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,440
And now you're saying that,

558
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,400
that literally now

559
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,480
is the most fun you're having.

560
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,040
That just makes me want to go

561
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,320
and start my own thing already.

562
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,640
What surprised you

563
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,240
over these seven months?

564
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,800
What caught you off guard

565
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,840
that you're like, oh, wow,

566
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,320
I didn't realize this before?

567
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,880
I was afraid

568
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,280
because it was like a crisis

569
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,920
and people were holding on to their jobs.

570
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,720
I was afraid

571
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,960
that it's going to be hard for us

572
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,480
to recruit the talent.

573
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,200
And now it's easier

574
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,640
because we had PR about us

575
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,360
and we raised money.

576
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,320
But before we actually raised the money,

577
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,760
I was really surprised

578
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,240
at how people were loyal

579
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,960
to working

580
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,920
or joining our team

581
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
like our founding team,

582
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,440
even before

583
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,760
there was the first investor in,

584
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,600
even before the first client was in.

585
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,200
And we're very grateful to them.

586
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,520
Some of the best people I know,

587
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,960
they have like 10, 15 years

588
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,320
down the road in the industry.

589
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,760
And I'm really proud

590
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,080
of the team that we've built.

591
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,120
Now, it's going to be harder

592
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,080
because when you've done working

593
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,640
with your first circle

594
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,280
of friends of friends,

595
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,880
you're starting to grow and be,

596
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,560
you know, 10, 15, 20, 30,

597
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,480
and you've got to hire

598
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,680
people you don't know,

599
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,560
your friends don't know,

600
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,440
your colleagues don't know,

601
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,720
and it's getting to be more skeptical

602
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,040
But also, it happened to me too

603
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,560
like two times already before.

604
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,920
So, I hope it'll be fine again.

605
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,280
Right.

606
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,800
And Yoav, usually at this point

607
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,720
of the conversation,

608
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,640
I ask, what is some advice you would give

609
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
to a young entrepreneur like myself

610
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,400
as I am gearing up

611
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,600
towards starting my own.

612
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,520
But what I'm taking away

613
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,160
from this conversation is both, you know,

614
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,800
quit your job, especially if it means

615
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,720
following your heart

616
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,800
and if you're doing something,

617
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,920
because sometimes, not always,

618
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,120
but sometimes the end result

619
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,280
is you're able to say

620
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,440
that you're having the most fun

621
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,920
you ever had in your life

622
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,200
or in your career.

623
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,360
And obviously,

624
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,040
anybody who's looking at the stats

625
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,800
of what you've been doing

626
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,560
the past seven months can see

627
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,680
what an incredible journey

628
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,120
this has been for you.

629
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,440
Especially during a crisis that,

630
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,800
that basically immobilized

631
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,480
most of the startups in the world.

632
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,000
So, I think that's pretty exciting.

633
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,920
Yoav, before we go, though,

634
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,320
I have to ask for three words

635
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,520
that you would use to describe yourself,

636
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,560
or three words that your co-founder

637
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,280
or one of your team members

638
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,080
would use to describe you.

639
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,760
Should have done my homework

640
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,520
and prepare some.

641
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,760
No, no, spontaneous is the key.

642
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,640
Three words,

643
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,920
I

644
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,360
would say emotional.

645
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,080
I didn't expect that.

646
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,320
Not in my personal life,

647
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,560
but when building a startup,

648
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,560
I'm very emotional

649
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,520
which is not good.

650
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,000
I think my team members

651
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,240
would use a name to describe me,

652
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,600
that's someone that's

653
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,280
making it complicated to order lunch.

654
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,080
Undeciding.

655
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,760
And also a little bit being late

656
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,000
to places all the time.

657
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,480
But besides that,

658
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,960
I think I'm a really decent guy.

659
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,000
Yoav, you definitely are.

660
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,600
And I very much appreciate

661
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,240
our friendship,

662
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,400
and I learn a lot from you.

663
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,720
So, thank you for both

664
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,640
giving the time to do this show

665
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
and for teaching me

666
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,240
throughout the journey.

667
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,400
And it's been a lot of fun

668
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:44,880
following you,

669
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,160
and I can't wait to follow Walnut

670
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,800
and the things you're doing.

671
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,600
And other than that,

672
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,320
I just have to wish you

673
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,040
to stay safe and stay healthy.

674
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,080
Likewise.

675
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,280
And then good luck with your book.

676
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,200
Everyone going to buy it.

677
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,040
That's awesome.

678
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,720
Thank you, Yoav.

679
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,400
Take care.

680
00:20:59,400 --> 00:20:59,800
Bye bye.
