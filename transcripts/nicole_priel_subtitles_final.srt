140
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,400
Nicole Priel, thank you so much

141
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,960
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

142
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,760
Thank you.

143
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
It's an honor to be here.

144
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,920
So great to have you.

145
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,600
I'm really excited

146
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,800
to do the show with you.

147
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,760
And I'm especially excited

148
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,960
to hear about your journey.

149
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,600
How you got into VC?

150
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,880
What does this mean to you?

151
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,440
There are a few stories

152
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,400
that I'm especially excited

153
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:12,800
to hear about

154
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,200
but let's just get started.

155
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,400
Nicole, tell me who you are

156
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,440
and why are you in venture capital?

157
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,400
Yes. So, I'm Nicole.

158
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,520
I grew up in London, Maryland, and New York.

159
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,240
And growing up in New York,

160
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,920
you start growing up really fast.

161
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,160
So, at the age of 16, while most of friends

162
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,840
were of being camp counselors

163
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,600
and whatnot,

164
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,680
I was working on the floor

165
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,240
of the New York Mercantile Exchange,

166
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,480
the commodities floor working for

167
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,160
natural gas and oil traders.

168
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,040
And that really propelled my career

169
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,360
into the world of investments.

170
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,360
So I went from there to a hedge fund

171
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,840
that was also trading oil and gas options.

172
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,000
Then when I went to university -

173
00:05:52,005 --> 00:05:53,610
I have a question Nicole.

174
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,520
Why at 16 are you doing this?

175
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,600
Who at 16 goes and does this?

176
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,440
I realized that,

177
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,880
you know, you have to give it your all.

178
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
And if you really wanna get ahead in life,

179
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,840
you need to put

180
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,680
your best foot forward.

181
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,440
So, it was beginning

182
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,720
of experiential learning.

183
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,480
This whole concept

184
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,560
of learning outside the classroom.

185
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,240
And I wanted to build my resumé.

186
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,080
And position myself well career wise.

187
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,520
So, I was thinking already about

188
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,160
college and post college.

189
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,360
And I figured, all right,

190
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,240
I've done the camp thing

191
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,520
now it's time to move on.

192
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,560
Wow. Okay.

193
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,000
So, you're doing all these

194
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,880
sorts of internships.

195
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,600
What else have you done

196
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,440
leading up to college

197
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,840
and through college?

198
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,120
Not much else.

199
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,040
I was quite boring.

200
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,160
I volunteered a lot in New York.

201
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,000
I was pretty active

202
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,960
as a high school student at the time.

203
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,880
Israel was actually

204
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,400
in a tough spot with the second intifada,

205
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,520
so I was pretty active going to protests

206
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,880
and demonstrations and things like that.

207
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,760
Yes so it was a busy time.

208
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,680
I started the Zionist Action Committee

209
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,480
in high school.

210
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,960
And then I went up to Boston in 2005

211
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,000
for university.

212
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,080
And I continued on

213
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,400
doing interesting things.

214
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,640
I studied abroad at Hebrew U

215
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,920
when I was 19,

216
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:14,520
my junior year.

217
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,320
And that's where

218
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,080
I actually met my husband, by the way.

219
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,160
So, I fell in love at the age of 19.

220
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,640
Wow.

221
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,280
And set me up for the rest of my life.

222
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,600
But I came back to university

223
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,240
I came back to Boston in 2007, 2008

224
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,320
and I had basically

225
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,080
been exposed to this whole startup

226
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,400
Tech ecosystem in Israel

227
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,800
which was really nascent in the US

228
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,960
especially on the East Coast.

229
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,880
It wasn't really the thing it is today.

230
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,800
But I was really interested

231
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,760
in learning more about it.

232
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,200
So I discovered, lo and behold,

233
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,840
that Boston is a Mecca for VC.

234
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,680
So, I just shot off,

235
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,800
something like 24 cold emails

236
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,000
to all the VCs in Boston

237
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,400
and I said,

238
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,840
"Hey, I'm a student.

239
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,880
I wanna work for you.

240
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
I wanna get experience.

241
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,600
I'm happy to volunteer my time."

242
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,720
Two got back to me.

243
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,880
One said "We'd love to have you

244
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,840
but we literally don't have the space."

245
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,440
And the other said,

246
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,280
"You know what?

247
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,080
We're actually going through a rebranding

248
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,640
and we would love to have

249
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,760
a college student on board to help us do that."

250
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,000
So, that was

251
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,475
Flybridge Capital Partners

252
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,680
took a chance on me

253
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,360
and it was a great experience. So I -

254
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,600
24 cold emails.

255
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,770
Yeah.

256
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:25,780
Yeah.

257
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,560
I mean, at the end you're looking

258
00:08:26,565 --> 00:08:27,570
and then you say

259
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:29,840
Okay. Not many college students

260
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,280
have an opportunity to work

261
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,160
for VC at that point.

262
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,120
And you could look at it

263
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,920
in the sense of,

264
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,640
Yeah, I got a position,

265
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,200
but then the backstory of there were

266
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,720
23 other cold e-mails that

267
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,000
either went unanswered

268
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,400
or were rejected.

269
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,200
It puts things in perspective on how much

270
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,040
you have to sometimes

271
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
just shoot for the moon

272
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,640
and hopefully something comes up.

273
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,000
So, talk to me a little bit about

274
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,320
your experience in that VC

275
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,480
and what were you doing there?

276
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,520
So, it was great.

277
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,120
I set up their social media pages.

278
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,000
I created their LinkedIn page.

279
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,480
They were undergoing a rebranding

280
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,280
so I was helping with a lot

281
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,560
of marketing efforts.

282
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,280
I sat in on pitch meetings

283
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,880
with brilliant entrepreneurs.

284
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,480
And I even did some due diligence.

285
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,240
There was an interesting company

286
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,040
that came through.

287
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,040
Two former executives

288
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,640
from Scott Toilet Paper

289
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,520
had an idea for a fertilizer company.

290
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,440
So I rented a car,

291
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,560
the only car they had on lot

292
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,600
was this red Dodge Charger

293
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,000
that looked like a sports car

294
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,600
but it's also used

295
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,440
as an undercover police car.

296
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,640
And I drove that down to New York

297
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,080
and I visited all these

298
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,640
home and gardening shops,

299
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,040
places like Home Depot.

300
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,560
And I was inspecting all the different

301
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,720
fertilizers and speaking to salespeople

302
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,760
and customers about their

303
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,400
fertilizer options.

304
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,640
So, that was really, really fun.

305
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,200
And it set me up well to do

306
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,360
VC post university.

307
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,280
So okay so you're finishing university

308
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,600
and you decide you want

309
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,280
to continue doing the VC life.

310
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,160
So, what happens next?

311
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,960
Yeah so actually, I graduated in 2008.

312
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,760
I don't know if you know

313
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,040
what was going on in 2008

314
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,160
but it was not a good time

315
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,400
to graduate university.

316
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,000
Much like today, it's not a good time

317
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,240
to graduate college in 2020.

318
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,360
So, I got a job at Exxon Mobil

319
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,920
'cause while the markets were down,

320
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,840
oil was sky high.

321
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,720
It was at $140 a barrel.

322
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,560
So, things were moving there.

323
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,640
That's a little different than

324
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,560
the free barrels we had the other day.

325
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,640
Yeah, yeah.

326
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,880
Crazy how fast things change.

327
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,400
And by the way, that's why so many energy

328
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,520
oil and gas traders blow up.

329
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,160
They just you can have a good year

330
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,040
and then you can have a bad year and
be totally wiped out.

331
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,920
So volatile. Yeah.

332
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,400
Yeah. So, I went to work for Exxon Mobil

333
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,160
in a management training

334
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,320
program for two years.

335
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,040
And from there, I moved to Israel

336
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,120
and rejoined the investment world.

337
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,040
Wow. Okay.

338
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,160
So, investments.

339
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,200
At the end of the day,

340
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,880
obviously, I mean,

341
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,040
it's fun, it's luxurious,

342
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,600
you get to meet a lot of entrepreneurs,

343
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,160
but why choose the investment route?

344
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,680
You know, I get to experience

345
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,040
some of this VC world here in the

346
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,280
early stage fund J-Ventures.

347
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,560
And it's so, so exciting,

348
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,040
but I can see both sides to it.

349
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,800
So, why are you so attracted to this world?

350
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,280
You know, I'm gonna tell you

351
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,200
half joking, half serious,

352
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,960
I'm in love with babies.

353
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,320
Since I was a young girl,

354
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,680
I was obsessed with babies.

355
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,160
There's something that's

356
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,800
so cute about them.

357
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,360
And I've always been a huge fan.

358
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,320
Once they're one, not so interesting.

359
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,760
I let my husband take care of them.

360
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,040
Give me them for the first year

361
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,920
and then they're all yours.

362
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,520
So, startups for me

363
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,440
are like babies.

364
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,240
They're honestly like

365
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,960
babies. My youngest

366
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:36,920
now is one.

367
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,640
So, she's in that not cute category and -

368
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,320
I heard that it's the terrible

369
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,240
twos that count.

370
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,200
I didn't hear about,

371
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,160
I thought you have two cute years.

372
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:47,720
I guess not.

373
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,280
Not in my book.

374
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,720
But when you're helping companies

375
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,640
from their very earliest stages.

376
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,040
From their inception, grow.

377
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,200
You pick them up when they cry.

378
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,320
You show them the way.

379
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,640
You hold their hand.

380
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,560
You give them advice.

381
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,680
You open doors for them,

382
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,160
literally and figuratively.

383
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,360
It's very similar to helping nurture

384
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,760
small babies.

385
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,240
So, I love cute babies.

386
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,560
I love exciting startups

387
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,320
and it really gets me going

388
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
waking up every morning

389
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,360
and thinking about

390
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,200
how can we help grow

391
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,080
this business today?

392
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,200
Or who is the next exciting entrepreneur

393
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,080
or company to come out of Israel?

394
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,360
So how many deals

395
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,080
would you'd you say you've been

396
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,400
a part of over the years

397
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,800
and over your experiences?

398
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
How many entrepreneurs have

399
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,960
you had a chance to deal with?

400
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,880
So, I have been working

401
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,680
in the investment field for

402
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,760
over 10 years now,

403
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,680
and I've seen a lot of different stages.

404
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,240
Late stage public equities.

405
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,640
Pre IPO growth companies.

406
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,440
Early stage.

407
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,120
And at IBEX,

408
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,640
we also, we invest across all those stages.

409
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,880
Over the years, we invested in

410
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,120
23 Israeli companies since 2012.

411
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,240
We've had seven exits.

412
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,720
So, really stellar returns.

413
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,240
Wow.

414
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,640
And we're actually

415
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,000
doubling down on Israel.

416
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,040
And just yesterday we closed

417
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,680
our second Israel fund.

418
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,760
Wow. Congratulations.

419
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,800
Thank you. Thank you.

420
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,680
We're really excited to double down.

421
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,520
That's amazing.

422
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,880
So, you're Vice President

423
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,240
at IBEX Investors.

424
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,760
What is this group

425
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,640
and what is sort of the thesis

426
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,600
that you guys go with?

427
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,000
So, believe it or not, back in 2011,

428
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,560
the founder of IBEX,

429
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,120
this guy from Denver, reads

430
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,840
the Startup Nation book,

431
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,720
gets on a plane, comes to Israel.

432
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,720
Does a little trip here.

433
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,080
Gets back to Denver and says,

434
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,120
"Wow, we've got to do something in Israel.

435
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,120
The innovation there is out of control."

436
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,080
So, they started with a really small fund.

437
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,080
Today, it's multiples of that.

438
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,680
And they just start investing

439
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,280
in public and private Israeli companies.

440
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,080
And we have the name, IBEX.

441
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,960
A lot of people don't know

442
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,960
what IBEX are,

443
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,280
especially Israelis which is ironic.

444
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,283
But if you're familiar with Yael

445
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:10,450
the animal.
- Animal?

446
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,320
Yes. Yes.

447
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,920
Of course.

448
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:13,800
The animal down south

449
00:14:13,805 --> 00:14:14,970
around ...

450
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,880
That is able to to climb almost

451
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,440
90-degree angles.

452
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,360
Something amazing on the hills.

453
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,760
There you go.

454
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,000
So, most Israelis don't know that.

455
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,160
They're like, "What's IBEX?"

456
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,320
Then we say, "Yael."

457
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,320
And they're like, "Oh okay. Cool."

458
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,880
So why, but what is it about the animal

459
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,240
that's exciting and that reminds of

460
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,600
the entrepreneurial spirit perhaps?

461
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,960
The founder of IBEX likes to joke that

462
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,800
we didn't name our fund IBEX

463
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,400
because it's an exotic, elegant animal

464
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:50,120
who's able to scale difficult terrain.

465
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,160
We named it IBEX because

466
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,400
it was the first name

467
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,800
of Freddie Mercury's band.

468
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,960
Joke. Joking. Joking. Jokes aside.

469
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,880
Okay. Amazing.

470
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,600
So, how many people are part of this group?

471
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,040
We're 21 people

472
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,680
with offices in Denver, New York

473
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,280
and Tel Aviv.

474
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,760
Incredible. And so, you meet

475
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,680
So, is your position in Israel

476
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,560
do you just meet all sorts of

477
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,560
interesting startups

478
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,880
from all sorts of stages

479
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,320
and then bring it back to the group

480
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
and decide together

481
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,640
whether to invest or not?

482
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,000
How does a committee actually work?

483
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,720
Yeah, that's basically it.

484
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,360
So, I meet lots of companies.

485
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,800
Nowadays, it’s mainly on zoom

486
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,960
and that's cool.

487
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,440
But we can move really fast.

488
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,240
We meet companies.

489
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,960
We conduct some due diligence.

490
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,240
We do have an investment committee

491
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,560
where we decide if this is a go or no go.

492
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,960
With the last investment we made,

493
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:49,680
we met the company

494
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,080
just before covid broke out

495
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,920
or as covid was breaking out

496
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:53,280
in the world.

497
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,520
And we did the deal on lockdown.

498
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,880
So, we move very fast. From the

499
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,040
first meeting 'til the term sheet

500
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,400
it was 10 days.

501
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,040
So, despite the miles between

502
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,200
myself and my partners in Denver,

503
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,280
we move pretty quickly.

504
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,000
No I think it's actually it's interesting.

505
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,040
And quite a few people have been

506
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,280
telling me that a lot of these things

507
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,200
have been accelerated due to Covid

508
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,280
because now if people were waiting

509
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,640
for a physical meeting in the office,

510
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,560
a lot of the times they said,

511
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,240
"Okay. We don't have to wait next week

512
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,240
until we're all in the same location.

513
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,040
We can just do it tonight over Zoom

514
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,240
and get things rolling."

515
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,200
So, I've actually been hearing this

516
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,320
quite a lot.

517
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,360
But, you know, I'd love

518
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,120
to hear your perspective.

519
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,880
So you've been observing

520
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,680
the Israeli ecosystem for the past

521
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,560
10 years, I'm assuming. Right?

522
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,760
And I'd love to get your insight

523
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,240
into what have you observed

524
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,240
about the Israeli ecosystem, perhaps

525
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,560
in comparison to other ecosystems?

526
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,720
And I mean, I'm asking for myself

527
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,480
because I don't know enough yet

528
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,120
and it's fascinating to me.

529
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,760
Yeah, it's a really good question.

530
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,880
I did not spend time in Silicon Valley,

531
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:06,070
but what I can observe from Israel

532
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,280
is that the ecosystem here

533
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,030
is incredibly collaborative.

534
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,480
Everyone really lends a helping hand

535
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,240
to everybody else.

536
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,280
So, you don't have those competitive,

537
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,160
stealthy maneuvers

538
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,680
where people are trying to outbid

539
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,750
or outmaneuver someone else.

540
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,160
So, it's very collaborative.

541
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,320
Very open forum for discussion

542
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,400
with other funds.

543
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,240
We share deal flow.

544
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,480
We share ideas.

545
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,000
Founders are always willing to

546
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,200
help younger founders and mentor them.

547
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,510
Why do you think that is?

548
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,800
What is it about, why does the Israeli ecosystem have

549
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,880
this collaborative nature?

550
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,560
I mean obviously I love Israelis.

551
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,520
I'm Israeli myself.

552
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,270
And it shows on the street and on the beach,

553
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,830
but I would imagine that when it comes to

554
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,240
venture capital, to entrepreneurship,

555
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,400
I mean, there's only so many good deals

556
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,590
out there and there's a lot of VCs

557
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,400
who are looking for them.

558
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,310
It's David and Goliath.

559
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,040
We're a country the size of New Jersey

560
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,160
that's mainly made up of sand

561
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,550
trying to break into the big old

562
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,920
United States of America

563
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,520
where there's tons of capital throwing.

564
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,280
Tons of tons of interesting people

565
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,350
and startups that are coming out.

566
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,080
And we need to

567
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,240
literally cross mountains

568
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,720
and oceans to get there.

569
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,560
So, whatever we can do

570
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,080
to help each other succeed

571
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,550
Like someone else's success is my success

572
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,550
and likewise.

573
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,240
So, I think we're up against

574
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,880
a great challenge and we need

575
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,000
everybody's participation

576
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,720
and cooperation to surmount that.

577
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,440
And is your decision to focus primarily

578
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,400
your efforts on the Israeli ecosystem,

579
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,920
is that out of any professional strategy?

580
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,240
Or is that mainly your love for the country

581
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,160
and the fact that you made

582
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,440
aliyah for that?

583
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,480
It's a mixture of both.

584
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,440
So, we have ... fiduciary duty.

585
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,200
We return capital to our investors.

586
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,030
Israel's a great place to deploy capital

587
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,440
and to be able to get those returns,

588
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,440
those venture style returns

589
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,000
that we're looking for.

590
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,800
Personally and professionally,

591
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,840
it also obviously strikes a chord

592
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,320
in my heart to be a part of it

593
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,690
and to help that.

594
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,960
So, given that you've been

595
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,720
practically a Zionist

596
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,560
since high school

597
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,800
and leading these efforts.

598
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,510
I mean, it definitely shows.

599
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,680
Talk to me a little bit about

600
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,000
some of the things that you've observed

601
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,600
with the young entrepreneurs

602
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,880
versus maybe serial entrepreneurs.

603
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,640
That's always a fascinating topic for me.

604
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,440
What does it mean to,

605
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:36,880
you know a lot of people

606
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,640
give so much credit

607
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,560
to serial entrepreneurs

608
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,480
because they've gone through

609
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,640
different things.

610
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,110
What have you been observing

611
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,400
and what type of entrepreneur are

612
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,960
you most excited to work with?

613
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,310
So maybe this is a bit unconventional,

614
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,790
but serial entrepreneurs, they're great.

615
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,070
And yes, they have the experience.

616
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,160
They've been through the whole cycle.

617
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,240
They know the ups and downs.

618
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:57,720
And when they come up to bat

619
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,830
to do it again,

620
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,400
it says a certain thing about that person

621
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,200
that they know how tough

622
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,280
and grueling it is

623
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,400
and they're willing to do it again.

624
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,790
And that's phenomenal.

625
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,880
But when we look for invest,

626
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,750
when we look for founders to back,

627
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,550
we're actually looking for the ones

628
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,310
who don't have that experience.

629
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,840
Who have a chip on their shoulder.

630
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,830
Who feel like they have something to move

631
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,400
and they're determined to make it big.

632
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,600
Wow. So, you're actually

633
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,040
on some way preferring

634
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,720
a first-time entrepreneur

635
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,480
rather than a serial.

636
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,310
Obviously, every deal on its own,

637
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,080
but overall, you're more excited

638
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,440
about these first-time entrepreneurs.

639
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,000
Yes.

640
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,320
I've never heard that before.

641
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,640
Amazing. Okay.

642
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,110
And, you know,

643
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,120
But with the chip on the shoulder

644
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,440
comes the lack of facing the

645
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,720
adversities and the lack of experience.

646
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,600
And so, you are foregoing

647
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,960
all that experience for the passion,

648
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,440
the motivation and that

649
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,480
initial excitement.

650
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,400
Yeah, that's true.

651
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,720
So, it means there is a little bit

652
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,830
more handholding.

653
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,550
And we learn from our mistakes.

654
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:00,080
We learn from our mistakes.

655
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,240
But we are prepared

656
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,160
to roll our sleeves up

657
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,510
and help them out.

658
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,680
And I think that they also

659
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,830
have a lot to teach us.

660
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,000
So, we're happy to give them the chance.

661
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,550
We're not stubborn about,

662
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,400
second timers.

663
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,240
Right. So, I mean,

664
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,200
and also this idea of being

665
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,480
an active investor versus

666
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,520
a passive investor

667
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,920
and sometimes holding hands

668
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,960
and being there for them.

669
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,120
How much of that meeting

670
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,000
alignment of expectations is there

671
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,040
before you go into a collaboration

672
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,310
with an entrepreneur?

673
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,240
Or how much understanding is there between

674
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,440
the two parties on how much or how intensive

675
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,590
this relationship is going to be?

676
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,160
Because it can go all ways, right?

677
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,400
Totally. Totally.

678
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,960
And you never know until you jump in.

679
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,000
It's a massive leap of faith.

680
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,960
Massive.

681
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,520
And that's why so much of it comes down

682
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,440
to the team and the chemistry between

683
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,440
the investor and the founders

684
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,070
because you're literally spending

685
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,760
day in and day out with each other for

686
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,550
five, 10, maybe 15 years even.

687
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,280
So, all those expectations should come up

688
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,920
in the beginning with the understanding

689
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,800
that things can change

690
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,400
and things will change.

691
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,350
So, gotta just hope for the best.

692
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,360
And is that something that you can

693
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,080
reasonably aim to really understand within

694
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,880
a matter of 10 days due diligence?

695
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,880
I mean, that's very fast

696
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,440
for the responsibility of aligning

697
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,360
expectations and realizing if this

698
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,760
is gonna be a good relationship.

699
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,560
Yeah, well 10 days actually sounds

700
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,960
like a lot. When you think about it,

701
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,480
you develop like an intuition

702
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,920
and a gut instinct within the first

703
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,000
10 minutes of meeting someone.

704
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,040
So you know pretty much

705
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,520
from the outset whether this is something

706
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,070
that could potentially work or not.

707
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,240
So, compare that to the next

708
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,640
10 days of due diligence.

709
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,680
It's the 80-20 rule.

710
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,000
So yeah, sure I could spend three months,

711
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,240
speaking to every person

712
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,720
who's ever encountered the founders,

713
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,280
but is that really going to make

714
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,520
a difference in terms of our decision?

715
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,550
Probably not.

716
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,120
Right and I think one thing that I've been observing

717
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,520
is that more and more funds are taking

718
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:03,040
ownership over this fast, this quick

719
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,800
decision making. NFX famously did

720
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,440
that over covid and Fusion Labs in L.A.

721
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,520
also, three weeks until a deal.

722
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,350
I think 10 days is extraordinary.

723
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,760
But it sounds like also this is a greater

724
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,560
incentive now for entrepreneurs as well

725
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:22,120
to trust the VC.

726
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,240
And do you think that is because

727
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,840
there are more VCs now looking

728
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:27,640
for the great talent,

729
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,830
which is scarce

730
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,240
and it needs to be more attractive?

731
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,960
Or is that really because the VC wants

732
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,920
to be more efficient and see

733
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,200
more deals throughout the year?

734
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,840
Is it the chicken or the egg?

735
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,840
I don't know if I'll ever answer

736
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,400
that question sufficiently.

737
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,550
Definitely.

738
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,880
You're right that there's more

739
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,070
and more companies today,

740
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,760
not necessarily

741
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,040
all of them are venture appropriate.

742
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,640
There's this misconception, I think,

743
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,280
that if you want to start a company

744
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,760
that you need to go out and take venture.

745
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,040
And I feel very strongly that venture capital

746
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,400
is not the model for most

747
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,680
businesses out there.

748
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,760
So, there's alternatives

749
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,830
and entrepreneurs need to keep that in mind

750
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,560
that venture capital is not

751
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,350
the mold for everyone

752
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,560
and for every type of business.

753
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,600
So, they shouldn't really necessarily spend

754
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:19,160
a lot of time chasing venture capitalists

755
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,640
if it's not appropriate for them,

756
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,400
and they can speak to a couple people

757
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,720
and verify that pretty quickly, I think.

758
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,680
And depending on the VC,

759
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,160
Yeah, efficiency is key.

760
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,080
We're looking to do three

761
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,000
to four investments a year.

762
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:35,080
So, we obviously have,

763
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,000
there's a lot of deal flow in the pipeline

764
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,640
and when we meet the ones

765
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,080
who we want to work with,

766
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,350
we can move very quickly.

767
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,480
Right. It's fascinating to me

768
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,590
this work that you,

769
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,760
you spend so much time

770
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,960
meeting so many people. At the end,

771
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,280
what it comes down to

772
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,600
are these few key investments

773
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,350
that you make on a yearly basis.

774
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,280
And when you say 4 investments a year

775
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,440
it doesn't necessarily sound like a lot,

776
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,200
but when you put it in the context of

777
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,240
seeing hundreds of companies

778
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,520
and going through that,

779
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,600
going through that filter,

780
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,160
which has to be really, really precise

781
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,000
because at the end,

782
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,520
this is the fiduciary responsibility

783
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,280
you have towards your other investors.

784
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,160
I think it's just an incredible journey.

785
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,600
Nicole, right before we leave, I have

786
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,350
to ask you the most important question.

787
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,280
Three words that describe you.

788
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,160
Oh my God. Wow.
The first things that come to mind.

789
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,680
This is not a huge commitment.

790
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,350
All right.

791
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,040
I always live by the mantra:

792
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,640
You never know.

793
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,280
You never know.

794
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,600
Explain that. Explain that to me.

795
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,160
So many people are afraid to take a leap,

796
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,960
afraid to make a change,

797
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,920
unsure of what's to come.

798
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,720
And I say, "Hey, you really never

799
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,110
know what's gonna be.

800
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,200
This could turn out to be the best

801
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,120
decision of your life"

802
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,040
Or you think that you're gonna do X,

803
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,830
but it's gonna turn out to be Y.

804
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,520
So, nothing is certain.

805
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,880
And just listen to the

806
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,480
New York Lottery

807
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
that was their motto.

808
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,830
You never know.

809
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,640
I think it's awesome.

810
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,840
And I think it's probably one

811
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,920
of the best mindsets you can go in

812
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,600
to the industry that we're living in

813
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,520
because you just never know.

814
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,440
And every day I'm surprised by something

815
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,590
new that's happening.

816
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,720
And I think that's just what makes it

817
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,360
so exciting.

818
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,790
It's the unpredictability,

819
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,040
and it's the fact that literally

820
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,400
anything is possible

821
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,520
and you never know.

822
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,320
Nicole toda raba.

823
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,880
Thank you very, very much.

824
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,960
Thank you for your time.

825
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,040
Thank you for your generosity

826
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,440
and have a fantastic day.

827
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,880
Thank you.

828
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,640
It was a pleasure speaking with you.

829
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,720
Take care.

830
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,360
Bye bye.
