00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,960
Orit Balicer Tsur,

2
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,000
thank you so much for joining me.

3
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,480
How are you?

4
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,120
Good, how are you?

5
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,840
Fantastic. It's 9:00 p.m.

6
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,760
It's after Shabbat dinner where you're at.

7
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,480
So first of all, thank you

8
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,160
for taking the time to do this so late.

9
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,420
And what you mentioned was that

10
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,440
this is the reality

11
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,800
of living between continents, right?

12
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,840
That's right, yeah.

13
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,760
I'm used to it by now.

14
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,760
Definitely. So, architect by profession,

15
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,880
then turning into

16
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,080
a product manager at Lyft.

17
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,080
Serial entrepreneur

18
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,280
with an acquisition behind you.

19
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,320
And now running a startup at stealth mode.

20
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,280
And while you can't share

21
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,880
too much about it,

22
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
I'd love to hear a little bit

23
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,640
about the insights that led you

24
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,760
towards this new endeavor.

25
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,960
But Orit, take me back

26
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,200
all the way to Bezalel.

27
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,720
Take me back

28
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,480
to your architecture days.

29
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,520
Like what was architecture all about,

30
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,640
because if you're looking

31
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,840
at your track record today,

32
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,440
it seems so bizarre to be on your resume.

33
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,040
Yeah, I know. It's really not

34
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,280
the usual way to do it.

35
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,560
Most of the product managers

36
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,720
or entrepreneurs come

37
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,640
from a different background,

38
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,760
but I wanted to be an architect

39
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,320
since I was, I think, 10.

40
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,040
My best friend's grandfather

41
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,200
was a very good architect

42
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,280
and I saw his work and I was,

43
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,680
"Okay. This is the profession

44
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,480
that I want to choose for myself

45
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,480
when I grow up."

46
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,480
What was it about architecture? Why?

47
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,000
I think one thing

48
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,200
was about creation, creativity.

49
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,200
The way that you just invent things

50
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,120
and then people use them.

51
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,440
And I think there was something holistic

52
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,680
about architecture.

53
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,240
It was a little bit of math,

54
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,160
a little bit of art,

55
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,720
a little bit of psychology.

56
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,000
And you just had everything in it

57
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,240
and it was very appealing to me.

58
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,160
And there was the thing about

59
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,600
it was a profession that had a name.

60
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,800
It was, what are you? I'm an architect.

61
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,760
It's very, it's ...

62
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,680
You can explain it.

63
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,400
You can understand,

64
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,360
you can grasp ...

65
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
when you are a kid

66
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,840
and when you are a grown up too.

67
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,880
Something that is easily explained

68
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,840
to your grandmother.

69
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,080
Much more difficult when you're running

70
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,040
a stealth startup, right?

71
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,000
Exactly. Exactly.

72
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,240
What is it exactly that you are doing.

73
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,080
I'm not sure if,

74
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,720
I mean, my parents know what I'm doing,

75
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,360
but they're not really

76
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,340
... understand fully what I'm doing

77
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,000
how my day to day look like.

78
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,600
And so, I went ahead

79
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,680
and I studied architecture

80
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,040
in Bezalel Jerusalem, Israel.

81
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,200
And I became an architect.

82
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,120
And I loved it.

83
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,920
If you would ask me

84
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,920
during my years at Bezalel

85
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,760
if I would ever change profession,

86
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,360
I would tell you,

87
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,080
"Hell no. No way."

88
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,000
I will be an architect.

89
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,400
That's the best profession in the world.

90
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,800
I still think that.

91
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,040
I mean, definitely in terms of,

92
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,880
what is architecture, the essence of it,

93
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,000
it's the most beautiful profession

94
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,680
in the whole world.

95
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,640
It's a little bit different, I think,

96
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,000
the day to day.

97
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,360
I mean, dealing with contractors

98
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,840
is not exactly what you were thinking about

99
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,320
when you were studying.

100
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,720
But still, a beautiful thing to do.

101
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,040
And what happened, eventually, was that

102
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,160
I was working as an architect

103
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,640
and I was teaching at Bezalel

104
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,600
after I graduated,

105
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,120
but I had this opportunity

106
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,960
to come and work for a startup

107
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,720
first one when I was still a student

108
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,840
I was employee number six in Kaltura,

109
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,600
which was, still is, an amazing company.

110
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,960
And it all started back then.

111
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,380
We were working from,

112
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,520
I would say the garage.

113
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,000
The garage was very nice.

114
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,240
Very well ...

115
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,920
But still, it's like it was building it

116
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,040
from the essentials

117
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,640
and it was an amazing experience.

118
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,000
And then when I was only an architect,

119
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,920
I had all these chances to go

120
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,520
and be a consultant to different startups.

121
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:12,880
And I said,

122
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,520
"Yeah, I like it."

123
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,080
I mean, I like doing it

124
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,880
so I'll do it after hours.

125
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,040
So I had a day job

126
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,400
and then a night job as a consultant.

127
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,200
One of the companies that I worked for

128
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,840
was Soluto, which back then had a product

129
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,760
that was built for,

130
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,800
I think almost two years,

131
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,120
and no even one user

132
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,960
saw the product back then.

133
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,800
Wow.

134
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
It sounds crazy today,

135
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,440
but the days were before the lean startup.

136
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,640
It wasn't so obvious

137
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,880
that you have to meet the users

138
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,120
in order to build a good product.

139
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,920
And so there was a great technology,

140
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,800
amazing team.

141
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,320
And I joined to start running

142
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,920
the alpha, the beta, and go out.

143
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,160
We went to TechCrunch Disrupt

144
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,360
and we won the first prize

145
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,400
at TechCrunch Disrupt.

146
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,720
At Soluto, I started as a consultant,

147
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
but what happened was that

148
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,880
the CEO asked me to stay a little longer

149
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,180
and be head of marketing, and I said,

150
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,920
"Okay. I will do that

151
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,880
for a couple of years

152
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,840
and then I'll go back

153
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,560
and be an architect."

154
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,080
Of course.

155
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,180
Unbelievable.
- And I'm still waiting.

156
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,520
No, I do have to say Orit,

157
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,280
because, the way that I'm thinking about

158
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,120
the architecture scene

159
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,240
and I'm thinking about the startup scene.

160
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,400
The startup scene is all about agile

161
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,360
and about trying new things.

162
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,160
And maybe back then,

163
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,760
back in the day in Kaltura and Soluto,

164
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,360
we still didn't have

165
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,880
the lean startup methodology

166
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,120
and it wasn't about move fast

167
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,640
and break things.

168
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,960
But today, it's very evident

169
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,160
that when you're running a startup,

170
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,400
and I'm sure that when you were running

171
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,360
your product at Lyft,

172
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,640
which we'll talk about very soon,

173
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,240
it's all about trying very quickly

174
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,040
things getting a lot of market validation.

175
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,160
When you're an architect,

176
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,560
when you're building an office space

177
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,720
or you're building a building,

178
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,960
it's like the most waterfall thing

179
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,880
you can do, right?

180
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,160
You lay out all the plans

181
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,920
and then you're committing

182
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,480
to a three year project

183
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,000
when, God forbid, something changes

184
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,680
I'm just assuming.

185
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,680
So, it's interesting

186
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,600
how you're relating the two things,

187
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,000
but you're not focusing

188
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,760
on the difference between them,

189
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,560
you're focusing on the beauty

190
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,560
behind each industry.

191
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,840
Definitely, and I think

192
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,000
Well, you said three years.

193
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,080
I think that's true in the States,

194
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,100
but in Israel, I think you are not

195
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,080
...

196
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,320
It's amazing.

197
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,480
I think one of the reasons why I went

198
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,960
and wanted to be an architect

199
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,480
was this notion of

200
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,600
thinking about something,

201
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,320
making it realized,

202
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
and then it's going to be there after you.

203
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,560
And that was an amazing thing

204
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,680
to think about, for me.

205
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,480
And with startups,

206
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,920
it's not exactly the same thing;

207
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,420
it's not going to be there after you.

208
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,680
It's, as you said,

209
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,080
like a very short cycle.

210
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,600
You're building something,

211
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,760
five years from now,

212
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,080
what you build is no longer

213
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,680
going to be there.

214
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,760
You have to keep reinventing everything.

215
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,720
But that has beauty of its own

216
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,000
in a way.

217
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,320
So I think architecture

218
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,480
and entrepreneurship and product,

219
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,920
it's very similar in the way

220
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,320
you think about

221
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,560
I have a concept,

222
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,800
I have an idea of how I'm going to make

223
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,960
people's life better.

224
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,080
And then I'm going to account

225
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,760
everything that I have to take

226
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,080
from all sides.

227
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,880
From financials

228
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,000
and from behavioral aspects

229
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and delightfulness

230
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,040
and all sorts ... you think about.

231
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,800
And then I have to translate that

232
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,880
to a different language

233
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,560
that someone else have to go ahead

234
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,360
and execute.

235
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,960
So you have to do ...

236
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,000
So, both are very similar

237
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,320
in that kind of way,

238
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,920
but what's nice about building startups

239
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,800
is that you see the small dents

240
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,600
that you're making.

241
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,080
It's not going to be there for years,

242
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,480
people are not living in it,

243
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,080
but you're making this dent

244
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,160
and you see it immediately.

245
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,440
And ... it's pretty exciting

246
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,200
because you see it from scratch

247
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,560
coming real, it's kind of magic in a way.

248
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,040
And in larger companies,

249
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,160
what's amazing is seeing the data.

250
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,600
It's building something

251
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,280
and then you're putting it out there.

252
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,160
Millions of people are using it

253
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,880
the day after.

254
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,100
And then you're starting to see

255
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,960
the effect of it.

256
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,000
And the effect is amazing,

257
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,800
because if you are doing something

258
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,400
that has meaning,

259
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,480
then you automatically,

260
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,200
when you A/B test it,

261
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,800
you automatically see the difference.

262
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,480
You see it, it's just there.

263
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,000
That's a different-

264
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,440
Right. So, you have the privilege

265
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,240
of both running an early stage startup,

266
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,200
which also got acquired.

267
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,360
So you were saying how

268
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,480
you have this hypothesis, but really,

269
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,600
only to get to be able

270
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,280
to test this hypothesis, which really

271
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,840
is the essence of the company,

272
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,040
it can take a lot of time

273
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,640
and this is sort of the make or break moment.

274
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,320
And then you go on

275
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,280
and you're running a product

276
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,080
within Lyft.

277
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,960
And you're get to see ...

278
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,760
We have this hypothesis,

279
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,080
let's just roll something out

280
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,880
to do A/B testing,

281
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,680
and within the next day,

282
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,240
we can make some executive decisions

283
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
and hypothesize on how

284
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
this is going to grow.

285
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,720
Talk to me a little bit about this product

286
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,640
you were building at Lyft

287
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,760
and some of this process

288
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
that you went through

289
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,040
as a product manager,

290
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,160
perhaps even looking

291
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,320
at some of the lessons you learned

292
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,240
from your architecture days.

293
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,480
Sure. So actually I think, in a way,

294
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,080
the product I built for lift, actually,

295
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,920
I used some of the understanding

296
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,880
of how cities and people work,

297
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,760
how they behave.

298
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,440
Yeah, because the first product

299
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,600
I built for Lyft was around commute.

300
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,160
What I was doing at Lyft

301
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,440
was running shared ride experiences,

302
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,600
which is basically every new experience

303
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,400
or new product

304
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,680
that more than one rider is using.

305
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,600
And so ... one was focusing on commute

306
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,680
and was this idea around,

307
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,280
Okay so, for Lyft,

308
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,680
you're tapping a button

309
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,120
and you're getting a driver

310
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,520
and they take you to the place

311
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,600
that you need to go

312
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,920
which is amazing for a certain people

313
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,320
or for certain situations,

314
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,960
but if you are not making

315
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,920
like a lot of money,

316
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,360
you can't use ... commute.

317
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,320
So, I was trying to figure out

318
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,760
how we can make it cheaper

319
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,160
for people to ride every day.

320
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:48,800
How we can make it more, let's say,

321
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,000
how people can plan around it,

322
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,680
which was very important.

323
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,280
Trying to figure out what's important

324
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,320
for people who commute

325
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,320
is very different than

326
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,040
trying to figure out what is important

327
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,760
when you are going out for a date

328
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,200
or a ride to the airport.
-100%

329
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,800
And some of the values were around

330
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,280
how I can plan around it.

331
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,360
How I can know that I'm getting exactly,

332
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,960
or a very similar experience every day.

333
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,040
That was very important.

334
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,560
The behavioral aspect

335
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
was very important,

336
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,720
more than I imagined.

337
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Apparently people prefer to get,

338
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,720
let's say, a less super experience

339
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,320
in terms of like how long they are riding,

340
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,680
which I think is,

341
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,080
in a way, counterintuitive,

342
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,240
but they would rather ride longer

343
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,520
but if they're riding the same way,

344
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,000
they know exactly how long

345
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,480
it's going to take.

346
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,280
And they're taking the ride

347
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,480
from the same spot

348
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,960
and getting to the same spot.

349
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,600
Sometimes meeting the same people

350
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,400
on the way and riding with them.

351
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,440
That's more important

352
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,440
than getting there the fastest ...

353
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,600
Apparently people prefer to know

354
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,800
that they are going to be at the office

355
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,200
at 9 a.m. rather than like sometimes,

356
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,440
at 8:30 and sometimes at 9:30.

357
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,520
And so, we designed a product

358
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,520
according to that, those insights

359
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,600
that we got from people.

360
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,240
But Orit, how do you get those insights?

361
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,320
Is this solely based on analytics

362
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,000
and you're watching

363
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,240
how hundreds of thousands of people

364
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,720
are interacting with your product

365
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,240
and whether what is the churn rate

366
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,960
and what they're focusing on?

367
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,360
Or do you actually have to go

368
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,560
and speak to them personally?

369
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,360
How does it even work?

370
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,760
So, that's the nice thing

371
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,240
about a big company.

372
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,640
When you're in a very large company

373
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,920
with a very large user base,

374
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,440
you can do both.

375
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:44,800
And the thing about asking questions

376
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,160
are you have to ask the right questions.

377
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,360
And you don't know how to ask

378
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,160
the right questions

379
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,480
and then try to figure it out with data

380
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,720
if you don't have a hypothesis.

381
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,440
So, to get that hypothesis,

382
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,840
you have to have good intuition, I think,

383
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,240
and a lot of empathy to your users.

384
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,920
And you have to speak with them.

385
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,160
So I would say the process, in a way,

386
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,840
in the beginning,

387
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,120
is more similar to building a startup ...

388
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,880
First you have to talk face to face

389
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,400
with people who experience it who,

390
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,840
and you have to ask the right questions.

391
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,320
You don't want to influence them.

392
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,880
You don't want to have these ideas

393
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,240
that you're having ...

394
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,040
in their minds.

395
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,280
You have to get the real problems,

396
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,640
the real pains, figure them out,

397
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,440
and then try to solve them.

398
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,200
And once you do that, you can try

399
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,000
and ask the questions with data.

400
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,640
You can try and figure out

401
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,840
if you are right or wrong.

402
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,720
And usually the right way you do it

403
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,560
is not go ahead

404
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,240
and build this huge product

405
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,720
that is containing everything

406
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,560
you had in mind

407
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,520
and have this amazing experience

408
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,120
end to end all figured out,

409
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,000
because you're probably

410
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,600
going to be wrong about at least some of it.

411
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,800
And then, the way I think about it is,

412
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,280
you have to break your assumptions

413
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,640
to little pieces

414
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,120
and try the leanest way

415
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,880
to figure each one out with data.

416
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,040
And once you have that

417
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,480
and have you know,

418
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,080
you can start to build

419
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,920
your bigger vision

420
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,360
and transform it into a product.

421
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,920
Again, something very, very different

422
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,240
from when you're designing a building

423
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,720
that is meant to bring a delight

424
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,000
to the customers.

425
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,760
And there, you can't really just build

426
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,640
like one room and then say,

427
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,360
"Hey, do you like this?"

428
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,200
Maybe you can, I don't know.

429
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,240
Maybe it's sophisticated enough.

430
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,600
But it sounds like especially

431
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,360
when you're running a startup

432
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,920
or product manager at Lyft,

433
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,000
you were able to take these

434
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,680
very small chunks of hypotheses

435
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,520
and implement them in small scenarios

436
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,760
and test them out.

437
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,920
But I want to talk a little bit

438
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,640
about the insights that are leading now

439
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,200
towards your next venture,

440
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,920
which hopefully by the time this airs,

441
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,800
we'll know a little bit about.

442
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,720
What are those insights?

443
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,000
What got you really excited

444
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,520
into this idea of the future of workforce?

445
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,600
So I think one of the reasons

446
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,200
I was starting to be kind of obsessed

447
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,360
with this problem space was,

448
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,720
I was naturally taking Lyfts every day,

449
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,680
twice a day, at least.

450
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,800
And I was talking to the drivers

451
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,760
all the time.

452
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,280
Sometimes it was part of the work.

453
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,320
Most of the time, just because

454
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,120
I liked talking with people.

455
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,000
And then, I tried to figure out

456
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,440
what's bothering them.

457
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,120
Why are they doing it?

458
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,840
And I felt very fortunate to work

459
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,080
for a ride sharing company,

460
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,080
because I felt it gives the drivers

461
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,520
this opportunity to make a living

462
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,800
when sometimes they can't.

463
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,640
Many of the people had those situations

464
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,840
where they were unemployed

465
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,880
and or between jobs or moving between

466
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,640
one geography to another

467
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,840
or waiting to get their certificate.

468
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,100
And so being able to ... them.

469
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,280
So, I think that opportunity they had

470
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,760
to be able to just get in the car

471
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,000
and start earning money

472
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,040
so they won't lose everything

473
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,280
was really important.

474
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,800
To me, it was a great mission,

475
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,560
a great crowd to work for.

476
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,800
But then underneath that big mission

477
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,400
and that opportunity,

478
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,400
lies a lot of problems

479
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,920
that are unsolved yet

480
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,560
just with ride sharing.

481
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,600
So talking with them,

482
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,000
I thought that sometimes

483
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,440
they don't want to do it

484
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,800
because maybe they don't have a prospect.

485
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,160
They can't see how

486
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,280
they're going to have to progress

487
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,960
or have to learn something new

488
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,440
or to have a career path

489
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,480
or possibly do just between some parts,

490
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,120
between jobs.

491
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,480
And then other problems

492
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,960
were that they were thinking

493
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,280
they can make a living,

494
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,520
but not all drivers can make a living

495
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,760
out of ride sharing.

496
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,160
It's just the nature

497
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,520
of how those marketplaces work is

498
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,080
that they have peak hours and downtimes,

499
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,640
and some drivers

500
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,080
can really optimize their time

501
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,720a
and sometimes they are very lucky

502
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,480
and they can get enough rides,

503
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,800
but if they're not at the right place

504
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,560
at the right times,

505
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,640
they just don't get rides

506
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,280
and they can't make a living ...

507
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,800
just driving.

508
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,440
Well, statistically,

509
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,560
more than 80% of the drivers

510
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,760
are working on more than one platform

511
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,800
because of that.

512
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,040
Really? Okay.

513
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,560
Yeah, it's crazy,

514
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,320
but that's the number.

515
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,160
And so I was thinking

516
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,640
how can I make those people's life better?

517
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,600
How can I provide them

518
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,640
with everything that is lacking,

519
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,280
and how can I build a product

520
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,120
that will suite them?

521
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,120
And that's how I started Overall,

522
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,360
which is still in stealth mode.

523
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,160
So, unfortunately I'm not going

524
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,840
to talk a lot about what it is exactly,

525
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,840
but stay tuned.

526
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,000
I love it. I love it.

527
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,880
Well Orit, best of luck with Overall.

528
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,560
Just in two in two sentences,

529
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,440
give me a little bit of taste

530
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,680
as to what Keeprz was

531
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,320
and a little bit about

532
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,360
being a first time entrepreneur running

533
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,240
You've joined

534
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,600
early stage companies before,

535
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,240
but now you're running

536
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:53,880
your own company,

537
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,000
you're one of the co-founders.

538
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,120
You get to the acquisition.

539
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,720
What are some of the key moments

540
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,360
in that journey

541
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,480
that you're gonna take with you

542
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,880
into your next venture?

543
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,200
So, there are several.

544
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,840
And I think, and looking at that,

545
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,640
it's not just Keeprz,

546
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,120
it's I think it's kind of a thing

547
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,200
that was built throughout my career

548
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,520
and you can kind of connect the dots.

549
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,880
So, Keeprz was an amazing experience.

550
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,920
It was the first time I'm an entrepreneur.

551
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
I saw how it was done

552
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,440
by other great enterprise

553
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,440
I work with and ... done it before.

554
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,400
And I think one of the amazing things

555
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,960
that I discovered was

556
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,880
that I can be jack of all trades.

557
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,840
I can do everything.

558
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,200
I was designing the screenings

559
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,600
with illustrator skills

560
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,120
that I had from Bezalel.

561
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,120
And I was building the experiences

562
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,240
and I was marketing

563
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,720
and analyzing the data we had

564
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,680
and interviewing potential clients.

565
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,400
And I just had to do all of it

566
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,920
and be good, good enough,

567
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,800
let's say, with everything.

568
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,280
And then, when I got to Lyft,

569
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,200
I figured that kind of skill

570
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,800
is not required anymore.

571
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,200
I didn't have to do everything anymore.

572
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,640
Actually, I wasn't supposed

573
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,680
it wasn't a good idea

574
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,560
to do everything by myself.

575
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,760
Lyft had amazing engineers

576
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,400
and data scientists and great designers,

577
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,240
and then I had to figure out well, then

578
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,320
what is my role here.

579
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,840
Right.

580
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,520
And I think my main lesson was

581
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,360
I have to take those amazing people

582
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,440
and make sure that the good ideas

583
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,800
that I'm having are resonating with them.

584
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,520
Everyone knows what direction

585
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,360
they have to run.

586
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,120
And then run the fastest they can

587
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,400
to ...

588
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,760
And taking that lesson with me,

589
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,960
actually I think it's pretty much

590
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,520
I take it now to my new startup

591
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,440
even though it's just starting.

592
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,760
And it's not ...

593
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,600
I still have to be jack of all trades,

594
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,560
but building the team

595
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,000
means I have to think about

596
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,880
what kind of team I'm building,

597
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,040
what kind of culture,

598
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,560
a culture which puts those people

599
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,800
in the center of things

600
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,760
and being aligned and working together

601
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,560
and bringing A type people.

602
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,120
10X engineers, 10X designers,

603
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,680
because once you have

604
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,880
those amazing people,

605
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,920
you just have to lead the way

606
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,120
and everything kind of happens the right way.

607
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,600
Orit, thank you again

608
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,880
for being so generous with your time

609
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,720
and for all the insight.

610
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,600
This was wonderful.

611
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,360
Before we leave, I need three words

612
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,560
that you would use to describe yourself.

613
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,080
Okay. So, I would say

614
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,200
creative or creating.

615
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,120
That's the one thing that's important for me.

616
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,200
That's why I'm waking up in the morning.

617
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,400
The other word I would say

618
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,520
would be doubt.

619
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,480
I'm doubting ...

620
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,720
I don't take anything for granted.

621
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,720
I try to check, I try to figure out

622
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,280
if the assumptions are right.

623
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,720
I think that would be the second one.

624
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,560
The third one would probably be family.

625
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,280
I love it.

626
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,760
The one most important thing

627
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,960
in my life.

628
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,480
100% and I'm sure it's gonna be

629
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,600
an interesting ride going through now

630
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,480
an early stage startup

631
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,680
still in stealth mode with the family.

632
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,360
But best of luck

633
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,160
and I can't wait to see more

634
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,000
about Overall,

635
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,760
and thank you again

636
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,880
for being so generous with your time.

637
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,440
It's really great.

638
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,970
Thank you for having me.

639
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,000
Take care.
