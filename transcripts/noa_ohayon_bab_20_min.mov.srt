1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,160
Even if you get higher education,

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,000
no, almost no major can

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,960
actually prepare you

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,280
to today's job market and and workplaces.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,920
Those are the place that kind of give you

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,120
the skills and teach you the hands on.

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,520
Noa Ohayon Bab,

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,480
thank you so much for taking time out

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,760
of your busy schedule to be with me.

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,200
How are you?

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,760
Great.

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,760
I'm really happy and excited

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,400
to join you today.

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,840
Thank you very, very much.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,120
Noah, if I begin to list

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,040
the different things that you've done,

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,000
the 20 minutes would be fast over.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,400
But just for reference,

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,320
so that we can structure

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,400
the conversation a little bit.

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,520
You're running marketing

22
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,720
for a startup, Colu.

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,800
You're head of community

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,560
for then for eBay.

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,120
Today you're the head of the

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,200
Israeli delegation to Washington, DC.

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,080
But you're also a speechwriter

28
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,880
for a very famous politicians,

29
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,080
which you managed to put in

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,760
your children's names in there

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,720
from time to time, right?

32
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,680
But one of the most important things,

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,880
I think, is that you competed against

34
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,920
on a [--] on a trivia game show.

35
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,022
We did indeed. And lost.

36
00:01:37,023 --> 00:01:40,200
And lost.

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,320
Tell me about that experience.

38
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,320
You're in "Who's the last standing", right?

39
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,760
Yes.

40
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,520
Yes, true.

41
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,400
And I was petrified

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,320
being in front of the basketball player.

43
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,880
And I'm like, "Oh,

44
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,600
they're going to ask me

45
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,080
some question about sports."

46
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,480
And if there is something I'm not good at

47
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
it's sports questions.

48
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,160
And I end up losing

49
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,920
to a question about a book,

50
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,680
which is my passion,

51
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,040
my hobby, my major.

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,280
You studied literature.

53
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,560
Yes. That was very true.

54
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,800
I would say it's not a very good one.

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,000
It's not a very good book,

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,920
the one that I missed.

57
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,120
So, I'm kind of okay with

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,480
losing on that one.

59
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,880
But I love it.

60
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,640
I love it.

61
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Noa, even when I was listing the things,

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,320
and it's important for me

63
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,280
not to have anything written

64
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,360
because I try to be spontaneous.

65
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,160
But I forgot to mention that you also

66
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,400
just casually co-founded

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,160
one of the leading job search platforms

68
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,240
in Israel, which we'll get to as well.

69
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,080
But Noa, talk to me

70
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,480
about your life journey,

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,360
because that's fascinating.

72
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
You're starting out with literature.

73
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,520
You're writing speeches

74
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,600
for famous politicians,

75
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,400
which I want to hear

76
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,280
about what that's like.

77
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,120
And then, you all of a sudden

78
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
find yourself in the tech scene.

79
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,920
So, start from the speech writing

80
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,520
and then let's move on to the tech scene.

81
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,640
So, if we again smoother,

82
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,880
I actually started as an educator

83
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,040
because like everybody else,

84
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,520
I wanted to change the world for better.

85
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,800
I guess I just want

86
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,960
to make the world a better place.

87
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,640
And they said, well,

88
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,080
education would be "it" probably, right?

89
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,960
Especially in Israel

90
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,040
when you have so many

91
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,720
minority groups and such a huge gap

92
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,120
in between certain populations.

93
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,960
So, I said, "Okay, I'm going

94
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,520
to deep dive into that."

95
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,840
My original kind of ambition would be

96
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,920
like the minister of education.

97
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,840
And then I said,

98
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,480
"A teacher would be a good start." I'd say.

99
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,480
And I thought that would be

100
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,800
the most effective way.

101
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Everybody goes through

102
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,440
the education system,

103
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,320
at the same time, also working

104
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,560
in the big philanthropy organization

105
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,800
with

106
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,480
students,

107
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,640
that came from disadvantaged background,

108
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,040
kind of enabled them

109
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,640
to get higher education

110
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,800
and get the best out of that time period.

111
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,560
And while I was doing all that,

112
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,640
for sure impact, I still felt that I was

113
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,200
kind of restrained in between these

114
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,280
literally four walls sometimes.

115
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:50,720
And I felt that if I

116
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,920
in person want to get

117
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,160
a jump start, but also with the impact,

118
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,200
I want to create, tech would be it.

119
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,600
It's this is the way to go.

120
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,000
If we want to prepare

121
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,840
the generation of the future,

122
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,080
we should definitely

123
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,240
skill them up with those areas.

124
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,760
And I felt that would be

125
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,000
the best thing to do.

126
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,200
And because I had that social media

127
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,240
as a non-profit startup, I'd say,

128
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,680
I was pretty good with everything

129
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,920
related to social media

130
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,000
and online marketing.

131
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,320
And so, that was kind of my ticket

132
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
to make that transition.

133
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,640
But I do have to say, Noa,

134
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,760
I'm stumped for a second

135
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,520
because that's exactly the point

136
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,560
that I keep thinking about.

137
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,120
It's about, while you just talked

138
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,480
about what was the scale, right?

139
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,120
You're saying, I'm making an impact,

140
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,840
it's between four walls.

141
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,440
Every minute that I put into a day,

142
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,400
you can pretty much know,

143
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,240
okay, this is the impact

144
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,200
that I'm producing.

145
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
And how do I now make

146
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,520
this impact at scale

147
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,640
so that I can impact millions of people?

148
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,440
And I'm sure that the work

149
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:51,960
that you were doing

150
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,520
with the students

151
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,280
physically in front of you,

152
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,640
you changed their lives.

153
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,200
But then you would think,

154
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,720
okay, how can I now do this at scale

155
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,480
and change millions

156
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,840
of people's lives, right?

157
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,720
Yeah, exactly.

158
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,120
So, scaling is it, you know.

159
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,760
Tech and scale is that so.

160
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,320
It's kind of doing automation of impact,

161
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,440
I would say.

162
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,680
And so, that kind of that's how

163
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,120
I made the transition into tech.

164
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,280
Obviously this can be

165
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,120
a whole conversation to itself

166
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,240
because I know many people

167
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,920
have that kind of ambition

168
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,440
to do that transition to both ways.

169
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,280
I get it out of course from people

170
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,720
who want to do the other way around.

171
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,840
And also, it's there's the language,

172
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,120
it's not just the language.

173
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,320
Translating your resume from,

174
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,560
let's say, Hebrew to English.

175
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,960
It's translating your resume from English

176
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,600
to tackle whatever language it is.

177
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,960
And each sector has its own lingo,

178
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,120
and kind of in a world.

179
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,960
It's like classic

180
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,360
with our minister of technology

181
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,880
moving from VC to the public sector.

182
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,760
But you're right,

183
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,840
the transition is both ways.

184
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,200
But yeah. Sorry, I keep interrupting you.

185
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,560
That's what I told you,

186
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,720
I want to hear more about you

187
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,160
than speak about myself,

188
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,520
but will do the other around this time.

189
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,720
And yeah, so I started off at in tech,

190
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,080
in the FinTech startup, which was

191
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,560
completely out of my comfort zone.

192
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,520
And I do give a huge kudos to this startup

193
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,080
that saw the potential in me.

194
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,840
And it was kind of a smart move also

195
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,720
from my end to give an opportunity

196
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,360
to an early stage startup,

197
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,040
because this is also kind of a tip

198
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,600
for people who were seeking

199
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,840
to do that transition.

200
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,880
And it was the best

201
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,800
school I could think of

202
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
working in a startup.

203
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,040
Especially in Israel,

204
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,920
it's like there's 30 hours a day

205
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,920
or 36 hours a day instead of 24.

206
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,960
It's you learn so much.

207
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,960
And it was literally the best school.

208
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:48,800
And I do believe that

209
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,040
employers,

210
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,320
and also companies

211
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,680
are the schools of today,

212
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,640
if we mentioned education and so on.

213
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:59,560
So, even if you get higher education, no,

214
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,680
almost no major can actually prepare you

215
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,000
to today's job market and workplaces.

216
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,320
Those are the place to kind of

217
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,360
give you the skills

218
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,160
and teach you the hands-on work.

219
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
So, yeah, so that was

220
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,360
kind of the first step.

221
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,480
And all along I kept on having

222
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,680
my job search platform,

223
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,720
which I co-founded

224
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,560
with a friend named Dana.

225
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,640
And yeah, which also kind of

226
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,080
made it very loud and clear

227
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,720
because I was talking to job seekers

228
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,280
to thousands and tens of thousands

229
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,360
and even more of job seekers,

230
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,400
but at the same times to employers.

231
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,720
And I could see very clearly

232
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,440
kind of this gap between

233
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,040
you write your resume, hope for the best,

234
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,080
do whatever you can

235
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,480
to put yourself into words,

236
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,440
and then you send them out

237
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,720
and hope that someone gets them.

238
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,280
But we all know that

239
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,200
even if they get them,

240
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,680
they get a chance to read so few of them.

241
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,080
So, that's kind of definitely

242
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,600
a market disruption

243
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
that I care a lot about.

244
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,440
And obviously, I have to say

245
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,080
that you're being very

246
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,200
humble by just saying

247
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,280
that you co-founded this platform.

248
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,360
This is one of the most popular platforms

249
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,880
in Israel for job searching with hundreds

250
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,040
of thousands of visitors per month

251
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,400
and tens of thousands

252
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,200
of active engagements.

253
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,720
And we're talking about here

254
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,400
people's lives, people's livelihoods.

255
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,160
This is not just another product.

256
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,760
This is literally finding people jobs.

257
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,400
For some people,

258
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,520
it's to get food on the table.

259
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,400
For others,

260
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,200
it's for different fulfillment.

261
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,440
So, that's incredible.

262
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,920
Noa, you moved from Colu to eBay.

263
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,080
And now you're about community

264
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,600
and you're about engagement.

265
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,520
What does that mean to you?

266
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,480
So, first of all, thank you so

267
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,040
for putting that in such good wording,

268
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,640
because people keep on asking.

269
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,680
I've been doing it for over than 10 years

270
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,640
and we have a group of seven volunteers

271
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,280
and people are like,

272
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,760
why are you doing it?

273
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,920
We do it voluntarily.

274
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,440
We don't, we're not for this.

275
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,160
Amazing.

276
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,040
We're not getting paid.

277
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,400
And when people ask me,

278
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,440
"Do you not feeling...?"

279
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,160
In Hebrew there's a special word for it,

280
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,720
fry or fly, which means:

281
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,320
do you not feel like you could get

282
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,400
you're able to get so

283
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,120
much money out of this?

284
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,840
And I'm like, I want to make sure

285
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,720
I keep it free for both sides.

286
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,520
So people, so organization

287
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,600
will be more than happy

288
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:19,160
to send us as many jobs as possible,

289
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,480
especially during covid.

290
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,200
At the same time,

291
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,440
we're going to keep it free

292
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,280
for those who are job seeking.

293
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,040
And we all know that that can be

294
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,280
the toughest time out of someone's lives.

295
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,400
Yeah.

296
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,120
So, if you're actually about community,

297
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,520
so, you know, this is pretty smooth

298
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,240
because if we're talking about community,

299
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,360
I guess it's exactly it.

300
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,560
It's being able to,

301
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,760
in a way to advance your life.

302
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,720
And I do think when you talk about

303
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,640
online communities and Facebook

304
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,560
and social media, many of the times

305
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,840
you would hear people

306
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,440
criticize it and say

307
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,120
it's shallow and it's a waste of time

308
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,760
and it's only self bragging and so on.

309
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:06,080
And I do believe that

310
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,120
we can use social media

311
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,520
and even online marketing

312
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,960
to benefit our life,

313
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,920
to become better parents.

314
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,320
I get a ton of advice.

315
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,840
I'm sure I'm a better mom

316
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,480
since I've been using mom groups

317
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,000
and parents groups online,

318
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,760
and it makes us better professionals.

319
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,520
And honestly, it's just

320
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,880
it's I do believe this is the way to go.

321
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,920
And if you talk about

322
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,160
companies and tech companies,

323
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,120
I think for everyone it is very clear

324
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,880
that old days, marketing,

325
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,040
the one that you think of a slogan

326
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,200
of a catch phrase,

327
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,960
you think of the best image,

328
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,680
it's just not enough.

329
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,520
None of us is going to make enough vision

330
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,840
of what cell phone to buy

331
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,120
because they have Galgadot, which I love.

332
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,280
Yeah, I don't want to [--].

333
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,320
All of us do.

334
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,440
But it's just not enough.

335
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,720
I'm not going to get someone

336
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,960
just because they have

337
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,760
an amazingly beautiful face on it.

338
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,360
I'm going to do it because,

339
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,960
because I'm going to find this blog

340
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,000
or just a friend or a Facebook group

341
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,680
that I appreciate and I'm going to search

342
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,680
and I'm going to see some reviews

343
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,000
and make up my mind based on that

344
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,680
more than anything else.

345
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,480
And this goes for honestly,

346
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,520
almost everything you do

347
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,680
if you think about it.

348
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,600
And also studies shows that 40%

349
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,560
of the consumer choice we made

350
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,320
are based on ear to mouth.

351
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,080
And this is how

352
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,880
we make our choices today.

353
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,120
And that's why reviews are so big.

354
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,440
And so many startups

355
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,040
and companies are around reviews.

356
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,280
But at the same time,

357
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,760
community and consumer community

358
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,360
or a product community,

359
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,400
this is honestly this is the way you go.

360
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,360
And eBay, the boss I had,

361
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,520
which is also a funny story,

362
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,040
he heard me interviewed

363
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,440
on another podcast

364
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,640
about online communities.

365
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,160
And when the site in Israel wanted

366
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,240
to try and kind of put up a team for that,

367
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,480
they were looking for a team leader.

368
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,280
And so, he heard me on that podcast

369
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,760
and so he reached out.

370
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,200
And it was so funny because

371
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,840
it was exactly that

372
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,760
they wanted to do this experiment

373
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,520
where they take their users,

374
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,800
their product users around a certain area

375
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
and kind of build the community around it

376
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,880
and see how we curate products better,

377
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,000
how we create an inner community.

378
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,960
Let's say,

379
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,360
if it's buyers on eBay or Amazon,

380
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
how do you create their own

381
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,120
inner community to share your problem,

382
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,760
best practices and so on.

383
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,520
That is fascinating.

384
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,880
I think that what you said before,

385
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,240
which really resonated with me,

386
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,800
you said that the pretty face

387
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,000
and the logo and the message,

388
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,800
is it's not enough.

389
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,520
And I hear some people say that

390
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,880
that branding and marketing has changed.

391
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,160
I don't think the change is about it.

392
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,680
What you're saying is

393
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,720
it's evolved, right?

394
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,400
It is still important.

395
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,760
It's still important to have

396
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,440
the great people presenting it.

397
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,520
The messaging is important,

398
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,600
the logo is important.

399
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,320
But now for me to want

400
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,280
to buy a cell phone,

401
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,880
to for me to want

402
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,440
to engage with the product,

403
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,320
I need something more.

404
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,240
I need to feel a part of the community.

405
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,000
And I think that

406
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,280
that's just something fascinating

407
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,480
that really feels like it's something

408
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,240
out of the last five or six years, right?

409
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,280
That it's really becoming more

410
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,680
and more common,

411
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
which is, I think, incredible.

412
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,080
But I want to make sure we have enough

413
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,800
time also to talk about

414
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,840
what you're doing today.

415
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,320
Because today you're talking

416
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,960
from Washington DC, right?

417
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,200
Yes.

418
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,320
What are you doing there?

419
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,160
Yeah, basically kind of the same,

420
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,120
but just different.

421
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,520
The idea is to have

422
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,360
a Israel representative

423
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,400
live here in America,

424
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,800
working with the community

425
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,360
here in America

426
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,160
and kind of working on the connection

427
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,240
between Israel

428
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,680
and working on that relationship

429
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,080
to kind of make it more depth

430
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,760
than what you hear on the news

431
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,080
and

432
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,280
on social media.

433
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,720
So, this is kind of depict the deep

434
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,040
relationship in between.

435
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,080
And, yeah, I'm leading a group here

436
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,800
and also moved here with my family

437
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,440
on this adventure.

438
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,600
Again, following passion, I guess.

439
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,120
And I definitely love doing that.

440
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:23,960
And I do believe that in some aspects

441
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,080
we can definitely,

442
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,960
some aspects and best practices,

443
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,360
we can bring from outside of the country

444
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,560
here to America and definitely learn

445
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,720
from different cultures.

446
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,760
I can say that

447
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,240
Facebook groups in Israel are so big.

448
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,160
Studies show that people in Israel

449
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,840
spend their time,

450
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,560
at least in two or three Facebook group

451
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,280
and really

452
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,160
consumer, but also for every

453
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,480
other aspect in their life.

454
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,840
And when we had a session

455
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,040
or a committee of people

456
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,480
who lead big community groups

457
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,960
and communities online through Facebook.

458
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,240
So, we met there GM of Israel

459
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,120
and she said that Israel is really

460
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,240
the kind of the top of that pyramid

461
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,840
with innovation around kind of committee.

462
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,880
I guess, because, you know,

463
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,240
it's a good sandbox with those things.

464
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,120
It's a small place.

465
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,040
Everybody knows everyone.

466
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,400
And definitely, yeah.

467
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,800
So again, you're taking community.

468
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,560
But you're going from tech

469
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,760
now back to community.

470
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,880
And I'm guessing that

471
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,720
there is a little bit of a difference

472
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,240
between running the community

473
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,040
and engagement for a startup,

474
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,720
then for a big corporation and now

475
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,640
for more of the government

476
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,600
and more for social issues, right?

477
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,400
Yeah.

478
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,280
And even maybe,

479
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,440
even diplomate in a way.

480
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,960
But I can tell you that throughout

481
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,040
the last decade that I've been doing it

482
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,720
in different aspects, you can see

483
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,160
that some of the essence run the same.

484
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,240
I mean, people want to find their peers

485
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,000
or people they can relate to.

486
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,560
They want to get knowledgeable

487
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,000
from those areas.

488
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,800
And I'd say I think kind of a difference

489
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
between a non-community

490
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,280
or a community is kind of,

491
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,880
or between the old marketing

492
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,800
and the new marketing

493
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,600
will be around two things:

494
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,800
one of them would be

495
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,120
that the communication is both ways.

496
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,240
It's not just a company or organization

497
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,200
or a social cause shouting

498
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,480
out their message,

499
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,600
it goes both ways.

500
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,160
And that one I can speak very close

501
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,240
from working in a startup

502
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,600
because you have your roadmap.

503
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,000
And the product team have their plans

504
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,160
and not want to hear any feedback

505
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,280
from up the street.

506
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,920
And kind of make a good buddy from work

507
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,680
a good community manager

508
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,760
and a more advanced marketer.

509
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,160
You would bring that information

510
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,240
back to the team.

511
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,200
I can give you just a tiny example.

512
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,920
When I work for PolyPay,

513
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,960
it's a payment app like Venmo.

514
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,680
And it was new.

515
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,040
Five years ago in Israel,

516
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,560
no one used a payment app.

517
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,280
I remember.

518
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,480
I remember when it was brand new.

519
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:07,880
Yeah.

520
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,240
Yeah.

521
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
So, okay. So thank you.

522
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,840
You probably got tons of emails from me.

523
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,520
You know from Colu, it was me.

524
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,760
And I said no one used it

525
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,560
and we had to educate the market.

526
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,480
And so we asked people,

527
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,120
why don't you feel confident?

528
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,880
We ask, what's kind of your feedback?

529
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,720
And many of them said

530
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,800
they don't feel confident enough

531
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,600
to put in their credit card information.

532
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,480
And so we just added the symbol,

533
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,880
that icon of lock.

534
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,440
And even that just increased the trust

535
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,520
in maybe 30% when it happened.

536
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,840
And it's just a tiny example

537
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,840
of how feedback from users

538
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,160
can really change

539
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,640
your product and your everything.

540
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,520
And so that's one major thing,

541
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
the two sides of communication.

542
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,560
And the other thing is,

543
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,360
to create a space for people

544
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,600
to communicate with each other.

545
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,360
And that also was a good thing.

546
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,480
Because if you're talking

547
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,160
about a tech product, you would say,

548
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,040
why is it important to ask?

549
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,080
But we even just spread

550
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,040
by widening focus group,

551
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,640
they have an opportunity to talk users

552
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,720
where they get the opportunity

553
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,600
to communicate between themselves,

554
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,040
you can actually create not just users,

555
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,720
but passionate community members

556
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,880
of your own product.

557
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,720
And many before me,

558
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,800
Yelp, they build their,

559
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,920
that's basically how

560
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,560
they build themselves up,

561
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,680
bottom up.

562
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,080
Noa, it's just fascinating.

563
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,520
It's so, so relevant

564
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,840
to everything that's happening today

565
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
and the whole evolution

566
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,000
of the company's brand

567
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,920
engagement community,

568
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,880
it's just fascinating

569
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,600
work that you're doing.

570
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,080
And I just love how you are

571
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,400
getting all these different,

572
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
extraordinary experiences.

573
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,520
Half of which we didn't even get

574
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,400
to really dive deep in and talk about.

575
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,360
And that's why I keep beating myself

576
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,000
on the head that I that I called this,

577
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,960
20 Minute Leaders and not

578
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,760
30 minute leaders.

579
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,660
Because oftentimes

580
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,880
I just want to continue.

581
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,960
But unfortunately, I have to now

582
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,160
thank you for being so generous

583
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,680
with your time.

584
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,520
And I have to ask you the last question,

585
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,960
which is three words that you would use

586
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,760
to describe yourself.

587
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,960
So, I would say the first one

588
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,000
would probably be passion.

589
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,210
I hope it goes through it.

590
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:20,640
I am passionate in everything I do,

591
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,440
I'd say probably

592
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,360
the second thing would be community.

593
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,000
It's something I care a lot

594
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,400
through everything I do.

595
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,040
And the third one,

596
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,920
which I had the hardest time choosing,

597
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,960
maybe because it's the last one,

598
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,040
I'd say maybe

599
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,720
adjustable

600
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,120
or kind of-

601
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,760
Yeah.

602
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,160
Yeah. Being-

603
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,640
Dynamic. Adjustable.

604
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,200
Yeah.

605
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,760
Because, you know,

606
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,240
people translate what Darwin said.

607
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,120
And they sometimes you hear

608
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,240
someone said that he said

609
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,240
that the stronger survives.

610
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,600
But if you look closely

611
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,280
at the translation, it says,

612
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,080
that it was more adaptive

613
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,960
that's who survives.

614
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:08,080
And I think that's kind of our generation

615
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,760
and our future generation,

616
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,240
and the reality that we live today,

617
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,200
being adaptive and being able to adjust

618
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,440
to whatever comes your way,

619
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,720
that's kind of the way

620
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,880
to survive, I guess.

621
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,800
But also to enjoy, not just surviving.

622
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,040
Yeah.

623
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,240
Noah, toda raba. Thank you so, so much.

624
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,240
This was just wonderful.

625
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,440
Thank you for the incredible work

626
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,200
that you're doing,

627
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,280
whether it's helping

628
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,720
thousands of people find jobs

629
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,920
or helping spread the message of Israel

630
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
in a better light

631
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,320
and in a more correct light

632
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,680
with actual deep meaning.

633
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,440
And not just headlines from either sides.

634
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,960
And I'm just looking forward to continue

635
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,320
learning from you, from all your journey

636
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,360
and continue maintaining

637
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,000
this relationship.

638
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,160
So, thank you very much.

639
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,520
Same here.

640
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,070
Thank you so much.
