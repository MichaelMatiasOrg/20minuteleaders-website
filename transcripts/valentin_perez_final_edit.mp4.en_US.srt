1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,599
The question that me

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,719
and my co-founder Max,

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,199
Max Deutsch, ask ourselves was

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,559
what type of life do we want to live?

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,359
Right?

6
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,119
And for us, the answer is we just want

7
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,799
to spend time

8
00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:12,300
learning and creating, right?

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,879
Valentin Perez, thank you so much

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,479
for joining me on 20 minute leaders.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,000
How are you?

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,959
Thank you, Michael.

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,483
I'm doing great.

14
00:00:46,484 --> 00:00:47,719
How about you?

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,079
I'm doing fantastic.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,039
Thank you so much for joining me

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,799
and being so generous with your time.

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,719
You're calling from Los Angeles

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,439
and you're actually living

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,639
with Cliff Weitzman

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,879
who I believe was one

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,839
of the first guests on the show

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
which is pretty, pretty cool.

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,600
Amazing, yeah. We're super cool friend.

25
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,239
So, from Mexico,

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,639
went to Brown University,

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,199
co-president of the entrepreneurship

28
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,880
program there,

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,719
got into startups,

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,639
worked in quite a few places,

31
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,919
one of them as a

32
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,639
software engineering intern at Snapchat,

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,845
which I'd love to hear

34
00:01:22,045 --> 00:01:23,319
what that experience is all about.

35
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,719
But now, most recently,

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,919
you are the CEO

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,919
and co-founder of Monthly,

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,199
an online education platform

39
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,959
focusing on month courses, right?

40
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,720
Did I get that right?

41
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,439
Yeah.

42
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,699
The co-founder of Monthly,

43
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,079
and we do one month

44
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,759
hands-on online classes

45
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,200
taught by big creators and artists.

46
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,199
Amazing. Amazing.

47
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,679
So, you know Valentin,

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,839
before we get into really

49
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,626
in the depth of monthly

50
00:01:53,826 --> 00:01:54,479
and what you're doing there,

51
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,228
I'd love to go back a little bit

52
00:01:56,428 --> 00:01:56,953
and talk about

53
00:01:57,153 --> 00:01:58,039
your entrepreneurial journey

54
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,919
and sort of the steps leading up

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,399
to your endeavor right now.

56
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,177
So, when would you consider

57
00:02:04,377 --> 00:02:08,280
you started as an entrepreneur?

58
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,440
Oh, I would say since,

59
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,677
like ever since I can remember.

60
00:02:13,877 --> 00:02:15,439
I was just always

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,399
with the entrepreneurial mindset

62
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,039
and I think it's because of the way

63
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,319
that I grew up and the way that

64
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,258
my parents raised me,

65
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,002
like one of the earliest questions

66
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:27,362
that I always remember

67
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:28,679
my dad asking myself is,

68
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,879
would you rather be the

69
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,799
tail of a lion or the head of a mouse?

70
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,963
And I would always ironically answer

71
00:02:39,163 --> 00:02:40,719
the head of a lion.

72
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,972
But for him, he was always like

73
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:44,804
asking that question

74
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:46,599
kind of rhetorically,

75
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,821
that it's better to be

76
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:49,066
the head of a mouse,

77
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:50,319
even if the small thing.

78
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,799
You be the entrepreneur,

79
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,999
the person like leading

80
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,879
or having your own

81
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,924
charge of your own destiny

82
00:02:59,124 --> 00:03:00,543
than being the tail

83
00:03:00,743 --> 00:03:03,227
of a bigger organization

84
00:03:03,427 --> 00:03:05,400
or some other group.

85
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,637
So, ever since I was a kid,

86
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:11,799
I was always working on projects,

87
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,639
selling things,

88
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,159
like building stuff,

89
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,720
you know, websites, apps, robots,

90
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,199
selling sushi across my neighborhood,

91
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,160
like everything that you can imagine.

92
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,559
Yeah.

93
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,040
So, what was the motivation for it?

94
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:30,179
Sorry?

95
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,639
What was the motivation

96
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,999
for doing all those projects?

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,399
Was it simply to make money

98
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,479
were some people sell lemonade

99
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,219
in a lemonade stand

100
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:38,919
or you did the other

101
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,679
entrepreneur projects?

102
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,719
Or was there other reasons

103
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,480
why you went about them?

104
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,773
Yeah, I mean,

105
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:47,319
I think when I was a kid,

106
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,279
it was mostly fun.

107
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,007
It was just like

108
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:52,494
I was just having fun playing around,

109
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:56,159
that's what I found fun, fulfilling.

110
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,199
And then it was also about

111
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,559
sort of getting into creating value

112
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,999
and helping other people, right?

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,799
So, I see entrepreneurship is just

114
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,880
literally the way

115
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,681
like you're creating value

116
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,762
and you're helping improve

117
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:11,919
other people's lives.

118
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,639
And then I think there is like,

119
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,119
a fun, play, creating value,

120
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,439
but a big part of it for me, too,

121
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,279
is curiosity and like

122
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,199
learning new things

123
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,106
and understanding

124
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,919
new parts of the world

125
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,560
and that maybe as experimenting.

126
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,573
I think some other motivators for me

127
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:38,679
are love, just coming,

128
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,200
like giving love, receiving love.

129
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,919
Gratefulness, always being

130
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,919
grateful about what I have

131
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,439
and making the most out of the

132
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,377
opportunities and chances

133
00:04:50,577 --> 00:04:52,439
that I have.

134
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,759
And I think that creating value

135
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,520
goes with the desire to be useful.

136
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,439
Yeah, it's just creating value,

137
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,439
love, gratefulness, curiosity, play, fun.

138
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:03,944
Right.

139
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:05,959
So, you're talking about

140
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,359
creating value, love, curiosity.

141
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,359
If I recall correctly,

142
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,792
one of the things that you also did

143
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:13,689
is send a newsletter

144
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:15,640
with a bunch of gifts.

145
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:15,959
Right?

146
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,679
Talk to me a little bit

147
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,320
about that newsletter.

148
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,800
Yeah, so.

149
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,480
One thing I love doing

150
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,560
is curating things.

151
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,120
So, ever since I was a kid,

152
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,699
I had a list of my favorite quotes,

153
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,098
or like a list

154
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:35,239
of my favorite articles.

155
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,440
And I always just

156
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,080
stored all these things.

157
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,360
And I love finding the gems

158
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,320
in the Internet of, like,

159
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,439
what are the best videos,

160
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,294
what are the best articles,

161
00:05:43,494 --> 00:05:45,550
what are the best ideas,

162
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,519
what are the best books.

163
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,999
And I just like have

164
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,080
a lot of fun doing this.

165
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,892
And then, part of that is like

166
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:55,759
I also joined a lot of newsletters.

167
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,956
Like I spend a lot of time

168
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,869
just learning things online

169
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:00,879
and part of that was newsletters.

170
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,119
And then I felt, you know,

171
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,920
I'm storing all these things

172
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,000
thinking to myself,

173
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:08,119
why don't I just share all of these

174
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,479
that I've accumulated,

175
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,519
all of these amazing

176
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,759
gems, articles, ideas,

177
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,439
habits, etcetera, and just share

178
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,519
them with my friends and family.

179
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,797
So I just, you know, as an experiment

180
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:19,684
I posted like,

181
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:21,079
hey, would anyone be interested?

182
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,639
And then I got like

183
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,521
hundreds of messages and comments

184
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:26,640
of people that wanted to

185
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,239
get this newsletter

186
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,559
and I just started sending it.

187
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,519
And the premise was, you know,

188
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,549
mouth-watering articles

189
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,439
like juicy books.

190
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,960
Yeah. It's like,

191
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,079
provoke [--] pictures.

192
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,359
So, it was like a cross,

193
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,951
like many different types of media,

194
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:47,839
all of them

195
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,479
the best things that I can find.

196
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,759
And it wasn't only

197
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,359
things that I found throughout the week.

198
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,039
It was like over the years

199
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,879
and the whole lifetime of like

200
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,439
creating all these things.

201
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:58,559
Right?

202
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,839
So, I focused on quality over recency.

203
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,879
And I did sprinkle a bit of recency

204
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,719
because part of my newsletter

205
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,759
was also sending

206
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,066
my favorite songs

207
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:11,319
and new artist that I was finding.

208
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,544
I also just love

209
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:15,960
making Spotify plus, for example.

210
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,772
And yeah,

211
00:07:16,972 --> 00:07:18,839
it was like part of the newsletter.

212
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,519
And it actually was

213
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,759
extremely fun and rewarding

214
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,177
because it was a way

215
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,433
to keep in touch

216
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:26,992
with a ton of friends

217
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:28,480
and family and people.

218
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,880
I only have to write this email once

219
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,520
and send it once a week and it gets

220
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:35,140
to like hundreds of people.

221
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,236
And then if anyone,

222
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:37,320
if they're interested,

223
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,040
they can reply or not.

224
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,080
But I always had, like,

225
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,800
people sharing back more thoughts,

226
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:43,520
more ideas,

227
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:44,719
like just having a conversation.

228
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,679
There was just absolute blast.

229
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,959
I think that's

230
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,599
there's so much ingenuity in that.

231
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,974
I took inspiration from

232
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,279
a great friend of mine, Drew Bent.

233
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,959
I don't know if you got to meet him,

234
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,304
but he's a Knight-Hennessy scholar

235
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:01,199
at Stanford.

236
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,635
And he went to MIT launch with me.

237
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:06,279
And he send out this year-end review

238
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,529
Drew's Year-End Review

239
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:09,959
as a one time

240
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,959
once a year newsletter.

241
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,399
And I started adopting that,

242
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,639
doing it more quarterly or biannually.

243
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,079
And it was amazing

244
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,107
to see how with one email

245
00:08:19,307 --> 00:08:21,520
I can reach hundreds of people.

246
00:08:21,521 --> 00:08:22,359
And all of a sudden

247
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,160
you get their responses

248
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,560
and you're invigorating

249
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,680
these connections.

250
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:27,741
And I think that

251
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,480
it's such a wonderful technique

252
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,919
to get in touch with people.

253
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,239
I'm obviously enjoying meeting new people

254
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,879
and maintaining relationships

255
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,599
through a show like this.

256
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,315
So, I'm definitely in favor

257
00:08:38,515 --> 00:08:40,199
of all of these different endeavors.

258
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,279
Talk to me a little bit about

259
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,719
entrepreneurship at Brown University.

260
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,166
What does it mean to be

261
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:49,399
an American college student in America?

262
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,034
You're from Mexico

263
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:51,959
but you're studying college in America.

264
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,039
And you're leading

265
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,879
an entrepreneurship experience

266
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,279
also for other students.

267
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,080
What was that about?

268
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,879
Yeah, so for me,

269
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,744
I just, I knew

270
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,416
that I wanted to get involved

271
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:07,039
with the entrepreneurship scene

272
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,119
even before I got into Brown.

273
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,639
Once I got to Brown, like,

274
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,159
that was like the first thing that I did.

275
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,968
I joined the hackathon

276
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:15,530
and the hackathon organizing team

277
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,759
because I went to the hackathon

278
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,919
as a high schooler before Brown.

279
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,284
And so,

280
00:09:19,484 --> 00:09:21,159
I knew I want to be a part of that.

281
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,239
And when I got to Brown, like,

282
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,639
I knew that I wanted to continue working

283
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,559
on my own entrepreneurial projects.

284
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,435
But I also,

285
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:31,239
I saw super valuable as like,

286
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,479
you know, meeting all the other

287
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,005
entrepreneurs, all the people interested

288
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:36,520
in making things right.

289
00:09:36,521 --> 00:09:38,119
So, what better way

290
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,999
than by taking the lead

291
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,839
in the entrepreneurship club

292
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,359
and finding these people,

293
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,399
cultivating these people,

294
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,399
and cultivating an environment

295
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,279
that would be the best place

296
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,119
for entrepreneurship,

297
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,799
like that was my goal.

298
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,595
I just want to make Brown

299
00:09:52,795 --> 00:09:54,033
and a college here

300
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:55,713
that has Brown and RISD,

301
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:58,046
the Rhode Island School of Design

302
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,199
as the best place for entrepreneurship.

303
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah, it was like a ton of fun.

304
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,120
I founded

305
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,160
four different conferences there,

306
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,803
like founded like a speaker series

307
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:13,959
like trips to San Francisco and New York

308
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,887
to visit alumni.

309
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:18,168
Like so many different things,

310
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:22,999
like having 10x the group size,

311
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,279
like double the budget

312
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,159
of the entrepreneurship club,

313
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,199
engage an alumni group.

314
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,039
So, we have like an alumni presence

315
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,599
interview a new and found a new direct,

316
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,599
help find a new director for the new

317
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,639
Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship,

318
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,519
help think about the space and etc.

319
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,199
So, I was super involved in that.

320
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,919
And it was an absolutely

321
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,039
super fulfilling experience

322
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,279
and an amazing learning experience,

323
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,375
because I saw it as a platform

324
00:10:55,575 --> 00:10:57,399
to practice entrepreneurship.

325
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,639
And it was just amazing.

326
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,652
And a platform

327
00:11:01,852 --> 00:11:03,599
to practice entrepreneurship, I think,

328
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,199
it reminds me obviously of the program

329
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,639
we both did at MIT launch.

330
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,959
And it's all about

331
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,359
practicing entrepreneurship.

332
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,460
It's taking a sandbox

333
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,399
that you can't really destroy anything,

334
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,347
because the worst thing

335
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:17,979
that could possibly happen

336
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:19,079
is that you'll say,

337
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,919
Okay, I tried, I failed.

338
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,719
By the way, I'm still

339
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,119
in high school/college.

340
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,459
And it's not like

341
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:26,359
I have children to feed

342
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,279
or family to take care of,

343
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,278
and I'll move on

344
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:30,959
and take the lessons I learned.

345
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,200
So how did that

346
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,280
lead up now to Monthly?

347
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,720
And what are you trying to do

348
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:38,040
with the education space?

349
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,319
Yeah, so with Monthly,

350
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,199
what we're doing is

351
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,486
we're revolutionizing

352
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:48,439
how people learn online.

353
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,680
Like this comes from,

354
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,776
like I as a kid,

355
00:11:51,976 --> 00:11:52,890
like always my favorite thing

356
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:53,519
is learning, right?

357
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,959
Learning and creating things.

358
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,325
So, the question,

359
00:11:57,525 --> 00:11:59,119
I was working on startup,

360
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,919
working on projects,

361
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,918
and then I realized

362
00:12:02,118 --> 00:12:03,593
that I could be working on anything.

363
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,910
Like, I had the resources,

364
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,159
I had the skills.

365
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,639
So, the question that me

366
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,719
and my co-founder, Max,

367
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,199
Max Deutsch ask ourselves was,

368
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,560
what type of life do we want to live?

369
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:16,399
Right?

370
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,532
And for us, the answer is

371
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:18,956
we just want to spend time

372
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,039
learning and creating.

373
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,639
Right?

374
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,119
That's what we love.

375
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,399
And so, how can we build a system

376
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,015
that allows us to live this life

377
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:27,214
and allow other people

378
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,439
to live this life as well.

379
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,679
So, for us, it was like

380
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,912
how do we build

381
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:35,583
the learning platform of our dreams

382
00:12:35,783 --> 00:12:37,759
and who do we want to learn from?

383
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,679
How do we make it as sociable,

384
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,079
amazing experience?

385
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,948
How do you make it so that you finish

386
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:44,159
with tangible projects?

387
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,359
So, for our classes, for example,

388
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,024
all our classes,

389
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,199
you finish with something tangible.

390
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,159
So, in our music production class,

391
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,266
you finish with three songs

392
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:52,358
that you have created

393
00:12:52,558 --> 00:12:53,079
by the end of the month.

394
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,519
In our painting class,

395
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,217
you finish with a realistic portrait

396
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:59,239
or like a painting that is

397
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,839
inspired by your imagination

398
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,759
and your background.

399
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,600
You can finish with film, etc.

400
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,742
And so, these classes,

401
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:09,441
they're different from

402
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:11,279
the normal online classes.

403
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,800
Normal online classes, usually,

404
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,086
there might be just a playlist of videos

405
00:13:15,286 --> 00:13:15,919
that you watch.

406
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,850
But our classes

407
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,399
have a specific start date

408
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,239
and an end date.

409
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,239
All of them are one month,

410
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,799
hence the name, Monthly.

411
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,279
And throughout the experience,

412
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,696
you're put into a peer group

413
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:25,726
of 20 other students

414
00:13:25,926 --> 00:13:26,679
from around the world.

415
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:26,999
Right.?

416
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,015
So, you can invite friends

417
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,759
to be in the same peer group,

418
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,599
but you're in the social experience where

419
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,748
you will see what other people

420
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:35,359
are working on.

421
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,719
You can get feedback,

422
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,599
you receive feedback, you see,

423
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,919
you get inspired, make new friends.

424
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,915
And this peer group

425
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,869
also came from,

426
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:48,039
at Brown,

427
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,679
I started a group called, [--]

428
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,679
where every Saturday

429
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,679
we would meet at my house

430
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,999
in the living room,

431
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,039
and we would just talk about life

432
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,759
and things that we were learning.

433
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,679
And it was just such an intimate,

434
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,640
amazing environment

435
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,709
and I wanted to replicate that

436
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:07,932
within Monthly.

437
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:10,009
So, hence instead of seeing a class

438
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:12,058
that you have like 2000 students

439
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:14,559
and you don't really connect with anyone,

440
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,643
we split into peer groups

441
00:14:15,843 --> 00:14:17,439
so you can connect with the 20 peers

442
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,599
that you're learning with.

443
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,319
And by the end of the month,

444
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,399
you get a feedback.

445
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,159
The creator and the instructor

446
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,839
is also interacting with the students.

447
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,399
And then you all finish

448
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,559
with something that you share.

449
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,334
So, everyone finishes with something

450
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:30,519
that I can't help but share

451
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,319
with all my friends,

452
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,839
family, social media.

453
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,408
And then that just brings in

454
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:35,640
a lot more people in.

455
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,639
That's amazing.

456
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,039
So, just to understand

457
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,839
a little bit better,

458
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,559
the context of where Monthly,

459
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,439
the market the monthly is in,

460
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,840
so, are these mainly

461
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,917
for young adults or kids

462
00:14:50,117 --> 00:14:51,559
that want to acquire

463
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,159
a new skill, a specialized skill,

464
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,120
that you then provide a month long course

465
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,360
that is very intimate, intensive,

466
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:01,718
and then by the end of which

467
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:04,319
they finish with a tangible product?

468
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,040
Is that what you're doing?

469
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,160
Yes.

470
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,400
Our audience is actually, you know,

471
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,880
we've seen people that are

472
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,680
eight year olds to seven year olds,

473
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:18,919
70 year olds, it's like a huge range

474
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,217
of everyone is interested

475
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,356
because our classes are singing,

476
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:24,560
music production, art,

477
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,479
even creative engineering and etc.

478
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,959
We have a big range of topics.

479
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,005
But you're right

480
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:35,012
that the main demographic

481
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:36,919
is young adults.

482
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,479
Mostly,

483
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,520
they might want to improve their skill,

484
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,433
but also a lot of the times,

485
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:45,599
they're just,

486
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,800
there in their corporate job

487
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,125
and they want to do something

488
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:48,920
more with their life.

489
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,120
They want to do something creative,

490
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,080
they want to do something cool,

491
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,880
they want to do something exciting,

492
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,560
or they want to be a part of a community.

493
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,275
And this is

494
00:15:55,475 --> 00:15:56,680
what we're providing to people.

495
00:15:56,681 --> 00:15:58,719
And we see that, you know,

496
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,680
it's transforming people's lives.

497
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,680
People finish the class and they're like,

498
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,520
wow, this has been the most

499
00:16:05,521 --> 00:16:06,959
productive 30 days of my life.

500
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,279
Or I've learned more in this past month

501
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,360
than the past ten years

502
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,440
trying to learn to make music.

503
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,480
And these are quotes

504
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,240
from video testimonials.

505
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,120
At this point, we have thousands

506
00:16:16,121 --> 00:16:17,039
of video testimonials,

507
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,960
people who went out of the way

508
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,943
to record themselves

509
00:16:20,143 --> 00:16:22,446
of how much they love their experience

510
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:23,840
and posted to YouTube.

511
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,879
And it's just been

512
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,663
super inspirational to see

513
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,400
and to see what people are creating,

514
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,839
the connection that they're making.

515
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,652
And, it's crazy to see that

516
00:16:34,852 --> 00:16:35,529
our completion rates

517
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:37,696
for people to finish their classes

518
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,222
are 10x the industry averages

519
00:16:40,422 --> 00:16:41,999
for other online platforms.

520
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,516
Really?

521
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:42,959
Yeah.

522
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,039
Why do you think that is?

523
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,319
What is the factor?

524
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,953
Yeah. I think

525
00:16:48,153 --> 00:16:49,639
it's a combination of factors, right?

526
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,520
So, one,

527
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,999
these classes,

528
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,039
you see the end like

529
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,399
you see what you're working towards.

530
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,319
We frame the classes.

531
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,999
Now this music production class,

532
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,799
you're going to finish with three songs,

533
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,039
right?

534
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,686
And everything in the curriculum

535
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,378
is structured to help you achieve that

536
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:12,159
and get to that point, right?

537
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,294
So, all the videos,

538
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,439
like the projects, the feedback sessions,

539
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,399
and they all build progressively

540
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,479
towards the final projects.

541
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,679
So, that's one thing.

542
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,319
The other thing is the social aspect.

543
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,151
You're in a peer group

544
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:29,136
where you see that other people

545
00:17:29,336 --> 00:17:30,384
are submitting the projects,

546
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:31,319
like watching the video.

547
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,080
So, like monkey see, monkey do.

548
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,542
Like humans are,

549
00:17:35,742 --> 00:17:36,999
like if they see how people doing this,

550
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,599
they don't want to let them down.

551
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,239
Even though they may be strangers,

552
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,359
but they're in your peer group.

553
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,439
They're like, you're going

554
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,079
to get assigned for feedback.

555
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,083
It also helps people.

556
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:48,799
There's deadlines,

557
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,439
and the deadlines are not just arbitrary.

558
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,439
They're actually, in this case are useful

559
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,393
because if you submit in time

560
00:17:55,593 --> 00:17:56,030
the next day,

561
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,039
you're going to get feedback.

562
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,519
If not, you may not get

563
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,239
because you didn't submit.

564
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,039
So that, then obviously

565
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,359
the classes are framed.

566
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,839
That's like a commitment.

567
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,320
So, it's not just

568
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,839
maybe I'll just like pay

569
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,519
for some subscription service that like

570
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,679
maybe I'll get to this later.

571
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,999
Like it usually never happens.

572
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,273
This is like a month

573
00:18:16,473 --> 00:18:17,490
and you're going to commit

574
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,599
and there's a start date

575
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,319
and a finish date.

576
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,359
So, mentally people are prepared for that

577
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,599
and the prices are also high.

578
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:24,799
Right?

579
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,896
So, there's various reasons

580
00:18:27,096 --> 00:18:29,599
why we wanted raise the prices high.

581
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,919
One of them is for the commitment.

582
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,940
Like we want people

583
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,959
to actually commit

584
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,598
and follow through

585
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:34,519
and finish their classes.

586
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,879
So, the classes are priced

587
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,959
around usually $279.

588
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,192
So, people are serious about it

589
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:44,999
and they enroll and they go for it.

590
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,400
I think that's super, super cool.

591
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,439
Yeah.

592
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,454
and like the instructors that we get,

593
00:18:55,654 --> 00:18:56,839
there are always

594
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,226
big name people who already have

595
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:00,039
big audiences are very charismatic

596
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,719
in the way that they teach.

597
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,319
So, people are always engaged.

598
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,981
The curriculum that we design

599
00:19:05,181 --> 00:19:06,245
is very much like,

600
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,635
we spend a lot of time

601
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:09,639
being very meticulous about how we design

602
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,479
a very effective, engaging curriculum.

603
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,359
So, that also helps.

604
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,679
I think it's just like

605
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,559
such a big combination of things.

606
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,599
Well, what surprised you

607
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,159
the most out of the journey?

608
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,609
Or even more interesting than that,

609
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:23,965
what lessons did you take with you

610
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:25,182
from your prior

611
00:19:25,382 --> 00:19:27,079
entrepreneurial experiences

612
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,403
that you're saying like,

613
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:29,341
wow, I'm so glad

614
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:30,679
that I had these experiences

615
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,728
at Brown and at MIT launch

616
00:19:32,928 --> 00:19:33,662
and as a kid,

617
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:35,639
that now I've just started saying,

618
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,799
oh, I've seen this,

619
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,079
I've experienced this,

620
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,120
this is how I want to tackle this?

621
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,319
Yeah. I mean, great question.

622
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,360
I think there's just endless

623
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,892
things and ideas

624
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:48,809
that you can learn from,

625
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:50,239
even from mistakes,

626
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,759
from successes or anything,

627
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,480
I think you can learn.

628
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,680
I think,

629
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,519
are you looking for like a specific

630
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,581
like nuggets of advice

631
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:06,722
or like specific experience

632
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:07,922
that happened?

633
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,825
I'd love to know how you see

634
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:14,239
your prior entrepreneurial experience

635
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,239
folding into or molding into Monthly?

636
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,528
Because a lot of people are saying,

637
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:21,247
yeah, I'll defer entrepreneurship

638
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:23,100
to when I'm good and ready,

639
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,079
I'll accumulate

640
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,982
professional experiences

641
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,679
and then I'll be an entrepreneur.

642
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,856
And here you have an example

643
00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:28,359
of somebody

644
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,399
who's been an entrepreneur

645
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,969
their whole life

646
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:33,280
leading up to this moment.

647
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,239
Oh, yeah, well, I mean,

648
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,119
I think it's there, like,

649
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,799
I just I see anything that comes up

650
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,778
with Monthly, has come up

651
00:20:42,978 --> 00:20:45,283
like most cases like before.

652
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:47,759
Or even if they hasn't come up,

653
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,919
you have the muscle and the exercise

654
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,039
of being able to figure new things out.

655
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,839
And a lot of it is like

656
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,919
pattern recognition.

657
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,159
There are a lot of patterns, even though

658
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,199
that might be slightly different.

659
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,715
It's like slightly similar

660
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:01,959
to other things you've done before.

661
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,079
So, that exercise and practice

662
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,839
of entrepreneurship,

663
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,159
I think is like extremely

664
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,560
valuable and fun and rewarding

665
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,894
and everything that you want

666
00:21:12,094 --> 00:21:13,799
and useful for later on.

667
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,839
I just see it everywhere.

668
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,399
Like, you know,

669
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,200
one thing is with

670
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,319
working with a team and leading people,

671
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,830
I think that was huge when I was

672
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:30,120
a president at Brown.

673
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,759
Others like how do you figure out,

674
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,492
how do you code an app

675
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:36,359
and what needs to get built?

676
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,724
For all the apps

677
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:40,707
that I had before Monthly,

678
00:21:40,907 --> 00:21:43,919
under my time at Brown and before Brown,

679
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,039
I think I had seven

680
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,439
apps in the App Store.

681
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,839
So, I was like very familiar

682
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,199
with the launch process.

683
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,919
And then other learning experiences

684
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,479
was like, you know,

685
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,959
I built something really cool.

686
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,373
But then I realized that

687
00:21:57,573 --> 00:21:59,279
even though the thing was really cool,

688
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,352
it's not going to get to anyone's hands

689
00:22:01,552 --> 00:22:02,839
if there's no distribution.

690
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,439
Right?

691
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,479
So, learning about distribution

692
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,911
and learning about like

693
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:08,985
not talking to users

694
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:12,319
and reading between the lines,

695
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,160
I think a lot of times

696
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,999
you may ask a question,

697
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,359
people may say something,

698
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,919
but they're really meaning something else

699
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,519
or they have a deeper

700
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,959
desire or they're trying to satisfy.

701
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,184
So, it's a lot about

702
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,344
building up that intuition

703
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:30,360
to being able to identify

704
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,160
these things.

705
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,357
I love it.

706
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:38,100
If you were to ask

707
00:22:38,101 --> 00:22:38,999
what people wanted,

708
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,399
they would have said, faster horses.

709
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,239
Right. Right.

710
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,399
100%.

711
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,479
Valentin, I'm sad that

712
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,559
we only have 20 minutes

713
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,999
for this show, but thank you

714
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,839
for being so generous with your time.

715
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,439
Before we finish, what are three words

716
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,400
that you would use to describe yourself.

717
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,920
Good question.

718
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,480
One,

719
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,759
let's say understander.

720
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,079
I love to understand things,

721
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,719
it's like my favorite thing with learning,

722
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,079
thing that I like is understanding.

723
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,800
And so understanding

724
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,719
about the world, about myself,

725
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,519
about people, about concepts, everything.

726
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,606
I just love understanding.

727
00:23:19,806 --> 00:23:22,799
Second one is "differinker".

728
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,138
And this is like a made up word

729
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,359
because basically I just made it up.

730
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,239
It means like "different thinker".

731
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,879
I love to think differently.

732
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,174
I like love to just

733
00:23:33,374 --> 00:23:34,818
go off the beaten path,

734
00:23:35,018 --> 00:23:36,639
like come up with new words,

735
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,999
new ideas, new ways of doing things.

736
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,679
And that's something

737
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,799
that represents that.

738
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,799
And then the third one is

739
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:50,440
"slow-B", is also made up word,

740
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,999
which means that I love

741
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,699
focusing on slope

742
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:56,679
more than a Y intercept.

743
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,917
And this comes from a quote

744
00:23:59,117 --> 00:24:00,159
that I love is,

745
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,959
"a little bit of slope

746
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,759
makes up for a lot of y intercept".

747
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,160
Right?

748
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,279
So, Y intercept is,

749
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,258
where you may be right

750
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:13,279
and that like, if you see two lines,

751
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,717
like I may not have it

752
00:24:14,917 --> 00:24:16,726
be able to draw this,

753
00:24:16,926 --> 00:24:17,759
but usually,

754
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,559
what matters most is the slope.

755
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,416
Even if you started,

756
00:24:20,616 --> 00:24:22,039
there's a line that started up here.

757
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,199
The slope is like this.

758
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,079
If you started down here,

759
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,079
the slope is like this.

760
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,319
It'll cross it in short amount of time.

761
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,879
So, I think as long as you're focusing

762
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,144
on growth and learning,

763
00:24:32,344 --> 00:24:34,039
then you can get to anywhere.

764
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,377
100%.

765
00:24:34,577 --> 00:24:35,319
And I think that

766
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,159
it's even more relevant

767
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,919
when you're thinking,

768
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,428
people often say that,

769
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:40,375
look, somebody else

770
00:24:40,575 --> 00:24:41,261
is already doing this

771
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:43,359
or somebody else is starting off

772
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,919
at a different stage than I am.

773
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,599
And it's not about

774
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,639
the stage of starting off.

775
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,279
It's a marathon.

776
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,079
It's not a sprint.

777
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,119
It's about how,

778
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,999
it's about the slope,

779
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,119
the slope of your trajectory,

780
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,437
not about the starting point

781
00:24:53,637 --> 00:24:54,519
that's both takes over

782
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,199
very, very quickly.

783
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,159
Valentin, thank you very, very much.

784
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,799
Enjoy your time

785
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,079
in Los Angeles with Cliff.

786
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,239
Stay safe and stay healthy.

787
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,480
And thank you for being on the show.

788
00:25:04,481 --> 00:25:05,680
Thank you, Michael,

789
00:25:05,686 --> 00:25:07,086
Thank you for hosting.

790
00:25:07,286 --> 00:25:08,286
Take care.
