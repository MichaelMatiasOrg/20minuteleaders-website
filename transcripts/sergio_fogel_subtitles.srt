1
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,000
Wonderful. Okay.

2
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,120
Sergio Fogel, thank you so much

3
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,000
for being on my show.

4
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,800
Good afternoon.

5
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,360
Good afternoon. Good morning for me.

6
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,120
Good morning.

7
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,200
Yeah. So, how are you?

8
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,120
I mean, you're in Uruguay now.

9
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,600
How is everything with covid?

10
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,600
Oh, this is like an island.

11
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,320
We have very very few cases.

12
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:59,120
Not a single person right now in hospital.

13
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,680
Wow. Okay.

14
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,400
That's amazing.

15
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,960
Okay. So, what I love about this

16
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,800
is that, this is actually

17
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,960
going to be showed in a few weeks.

18
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,440
So, this is always a fun test

19
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,480
to see how things are now.

20
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,400
And then in a few weeks

21
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,960
when this gets  published to our page,

22
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,600
we're gonna see what actually happens.

23
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,800
But let's be optimistic

24
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,640
and see that everything is fine.

25
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,680
I'm going to bet that when this show is aired

26
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,320
we have zero cases.

27
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,480
Incredible.

28
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,640
Funnily enough, or actually not funny.

29
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,400
Pretty sad.

30
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,040
I had a show

31
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,560
with an entrepreneur from Israel

32
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,200
about a month and a half ago

33
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,080
when there were zero cases.

34
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:32,920
And he said,

35
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,240
"Yeah, everything is fantastic."

36
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,000
"It's great."

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,680
And then I said,

38
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,400
"Well, let's wait and see what happens."

39
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,440
And the show is gonna air this week.

40
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,440
And the first sentence is that

41
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,080
and I say it on the show.

42
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,280
Well, let's be optimistic.

43
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,120
But obviously we know

44
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,480
what's happening in Israel now.

45
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,520
So, we're gonna give it another try.

46
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,640
Sergio, I want to spend as much time

47
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,840
as we can talking about emerging markets.

48
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:57,880
You're an expert in digital, in FinTech.

49
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,560
And you're one of the most renowned

50
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,800
innovators and entrepreneurs

51
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
of Uruguay and Latin America.

52
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,680
A limited partner at J-Ventures,

53
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,000
where we work together.

54
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,640
So much is going on.

55
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,440
You're dealing with

56
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,520
one of the most incredible industries

57
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,080
and one of the most fascinating industries

58
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:14,000
because you're actually dealing with

59
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,280
revolutionizing people's lives in the way

60
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,800
they interact with businesses and consumers.

61
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,120
I traveled to Mexico last year

62
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,480
with one of my best friends from Stanford.

63
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,080
I noticed how the credit card revolution

64
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,400
and digital banking revolution

65
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,080
is just starting out.

66
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,440
It was incredible.

67
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,640
Please tell me a little bit more about you

68
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,000
and what is dLocal?

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,840
Okay. So, where do I start?

70
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,960
Let me first tell you a bit about myself.

71
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,400
I was born here in Uruguay.

72
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,080
I [--]

73
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,960
I wanted to live in Israel

74
00:04:47,961 --> 00:04:52,320
when I was 20 years old.

75
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,560
Study tech in Technion.

76
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,680
Worked for IBM.

77
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,000
Then, I went to do my MBA

78
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:04,160
at INSEAD in France.

79
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,760
Very international school.

80
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,640
Yeah.

81
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,520
And then for family reasons,

82
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,120
we wanted our kids to grow

83
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,120
near their grandparents.

84
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,800
So, with my wife, we decided

85
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,280
it was very very tough decision.

86
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,040
We decided to move back to Uruguay.

87
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,840
But we felt all the time

88
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,320
very very attached to Israel

89
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,320
where we lived for almost 10 years.

90
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,240
And because of INSEAD,

91
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,480
we were always very very international.

92
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,320
We just love to travel.

93
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,480
And these two are really

94
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,480
different people and cultures and so.

95
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,840
Yeah.

96
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:37,920
So, after us team,

97
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,600
working for a large companies,

98
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,360
we set up our first venture together.

99
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,640
My wife and myself.

100
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,600
So, I'm going to give you

101
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,800
one big piece of advice,

102
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,640
never do a company with your wife

103
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,400
or a loved one.

104
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,720
Because you put too much at risk.

105
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,160
It was a very very bad idea.

106
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,240
I've heard that quite a few times.

107
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,960
Don't mix the two things.

108
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,320
Also with best friends.

109
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,120
Don't start a company

110
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,040
with your best friend.

111
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,560
That's a good idea.

112
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,120
So, first company was a failure.

113
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,160
Then my second one,

114
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,040
it was a telecom company,

115
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,680
voice over IP Company.

116
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,960
Which we started back in the year 2000.

117
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,680
It's still running very very small

118
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,920
because who we use as voice over IP.

119
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,080
We did a long distance

120
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,320
international phone calls.

121
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:37,320
So, I guess no one does international

122
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,240
phone calls anymore.

123
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:43,480
And then 12 years ago

124
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:46,440
we started AstroPay,

125
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,680
which from that company,

126
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:51,800
we spun off a dLocal.

127
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,080
But before you tell me what these are,

128
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,760
I want you to tell me a little bit

129
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,880
about the market.

130
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,560
Latin America,

131
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,600
hundreds of millions of people.

132
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,480
Coming from Israel

133
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,680
and from North America,

134
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,960
it's a different market.

135
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,280
It's a different lifestyle,

136
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,560
different mentality.

137
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,120
What is happening in terms of FinTech

138
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,920
and the way consumers are interacting

139
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,760
with small businesses

140
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,480
up until AstroPay

141
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,080
and dlocal come into the market?

142
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:23,400
Okay. So, first of all,

143
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,680
you need to take into account that

144
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,000
there is not a country

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
called Latin America.

146
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:32,080
It is very very different.

147
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,960
You go to Brazil

148
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,120
that you have one country.

149
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,960
You go to Colombia,

150
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,200
it's a completely different country.

151
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,280
You go to Argentina's, it's completely

152
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,480
different country and regulations.

153
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:40,840
Right.

154
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,000
And when we talk about FinTech,

155
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,640
a regulator spirit

156
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,000
play a very very big part.

157
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:46,880
Of course.

158
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,680
So, you go to Brazil and you'll find that

159
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,600
almost everybody has a credit card

160
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,560
or a debit card.

161
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,600
But you go to some other countries

162
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,720
and you see that

163
00:07:57,721 --> 00:08:00,960
credit card penetration is quite low.

164
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,520
Right.

165
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,800
Now, something that is quite common

166
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,760
to all of these markets,

167
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,480
not only these markets.

168
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,160
We also work in countries

169
00:08:08,161 --> 00:08:13,800
like India or Indonesia or Africa.

170
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,120
Something that happens is that

171
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,640
you see many many countries  where

172
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,280
a credit card penetration is very low,

173
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,920
and they are completely leapfrogging

174
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,040
their credit card

175
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,640
and going straight to wallets.

176
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,600
Straight to  digital wallets.

177
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,320
Yes.

178
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,760
Yes.

179
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,320
So, the biggest case,

180
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,560
a greatest example, is actually China.

181
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,280
You go to China.

182
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,640
I was there a late last year

183
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:44,760
and nobody is carrying a wallet anymore.

184
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,560
So people, it's the mobile phone.

185
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,360
You go to a restaurant,

186
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,840
you pay scanning your QR code.

187
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,920
You go to a store,

188
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,760
again, it's WeChat Pay everywhere.

189
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,960
Yeah.

190
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,760
Maybe AliPay.

191
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,960
But it's all,

192
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:04,280
Incredible. Yeah.

193
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:09,000
Now,  the pain that we come to solve

194
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:12,480
is that all these people with this,

195
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,680
actually all of those countries

196
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,720
they have some preferred payment method

197
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,280
because everybody is paying.

198
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,400
And in many cases,

199
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,880
people are going out of,

200
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,760
I will go away from cash.

201
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,640
Yeah.

202
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,280
In some places,

203
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,600
people pay scanning a QR code.

204
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,080
In some places they give

205
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,160
a debit card, a credit card.

206
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,120
In many many cases it's a credit card,

207
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,000
but it's not Visa or MasterCard branded.

208
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,200
So, you go to Argentina,

209
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,920
you have many people with card

210
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,040
called [--].

211
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,760
If you go to Mexico and people pay

212
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,400
with them with cash,

213
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,160
they like to go also and pay cash.

214
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,320
You go to India,

215
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,120
you have all they say E-wallets.

216
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:01,520
It's all good for the consumers

217
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,920
because the local businesses

218
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,280
accept those payment methods.

219
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,040
But when an international merchant goes,

220
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,960
we call merchant to actually

221
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,400
anyone who accepts payments.

222
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:14,640
Right.

223
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,760
Our company at once

224
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,280
we sell into these markets

225
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,920
and we have to go

226
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,560
in very very big markets.

227
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,240
You go and you sell into those markets

228
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,000
and you find that people either

229
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,880
do not want to pay with a credit card

230
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,560
if they have it,

231
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,160
or they cannot pay.

232
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,880
So, let's give you

233
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,960
another classic example.

234
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,880
You have the Ridesharing service

235
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,640
who wants to penetrate into a market,

236
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:39,170
let's say, into a country in Latin America

237
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,760
that there is a very low penetration

238
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,920
of credit cards or something of that sort.

239
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,320
And all of a sudden they're stuck

240
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:49,040
because they are used to getting payments

241
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,480
through your credit card.

242
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,640
And if the country

243
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,520
doesn't have credit card,

244
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,240
then it doesn't matter

245
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,680
that you have the drivers and the cars

246
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,480
because you can't accept the payments.

247
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,000
And then here you are coming in

248
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,560
and you're saying,

249
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,480
"Okay, let's think of a creative way

250
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,320
to bridge this gap between

251
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,200
the local and international."

252
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,160
Exactly. You nailed it right in the middle.

253
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,560
So, that was a great example.

254
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,769
When Uber came,

255
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,720
it was the first Ridesharing company

256
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
to come to the region.

257
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,920
They came and they saw that

258
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,960
most people couldn't pay.

259
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,560
So, many people went to the bank

260
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,560
and they got their first credit card.

261
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,880
Many of them got debit cards.

262
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,360
But then what you find is that

263
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:34,760
debit cards in most of these places

264
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,880
are not enabled for e-commerce.

265
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,200
So, then we came in and what we did was

266
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,760
we enabled Uber both to accept payments

267
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:51,080
from the riders and also to,

268
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,440
But also pay the drivers, right?

269
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,600
Also pay the drivers. Yes.

270
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,920
And also accept payments from the drivers.

271
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,960
Because what happened was that

272
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:01,000
at one point we said,

273
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:03,760
"Okay, let's allow the drivers

274
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,440
to accept cash payments."

275
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,640
Okay.

276
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,120
So, I think the very first place

277
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,160
where they try it to,

278
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,880
I may be wrong, but I think it was Peru.

279
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:16,320
In Peru, you could pay the driver in cash.

280
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,000
But then at the end of the week,

281
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,720
the payments was reversed.

282
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,040
Instead of paying the driver,

283
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,000
you need to collect

284
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,600
the commission from the driver.

285
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,600
Incredible how similar services

286
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,960
have to make these adaptations

287
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:32,720
for the local culture norms

288
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:34,360
that they have.

289
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,120
Because here in,

290
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,240
imagining in California going into an Uber

291
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,600
and trying to pay them in cash,

292
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,120
it's unheard of.

293
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,160
What happened was that

294
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:48,600
the moment they started accepting cash,

295
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,240
the sales are actually,

296
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,840
the rise went through the roof.

297
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,880
Of course.

298
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:57,640
And sometimes in many many cases,

299
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,680
it's a very big differentiator.

300
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,240
You want to accept more payment methods.

301
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,560
So, it's a competitive advantage

302
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,040
against your competitor.

303
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,120
But how does dLocal

304
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,080
actually make that adjustment?

305
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,920
How do you mitigate between the two sides?

306
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,080
So, let's say you go to Peru or Uruguay

307
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,240
or some other country

308
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:23,720
and Uber wants to come in,

309
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:26,120
low credit card penetration,

310
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,520
how do you deal with that?

311
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:29,360
Okay, first of all,

312
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,600
we are integrated today

313
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,520
with over 300 different payment methods.

314
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,280
Wow. I didn't know there are so many.

315
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,839
Sorry?

316
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,320
I didn't know

317
00:13:39,321 --> 00:13:41,400
there are so many payment methods.

318
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:42,120
There are more.

319
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,880
There are more.

320
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:46,600
So, each one of our customers,

321
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,560
our customer called the merchants,

322
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,960
which is the companies.

323
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,120
They decide which type of payment methods

324
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,360
they want to accept.

325
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,840
Of course, there are different fees

326
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,840
for different payment methods.

327
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,640
So, you have a different networks

328
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,840
and local credit and debit cards

329
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,680
and fund transfers and more of it.

330
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,920
And there are literally thousands.

331
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:12,560
So, when they go into a market,

332
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,360
we work together.

333
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,040
We have a team of what we call

334
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,200
technical account managers

335
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,600
that are engineers that work together

336
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,280
with the customer and we decide

337
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:23,280
what is the best integration to use.

338
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,640
What is the best payment method

339
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:28,320
for each particular customer.

340
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,920
For instance, if you are a Netflix,

341
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,560
It is a subscription model.

342
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,400
So, you want a payment method

343
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,480
that you can pull money from the accounts.

344
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,720
You don't want the person

345
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
to opt to go and pay with cash.

346
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,560
Maybe you do want,

347
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,200
but if you want the customer to pay in cash,

348
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,920
maybe you want to charge them

349
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,880
every three months instead of every month.

350
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,400
Right.

351
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,800
You need to find that.

352
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,720
And it's very important

353
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,000
that we actually know

354
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,960
each one of those markets.

355
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,240
We have people on the ground

356
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,760
in each one of the countries

357
00:14:59,761 --> 00:15:01,760
that we serve.

358
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,400
You're saying you have people

359
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,640
on the ground in each of these countries.

360
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,720
So, how many people are involved

361
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,360
with dLocal right now?

362
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,880
We are around 280 people now.

363
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,400
Wow.

364
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,880
We're growing very fast.

365
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,240
We'll be over 500 there by next year.

366
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,920
By next year?

367
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,320
Yes.

368
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,400
That's incredible.

369
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,920
Okay. So, now the  given question is

370
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,880
what is it like to run

371
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,040
such a fast growing company

372
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,320
at emerging markets?

373
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,360
I mean, during covid most people are firing.

374
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,160
You're doubling your size within a year.

375
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,680
Yeah. Since covid started we've hired,

376
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,200
I don't remember the exact number,

377
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,800
probably around 30 people.

378
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,680
It's very challenging to bring people in

379
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,360
when you cannot be face to face with them

380
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,040
Of course.

381
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,840
The culture, it is hard.

382
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,920
For me it's very easy because

383
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,960
I'm no longer a CEO of the company.

384
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,280
We have a CEO who is much younger.

385
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,120
He lives in Israel, by the way.

386
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,720
But it is very very challenging.

387
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:10,040
We have lots of very young people.

388
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,040
Our CEO is I believe 29 years old

389
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,080
I'm not sure if he's 30 yet.

390
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,200
But isn't it challenging

391
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,480
that the leadership team has to,

392
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,080
when you're thinking

393
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,520
of a new market to enter

394
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,200
or the new adaptations you have to make

395
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,880
to different emerging markets.

396
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,040
You have to really understand

397
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,680
their culture.

398
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,040
You have to be sort of,

399
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,640
you need to be local, right?

400
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,160
dLocal, you need to be local

401
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,360
to that market.

402
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,320
So, how do you mitigate this,

403
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,840
the fact that the leadership team

404
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,040
perhaps is from Israel or is like from

405
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,880
different places in the world,

406
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,440
and all of a sudden

407
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,040
they have to make strategic decisions

408
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,360
based on an emerging market

409
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,440
that they don't necessarily

410
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,840
empathize with?

411
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,760
We traveled a lot.

412
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,080
We have local people.

413
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,760
Probably the most

414
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,040
challenging market for us,

415
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,040
we say China actually.

416
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:00,080
And what we did in Chinese,

417
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,080
we recruited a team over there.

418
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,720
Of course, we started with one key person.

419
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,360
But we recruited a team

420
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:10,350
of around 15 people.

421
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,310
And we sent a few people

422
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,400
that were working with us for a long time

423
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,070
which are living in China.

424
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,000
So, we try to mix the company culture

425
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,510
with the local culture.

426
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,640
So, they both worked together.

427
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,680
It's not easy. This is quite a challenging.

428
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,160
But again, we need to have,

429
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,040
we do have local people

430
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,200
in each one of the markets.

431
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Because that's the only way

432
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,440
that we can really understand

433
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:35,920
the markets.

434
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,270
Amazing. Okay.

435
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,110
And we get together once a year

436
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,760
with all the team and

437
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:46,310
we work very hard

438
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,310
on the character and interaction

439
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,000
between the people.

440
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,640
Okay. Sergio, talked to me

441
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,200
a little bit about

442
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,800
entrepreneurship and innovation

443
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,270
in Latin America.

444
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,720
What is the scene like?

445
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,830
Where is it headed?

446
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,920
And what are some of the most

447
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,240
exciting opportunities that

448
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:02,720
I could be excited about

449
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,270
as a young entrepreneur?

450
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,960
Let's say, if I want to enter this market

451
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,830
and to make an impact,

452
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,040
a good impact on the market as a whole.

453
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,760
Well, first of all,

454
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,240
I'm a very firm believer

455
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,480
that entrepreneurship is,

456
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,680
It's everywhere.

457
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,110
And actually,

458
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,480
the more challenging the environment,

459
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,000
the more entrepreneurship you have.

460
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,720
You go to, I don't know,

461
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,030
you go to places like India, for example.

462
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,590
And everybody needs to be entrepreneur

463
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,360
because otherwise,

464
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:37,560
even I would love doing

465
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,830
some basic tasks

466
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,000
that in the US are so simple,

467
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,920
requires you to be creative

468
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,240
and find your way to work.

469
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,550
Definitely.

470
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,440
So, I think that entrepreneurship

471
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,160
and innovation happens everywhere.

472
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,720
It's no longer something

473
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,280
that comes out of Silicon Valley.

474
00:18:55,281 --> 00:18:59,400
And they think that post covid

475
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:02,640
after companies got used

476
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,480
to hiring remote.

477
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,960
The moment that your hiring remote,

478
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,200
the border doesn't mean anything anymore.

479
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,640
Nothing.

480
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,400
If you're going to hire a remote,

481
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,310
the person can be sitting in Sunnyvale,

482
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,310
or New York, or in Argentina.

483
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,270
It doesn't matter.

484
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,830
So, you expect this to accelerate

485
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,070
the productivity of the markets

486
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,590
that until now

487
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,760
they didn't have access

488
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,720
to a lot of these companies

489
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,200
because of geography.

490
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,160
Now, the engineers over there

491
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,240
and the people who are able to work in tech,

492
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,600
they can work and they often work

493
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,760
at cheaper prices, right?

494
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,720
Actually, I mean,

495
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,680
doesn't have to be cheaper prices.

496
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,360
But as a company

497
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,400
it opens the whole run.

498
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,920
And there is talent everywhere.

499
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,030
Everywhere, right.

500
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,120
And for every, I don't know,

501
00:19:55,121 --> 00:19:59,520
for every Uruguayan

502
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,040
that is working in the valley,

503
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,420
there are a 10 other Uruguayans

504
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:05,160
that are as talented,

505
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,480
and that they don't want to leave.

506
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,750
No. Of course.

507
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,080
And when I mentioned the cheaper prices,

508
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,040
I meant not only in the sense of,

509
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,200
here the my friends are paying

510
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:21,030
$2500 a month rent plus $20 a meal

511
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,270
three times a day to just to eat.

512
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,550
You go around the world to any place.

513
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,920
It's not the same price.

514
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,030
So, in order to have a similar lifestyle,

515
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,960
you don't need to get

516
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,680
an entrance salary of 130, 140K

517
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:36,680
as an engineer.

518
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,680
Of course. Yeah.

519
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,200
Right.

520
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,240
And so, back to your question.

521
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,000
There are many many exciting things

522
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
happening in Latin America.

523
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,790
FinTech is one of them.

524
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,320
Banks here are very very old fashioned.

525
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:54,720
Very inefficient. And so,

526
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,080
in all the different areas of Fintech,

527
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:58,680
there are many things going on

528
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,920
in payments, in lending,

529
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:05,160
in insurance, you name it,

530
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,350
There are things happening.

531
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,800
Again, as I said before,

532
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,120
in Fintech in particular,

533
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,840
regulators are very key player

534
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,720
in that ecosystem.

535
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,760
So, and they are starting to see

536
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,750
that at the end of the day,

537
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,080
they need to provide consumers

538
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,240
with more options.

539
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
Being careful, of course,

540
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,440
because you want to make sure

541
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,160
that there is no money laundering

542
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,480
or anything bad in bank.

543
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:37,640
So, that's one area.

544
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:40,920
Everything cross-border is super exciting.

545
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,280
I am an investor

546
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,720
in a cross-border e-commerce company.

547
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:49,360
And again, with covid sales are going

548
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,070
through their roof.

549
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,840
It's amazing what's going on

550
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
in that market.

551
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,840
And there are many companies

552
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
that are doing software development

553
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,760
and testing for a current role.

554
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,400
Sorry about that.

555
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,000
No problem.

556
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,400
What else,

557
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:10,400
[--]

558
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,920
There's a lot going on.

559
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:16,880
Essentially you have many many companies

560
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,550
that are clones of US company.

561
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,720
I've seen that as a trend

562
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,550
that a lot of US,

563
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,400
a lot of these emerging markets,

564
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,240
they're looking at this

565
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,120
successful innovations of the US

566
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:30,760
and they are making a local adaptation

567
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,880
of them into their country.

568
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,760
But Sergio, before we leave,

569
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,310
I wanna thank you again for your time.

570
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,110
20 minutes always go by so quickly.

571
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,240
I always learn so much

572
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:42,590
from these incredible conversations.

573
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,320
But I have to ask

574
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,640
the most important question,

575
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,920
which is three words

576
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,360
that you would use to describe yourself.

577
00:22:49,361 --> 00:22:52,680
I would say

578
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:57,160
I'm very Curious.

579
00:22:57,161 --> 00:23:01,240
International.

580
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,520
And Entrepreneur.

581
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,100
I love it.

582
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,350
Curious international entrepreneur.

583
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,440
Sergio, thank you very much

584
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,680
for the inspiration

585
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,000
Thank you for everything

586
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,590
that you've taught me.

587
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,240
And good luck with covid.

588
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,920
And I hope that it will continue

589
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,960
to be zero cases

590
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,550
also when this is published.

591
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,040
I really hope so.

592
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,060
Really really hope so.

593
00:23:21,061 --> 00:23:21,815
Take care

594
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,620
Thank you very much. Bye.

595
00:23:22,621 --> 00:23:24,840
Bye.
