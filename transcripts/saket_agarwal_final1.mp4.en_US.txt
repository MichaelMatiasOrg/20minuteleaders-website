1 Five years ago, we had five unicorns based out of India. Now, we have about 24, and we expect there'll be another 50 unicorns in the next five years. Saket Agarwal, thank you so much for joining me. How are you? I'm awesome. How are you? Fantastic. Are you calling from India right now? Yes, yes. I'm based out of Mumbai. So, you're based out of Mumbai, yet your hashtag is "Your Israel tech guy" right? Yes, yes. Your Israel guy. I'm in Israel. So, this is going to be a lot of fun because I'm going to be learning so much from this call. Besides for the fact that you're an accountant and you're the co ambassador of the Singularity University chapter of Mumbai, you are extremely passionate about the intersection of Israel and in India tech ecosystems. So, this is a world where I know very little about, and I know very little about the India tech ecosystem. And that's why I'm so excited to hear your insights and what's happening today. But before we get into all that, who are you and what is your journey into this tech world? Yeah, thanks, thanks for having me on the show. I'm really excited. So, I started on aviation about five years ago. I'm an accountant by qualification. And the thesis is that every time I went to the US, I would eat at Chipotle or I would sit on a Tesla, and then I would wonder why aren't these companies coming to India. And the natural realization was they would ideally go to the US first because US is the media market to crack. And one fine day I went to Israel and I saw that so many disruptive technologies also going to the US, not looking in India. But Israelis loved Indians because you guys come to India. After the army. So I thought, why not explore this corridor where I identify the most disruptive Israeli SaaS companies, identify their market for India, hire a team, and run their entire business. So, I went for a 17 day trip to Israel. Literally met a hundred companies, so many people. And towards the end I got lucky. I met a company called, Spot.io. Yes. Which was recently acquired by NetApp for $450,000,000. So, Spot essentially helps you optimize your AWS costs by 80%. Being an accountant, it just resonated with me. And I was like, okay, why not explore this. So, I got them to India, hired a bunch of folks to review a decent chunk of the revenue for Spot. Almost all the big e-commerce, media and gaming companies, everyone's a customer. And then we realized, since we have more hundred customers using Spot, how do we sell them everything else? So, over a period of time, we've got a portfolio of 15 Israeli companies. We run their India business. We've hired professional sales folks for them and we're like their extended arm. So, first of all, it's amazing. And I think that on one hand, you're doing a great service to Israeli tech companies. On the other hand, you're doing a great service to the companies in India by bridging this gap. Because obviously, it's a huge win-win. Let's go back to the problem. Why do Israelis and Americans not look at their business to the Indian market? We're talking about more than a billion people. We're talking about potentially, and the glass ceiling is so high you can't even see it in terms of the potential business. To me, it makes perfect sense when I build a business, I want to also go to the India market. Why is it so hard or people don't do it? Yeah. So, the natural answer is, US is a comfort zone for every Israeli, right? You've been there, you've stayed there, you have so many family, and you have so many friends and family members running big corporations in the US ecosystem. So, it's always easier to tap into the US because you are aware. India, on the other hand, is a slightly unknown territory. So, you need a lot of guidance in order to find a greater market. The second thing is, India has a large population, not necessarily a large market for every product, unlike the US. So, what do you want to bring into India has to be very, very well thought to. Does it for the Indian market well or not; will you be able to make a big business out of it or not, is a key question. So, if you are able to scale a hundred companies in the US, the same number would reduce to 10 if you would bring those companies into India if you want to see scale. Interesting. Right? So, that is one of the media reasons when a company is looking at their options, where do they want to expand first. They naturally do it in the US than in India. So, can you give me a little bit of background into the Indian market. What is the tech ecosystem like? Who are the customers? And then what I love to talk about is, maybe understanding a little bit the different cultural habits that maybe hinder the relationships to scale from 10 to 100 companies. Yeah, yeah. So, in terms of the Indian tech landscape, I'll give you some context. Five years ago we had five unicorns based out of India. Now, we have about 24, and we expect there'll be another 50 unicorns in the next five years. So, just to repeat that. So, five years ago, you had five unicorns. That's about the number that Israel had, I guess maybe five, 10 years ago, right, as well. And now, you have 24. And you're expecting to double that in the next five years. Correct. More than double. We expect about a hundred unicorns. So, a couple of things, the digital landscape is really exploding in India right now. So, we've seen like a 100x growth in terms of start up Internet penetration since 2010. All the venture capital funds are now prioritizing India in a big way. To give you context, Sequoia Capital recently raised a big funding round of $1.35 billion, only and only to invest in Indian tech startups. Right? So, suddenly, there's a massive push towards digital adoption, digital transformation. So, the payment infrastructure that India has is actually the most advanced across the world. So, if I were to transfer you money sitting in India, I can do it under 30 seconds using a unique UPI ID, which is linked to your mobile phone. Right. Or if I have to access a doctor, there are several apps that are available that can help me do video consultation or order online medicines right away. We can get food delivery in 30 minutes in such a massive country. Like Mumbai itself is maybe 10x the population of Israelis, but we've been able to handle that scale in a very digital friendly way, very, very successfully. I think that one of the things that I am underestimating and I'm guessing that a lot of people in my community are underestimating is that, having 30-minute food deliveries or a 30-second payment system in a place like Mumbai, which is 10x Israel, that expansion, it makes perfect sense why you may take a little bit longer, but when it gets there, it has to be so much more robust and foundational to be able to handle that scale, right? I mean, we're talking about a massively different problem. And I think that one of the things that I'm understanding and I'm really, when you're talking about this 10x growth and the hundred unicorns in the next few years, I'm surprised that I'm not seeing every headline talk about the amazing things that are coming out of India. Because in my news feed that is tailored for me, I'm seeing the tech ecosystem in Israel, the tech ecosystem in Palo Alto, in Seattle, in New York. But I'm missing out on what sounds like the really the next huge market that is going to be the tech innovator of the world. Absolutely. Absolutely. So, one thing I want to highlight is our strength in India has been B2C, wherein the Israel has been very strong on the B2B side. I miss I think, something last IPL. IPL is Indian Premier League. It's one of the biggest cricketing tournaments in India. The final match had 25,000,000 concurrent users. So, 25,000,000 people were watching the finals of that match at a single point, right, which is a global record. A global record. It's more than the Oscars, the Super Bowl, the [--]. I think so. I think so. I think so. So, we are seeing a lot of scale and that's where we're saying will solve a problem for every individual, a billion and a half people in India. Where we sort of need a lot of help is depth on the technology front, which is where Israel comes into play. You have the best data scientist, the best cybersecurity professionals and the best marketing ad-tech professionals. The industry is very strong there. These companies are scaling so fast. To give you context, the largest fantasy sports platform in India is a company called, Dream11, which is now valued at $2.5 billion. The mass, the media grew this all was in the last two years. Now, the fact that they're scaling so fast, they need the best of data science, best of security, best of QA, the best of cloud infrastructure and monitoring solutions. And that's where they look at Israel, which is really, really strong in these areas. And that's where I see a big synergy between the two countries. So, I'm just trying to synthesize for myself. It sounds like what you're saying is that there has been a great shift in the market in the past few years that tech companies are emerging to provide local solutions to one of the biggest places in the world. So, these are solutions that we've seen already in the Western world five, 10 years ago. They are now being brought into the Indian culture by Indian tech companies. And now there is this weird limbo zone where you still have an opportunity to implement the great technologies from Israel at the scale of India. And there is a win-win. And what's missing there right now is more people like you that are making that connection, right? Absolutely. Absolutely. What is even more interesting is a few Israeli companies were initially very excited about the scale that they would get in the US. They are now surprised by the scale they see in India. You know, 25,000,000 concurrent users is Android and which is also helping the Israeli companies prepare their product for a much, much more higher scale. All these Indian companies become design partners for such startups in Israel. Right. Now, do you have any connection to Israel? Why are you so excited about making this bridge? What got you into this? Yeah. Look, I just landed in Israel, I met a few people, and the love and warmth I got from everyone was incredible. And I just got started with one company and then it just kept on building. I had no real, you know, I'm not even a techie so, for me, cloud was cloud. So, the journey has purely been very, very random. I picked a country I knew nothing about. I did one thing, it became successful. And I said, why not build up on it. And because Israel is such a strong brand, right? When I say I bring US companies into India or European companies into India, there are too many people doing it. With Israel, I was able to build a very strong niche and now I am truly like, one of the leading guys in the tech ecosystem bridging the gap. Wow. And so, what is your method? How do you go about finding the synergy? Because it sounds like you have to have both feet in both places. You have to know what are the new emerging technologies in Israel, and what are the emerging markets and who are the key players that you can now knock on their door and say, hey, you now have the need to supply something to 20,000,000 people, here is a technology that might be able to assist you? Yeah. Yeah. That's a great question, actually. So, first of all, I personally visit Israel every other month. Wow. Yeah. I've built relationships with almost all the big venture capital funds, all the accelerators in Israel. All of them are familiar with our work in India. The kind of success we've generated, and you know how Israelis want to generate success for one company. What we did with Spot, for example, it became very, very popular. So, the moment that a great company that is born, they are saying, okay, you are looking at the US market, why don't you also look at India as a market. So, I can give you a data point. There are three companies that we represent in India today. All of them have raised upwards of $40,000,000 in funding each and we do 20% of their global revenue. Wow. Right. Because of this good word, VCs started connecting us to a company the moment they invest in them. The third thing that I started doing was I personally started investing in these companies. So, I've invested in two venture capital funds as an LP in Israel. That gives me access to the best deal flows. The moment the startup is born I have access to them. And I recently invested in a company called Dataloop, which was backed by a few NDB. I know him well. Eran. Yeah. Yes. It's a great company. And what we're doing is, we're saying, not only will help you sell, but since we're running sales for you, we have so much value. Give us some allocation to co-invest with big VCs. And lastly, I would say, since we have one hundred plus customers and all our customers are the largest e-commerce, media and gaming companies, unicorns, they keep sharing with us. You know, personalization is a big problem, warehouse automation is a big problem. Customer acquisition cost for gaming company are a huge issue. Are there solutions in Israel that are solving it? Some of them even come to Israel with us and we make them meet different companies. So, that's how we get a lot of problem statement. And then I would go to a VC and ask them, you know, is there someone in Israel solving this? And someone in Israel is always solving some problem on the other for sure. And I could assume very well that if you come with an actual problem that somebody needs a solution for, even if there is not a solution now, there will be somebody who is willing to pick up the glove and to do the right thing. Correct. Correct. So, I love thinking ahead and imagining what type of world we're going to be living in. Obviously this past year has been very monumental for me and thinking about what are the different things that are going to change, and how do I need to adapt as an entrepreneur and as an engineer to this changing world due to covid. But I'm curious now about the Indian tech ecosystem and Israelis tech ecosystem. If you're looking five, 10 years down the line, what changes, what shifts are we going to see perhaps also, with the US market in this whole triangle? What big developments can I look for as I'm now venturing into my own journey? Yeah. A couple of very interesting thoughts. One, I feel your digital online identity and how you present yourself digitally would become so much more important than anything else. Right? Because, you know, now we are in a situation we  don't know when the vaccine is actually going to come and when the world will  start seeing each other, when travel will open. So, that window all the networking that we used to do at conferences, meet and greet things, everything's moving online. So, you got to be very, very good at how you communicate, how you think, and how you position yourself digitally. So that's going to be a big, big shift going forward. Then a lot of shift that we will also see in the way people use essential services. So, for example, health care, food or any services that we are using on a day to day basis, a lot of that is going to move digital. Instead of going to a physical diagnostic center, can you do everything at home. So, I'm seeing a massive shift there. And that's where, you know, the fact that India has a massive consumer base and Israel is building these technologies. I think there's a lot of synergy that I see on that front as well. I think that all of that sounds incredibly exciting. I have to say that I can't believe that I know so little about this emerging market, because it's obviously this is the future. And I think that any entrepreneur needs to understand what are the emerging markets that are possible. And I'm extremely excited to continue this conversation also in a professional setting with whatever companies I'll be building and working together on finding the synergy and the solutions to both markets. Because it just sounds like this is where we're headed and you can either be a part of it or you can ignore it and lose. You lose out on something so meaningful. With this, I really want to thank you for being so generous with your time and all the incredible insights and knowledge that you've shared. But before we leave, I have to ask you for three words that you would use to describe yourself. Your Israel guy. If you are on Twitter, please follow me and spread the good word of the work we're doing between India-Israel. I think it's great opportunity for everyone to tap into. Wonderful. Looking forward to being in touch. And obviously whoever has a company and has some interesting technologies and solutions, I'm sure that they, that they can reach reach out to you and share with you what they're working on, right? Absolutely, absolutely. Feel free to reach out to me. Wonderful. Thank you very much for joining me. This is a lot of fun. Thank you.
