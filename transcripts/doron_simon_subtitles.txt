Doron Simon,  Thank you so much for being on 20 Minute Leaders. So gracious of you. Yeah. Thanks for having me. So, we know each other through a J-Ventures, the wonderful and early stage venture capital firm here in Silicon Valley. A capitalistic Kibbutz. You're very recently a venture partner there. In the screening committee. But besides that, you have a ton of experience working with two incredible public companies on growth and strategy. Tower Semiconductor and NICE. And I'd love to spend this episode talking about just that. Strategy and growth. And sort of the back scenes of what drives these companies to success. I love to share my experiences with that. With that opening. Incredible. So, Doron let's just start. Give me a little bit about yourself. Like where are you from? What excites you? How do you even get to do what you did? So I grew up in Israel, as you can detect from the accent. I moved here as part of the Tower Semiconductor. When Silicon Valley was still about silicon and semiconductors. And this was around 2001. Did Silicon Valley,  was it actually mainly about chips and silicon? It was all about chips. A while back and not too far. Oh, now I get it. Only three years later. Okay. Amazing. So, this is after the standard career army and then going to study the  tech. then starting some jobs in tech. And over here, I spend some time running Tower USA. As President and V.P. Marketing. And also in between Tower and Nice, I had a stint as a consultant for six years with early stage companies. I've worked quite a bit with the go to market strategies for early stage companies of all types. Right. Okay. And just very quickly, go to market strategy into words. What what does that mean for you? So, for the early stage stuff, it's something that many of the companies have typically a need, or they recognize the need. But they don't have a defined product necessarily. Or define how you sell it, how you package it. What is the product? Is it a service? Is it something tangible? So, even if they build a product, there is not necessarily a strategy of how do you get this product to fulfill this need. We call it Product/market fit in the textbooks. But it's a phase where you have to share what you think with potential customers and get feedback. And at least hone on your first version. The minimum viable product. With software, it's easier. It's very easy to set up and test. When you involve the hardware or things that are developed in the physical world. It's much tougher. So, I did a lot of the both more complicated machines typically. Okay. And then, how do you go from that to  growth strategy, M&A? Because that's really the next part of the life cycle of a startup, right? Yeah. So the way I look at it, probably strategy and M&As are the least discussed realities in the you call it venture ecosystem. When you look at it from the startup side, I'll start with that. Statistically, most startups would end their life in, as part of the M&A. If they are lucky, a very few actually make it all the way to an IPO and many fall on the way. But M&A is a big piece of the outcome of a startup. And startups don't gear up and don't build themselves towards an M&A. And there is a basically an art to how you do it right. We'll leave that for later. From a company that is a established point of view. Once you've crossed a certain threshold, and this is typically an already multi-million dollar type revenue. So, call it 10, 15, 20. And you start to grow. There's quite a bit of runway, which you could do by focusing on what you set up the company to do initially. Right. And then starts to be a more strategic approach of growth that could be coming out of outside of your core. How do you accelerate? How do you address non-coring? Their features or markets? How do you respond to market changes? How do you had risks? And you get to the more creative side of business development, which is either a partnership, strategic partnerships, core development, and eventually M&As And in M&As, you're either being acquired or being the acquirer. Hold on. This is really complicated. Because what you're essentially saying is let's look at the life-cycle of a startup or starting out. We're running the company. We're controlling the product. We're the ones selling it. And then we reach a point in time where we are making enough revenues that 10, 15, 20 million. And we have to start making these creative decisions of how do we position ourselves as key players? And how do we collaborate and work with potentially other key players, either as partnerships, mergers or acquisitions. Right. So that is the interesting phase of mind switch. We're not alone in this. Now we're in the big players league. And we can actually work with others. And provide value to others. Yeah, that's exactly right. The threshold could vary quite a bit. So it could happen in 15. And it could be happening 150. But in order to cross the billion, the two companies that have had my longest career runs, we are at one and a half billion dollar run rate. Right. Get to the billion league And this is in sales. Not in valuation. It's not the unicorn billion. It's the actual sales. Revenue generating sales. Per year? Can get a little bit more than just your initial momentum. So you mean that was a billion and a half yearly revenue? Yeah. That's insane. So, you were essentially helping lead growth and strategy in two companies that are public. And they're generating over a billion dollars in revenue a year. So, not their market cap is a billion, but they're generating a billion in revenue. Which means you have a lot of things you can do. Yeah. And that's where you come in. And that's where we come in. So you generate cash typically. You get out of the cash starvation mode. Right. But you still need to use it wisely. And you need to make sure that every dollar you invest brings you much more than that dollar worth in future returns. What is that role? Strategy and growth. How do even work study for that and prepare for that? So, there is no official title for it. Many MBAs  would eventually end up doing pieces of that. But the role is basically something that you develop within big corporations. There's no playbook or school to go to. Besides gaining experience. And essentially every CEO, or business leader that is taking a company, to that journey of a billion dollar company, comes across the need for that. How you do it is different. How you do it could vary from one company to another in a substantial way. So, you want to get it right? But you want to get a right standing at the core. What is your market? What is your strength? And in very realistic assessment, what you're missing and what you can get better outside, which is the first box, that's what they call the easy out, And when I say easy, it's still hardwork. Yeah. You need to remember that for every M&A that happens out there, there's probably a 10, 15 or 20 that you looked at. And you passed for various reasons before you decide to pull the plug on the single M&A in the corporate. And then comes the hard part, which is the execution. The integration into a big company. There's a lot of aspects to consider. When you integrate cultural, work environments. Just different lexicon, different lingo. Though you may be in the same market. A lot of little details that are basically are plan to guarantee that the M&As eventually successful statistically. Give me give me a couple of those earned secrets from your experience in watching M&As and different deals come about? Because a lot of them are not successful. Right? We hear all the time of these different acquisitions who turned out: the technologies didn't integrate, and the cultures were too different, or maybe financially it was just didn't make sense. How can we even start to evaluate ahead of time whether an M&A will be successful or not? So, first statistics in the big world works against you. It's similar to startups. Really? Most M&As fail? Yeah. Depends whose book you read. But statistically beyond 50% fail. Or don't achieve their original targets. Wow. And it does take a lot of discipline and a lot of planning to do it right. I believe that also, you have to consider the post merger activities with a lot of what you call EQ. Emotional IQ. And treat people in a way that basically shows them the way in joining a bigger company. As a career opportunity, rather the end of the journey. And a lot of the startups are triggered by the fact that when they sell out, it's the end of the journey. As opposed to a start of a new journey, which is where some of the benefits could be reaped by the bigger company. So, unless you buy technology, if you want to buy a business and continue to operate and grow it, you have to keep the team motivated. You have to get them into your family. And you have to learn how to leverage each other's strength, which is a very in a way, it's a tough process for every human being. It's like switching families. Well, I mean, And you see the, a lot of different streams. You see some companies after they perform an acquisition, they keep the other company as a separate entity. Completely maintaining their culture and their DNA. You see others that are absorbing them and bring them directly into their offices. And you know, change your, From now on you're company X before you are Y. Is there now an insight into how do you do that best? Or is it a case by case basis really? To me, and this is coming from a company that did M&As at the rate of, let's call it an average of three or four a year. There is no playbook per se. Just the case for the company. And it's also a case of the acquirer. Who is the business owner that gets to run the acquisition? And, you know, ideally, you can buy something and run it as a standalone company If everything is perfect. But it's not the only playbook. If you're talking about serial acquirers, people like Cisco, The Times, Oracle, Salesforce. They're more operating based on playbooks. And completety the story, that is just the sheer numbers. But again, I do feel that when you do a major acquisition, when you go into something that is transformational, and I've done, I was involved in something like that. at NICE. You have to prepare its own playbook. You can't just open a generic one and say, this is my way. Interesting. I want to go a little bit back to growth. Because now I'm asking for some personal tips. I wish for myself that I'll get to a position sooner rather than later. That I grow a startup that that has made a positive impact, has generated revenue. And now I'm at a position as in a leadership role where I can now leverage my new cash flow to grow the company and to think more broadly about how do we become a key player. What are some of the key challenges or opportunities for a young entrepreneur who has never experienced this before? You have a lot of CEOs that all of a sudden fall into as they have soft spot from that generates a lot of revenue. And now they have to make these strategic decisions. So, how can I best position myself when I get to that position, if I get to that position, to make the right decision? So, it is quite mundane. When you talk about strategy, there's a clear way of working out a strategy. It starts with the analyzing your strengths and weaknesses. And what are the growth areas you want to aim. You talk to customers all the time. This is something a CEO knows very well how to do. And when you talk to customers and actually listen to them. Not just talk to them And a startup CEO by the way, they talk first because they are used to selling more and educating the market than you think. At a certain point in time, you have to start to listen and pick up clues. What's missing in features? What's missing in complementary products? I've seen this company doing a great job that works together with your product side by side. Maybe you want to talk to them to see if you can cooperate. You have to be very attentive to clues like that in order to develop that what they call non-organic strategy. And start to address. You have to know your market. You have to know the ecosystem. You have to know what your competitors are doing. And the role of that strategy  function or business development function is to connect all of these inputs. And run them into one coherent strategy and plan. Okay. So it's not just going with your co-founders to the beach. Over a weekend on a retreat. And then talking about some startup. I'm kidding, of course. But that's what they show in the movies at least. Doron,  I also want to talk, because you are coming from Israel. And one of the things that a lot of people are are saying, the startup nation is fantastic. And there's so many great, great companies. And I've also heard of the term Exit Nation Roll around a few times. And it seems like there is sort of a different mentality, especially when it comes to this growth and M&A stage between a lot of Israeli companies and companies that are founded and based in the US. Do you also see some difference? Or is there any difference in mindset in that regard? I think there is a difference of mindset. And there are many factors that could be attributed to that. But first, there is a change. In the recent years, you're seeing more companies break that one billion dollar in sense ceiling . And getting to be more common that things like that would would happen. But there is also an ecosystem that you need to work with. When you do those M&As and strategic moves. And this is something that could involve bankers and investors access to capital. And sometimes in the Israeli ecosystem. It's a very local community. They don't think as much about that piece of the growth as the U.S. oriented bankers and financial ecosystem around companies. So, it's not a Israeli mentality thing per se. You've got a lot of very good Israeli founders that do it here in a different way. But the Israeli ecosystem, I don't think it is developed yet enough to address all of these auxiliary needs. Okay. So, you're thinking about in the realm of the Israeli ecosystem. Which is, you know, because you need a lot of moving players to get to a growth mindset in terms of your ability. To actually grow a company to that level and get to an M&A. And it's more about the maturity of all the players around. Not just the founders themselves. Absolutely. And you've got very sophisticated set of VCs which have that 10 to 12 years runway mentality. And somebody needs to take it from there. This is typically their private equities or bankers. Or other pieces of that ecosystem. Fascinating. And this is just also, It sounds like there's so many moving pieces and it's so much more complicated than just this this young and hardy notion of, let's just create a company and grow it to be a billion dollars. No, you actually get to real stuff that you have to consider a lot of moving pieces. And it's not just about the founder. It's not just about the company. It's also about your whole market and where you position it. Doron, what excites you? You see so many companies. You worked with so many. What really excites you on the day to day? So, first every time I see a new founder with a new idea that kind of resonates with me, it excites. It get you energized. Just because you just identify with what they're creating or about to create. Besides that, I love to see a plan comes through. Okay. I love to see a plan that you put four or five or six years ago and all of a sudden you look back and say, "It actually worked." It was a playbook. And this is something that is very very satisfying and exciting . I'm sure. And besides that, the deal,. Every time you're involved in a deal, that's an exciting phase. How many how many exciting deals would you say you've been involved with over the years? I would say, it's probably not so far 30. North of 30 deals? Yes. Some of them are small. Some of them are bigger. But yeah. Doron, what's small? What's a small deal? Small could be an acquisition that is an acquihire or technology acquisition that you do just for tuck in. Typically you don't hear about those. Those are the typical quiet ones. And some of them could be much much bigger. Much more involved. Much more complicated. I'm sure. Well, you know. Doron, just to give context. I mean, the majority of people in the tech industry, especially entrepreneurs and tech executives, wish they would be a part of a single great deal throughout their lives. So, just listening to you, I'm getting so much insight and seeing you've gone through more than 30 deals. Whether they're big or small, I mean, that's just so inspiring. Doron, we only have just a few minutes left. But I love to ask this last question to everybody. And I'd love to know three words that you would best use to describe yourself. I'm especially curious, I hear from people of all industries. So, what are your three words? Three words. One for sure would be Foresight, Foresight. What does that mean? Explain. Being able to look ahead. Okay. Behind the curve. So, foresight, I would say you have to have tenacity to last in this industry. Do what I do. And the underrated one of all is team player. I think that's critical to be a team player. You mentioned right before we started the call that one of the things that you are very proud of is that a lot of the great successes you've been a part of is not necessarily that you had to be, you know, the founder, the leader. But you sometimes you were the guy in the back behind the scenes. That was really thinking things through and allowing for the great deals to happen. But at the end, you're a team player. That's how you identify yourself, which I think is beautiful. Yeah. A lot of the business development guys are in the shadows for many, many reasons. But I have met over my career some great ones, and they're all able to foresee and execute. I love it. Doron, thank you so much for the time. Thank you for the inspiration. And I'm just going to have to see you around in the J-Ventures meetings. I can't wait to see us face to face again. Thank you. Take care.
