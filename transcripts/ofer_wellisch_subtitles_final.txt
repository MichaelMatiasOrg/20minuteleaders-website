Wonderful. Ofer Wellisch, thank you for being with me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? Good. Thanks for having me, Michael. One of the things that we said right before this is I love the design of your home, the light bulbs especially. I think they're fantastic. Really fabulous. Well, I had nothing to do with it. Sounds great. Ofer, you're calling me from New York. So first of all, thank you for taking the call so late. I really appreciate it. And you're chief division of pain medicine at Stamford Health, right? But you were also an attending physician at Stanford. A limited partner at J- Ventures. So, I'm really curious to hear about, you know you have one leg in medicine, as a doctor another leg as an investor in MedTech. And I'd love to allude eventually also to what's happening today with covid and how you're seeing this unfold as we go along. So Ofer, take us on your journey. I want to go back to Tel Aviv University, studying medicine. What is it like? Do you know that you're gonna be passionate about pain medicine throughout your life? Some great questions there. A lot of questions. Yeah. So actually, when I was a master's student at GW, prior to medical school, I had done my thesis, my master's thesis, at the National Institute of Health. And I got in touch with the lab that was studying molecular pain and molecular neuroscience. And this is a really great growth opportunity for me. The intramural program in Bethesda, Maryland for the NIH is just a wonderful place to just meet great mentors, get a lot of, get your hands on a lot of different experimental techniques in medicine, and just also meet a lot of personalities that have been very successful in medicine. And so from there, I went on to medical school, and I always kind of kept really good communication with my mentors and the whole concept of pain medicine and some of the concepts we had been working on. So wait Ofer. What is pain medicine? Just for background really quick, what is pain medicine? Right. So, we could talk a little bit about chronic pain, and pain medicine is essentially the practice of treating pain. And evolutionarily, acute pain has a purpose. So, if a person back in the old times injured themselves, they'd go back to their cave so the lion doesn't eat them, for example. So, pain served a protective purpose. Right? Today, we have what's called chronic pain. So, patients get injured, whether it's at work or in a sporting incident. Their injuries actually heal, yet they maintain, they still have some level of chronic pain. Now chronic means a lifetime, that this is a permanent pain that you're going to experience if not treated, right? Or that there is no treatment. So, there are various different treatments. Chronic pain is defined as three to six months or more, right. So, there's plasticity in the nervous system and there's gene regulation and so forth that occurs on the nerve level, on the spinal cord level, and also on the brain level. And so we develop emotional challenges and economic challenges to chronic pain, with chronic pain, obviously in addition to debilitating pain that we perceive, right? So yes, it is a longstanding disease. Much like diabetes, initially, we had thought that it was a disturbance with glucose management, right. Glucose was perturbed. And now we learned that there's a metabolic issue, that it's much more widespread with diabetes, right, and you get retinopathy, nephropathy, your kidneys go, your eyes go, you get obese. And so there are implications that are much broader than the initial insult, which is the challenges in glucose management. Same with chronic pain. You might have initial nerve injury, yet that leads to a much broader issue down the line with chronic pain. And so, to treat chronic pain, we really need to think about it as a multi-pronged approach, a comprehensive approach, to treat pharmacologically various different targets on different levels. It sounds so complicated. Ofer, it sounds like you have to study for 20 years to just be able to understand what you're saying here. But dumb it down for me, because I'm coming in outside of the medical arena. I'm coming in as a young entrepreneur, and I'm trying to think how can we leverage technology in our day to day lives to improve people's habits, people's lives. Now I build applications, or I build algorithms that hopefully will improve people's lives. You're taking people's lives that are suffering and you're actually using medicine to help them. Very different from the work that I do. So, help me understand a little bit better. What is the process that you go about as the chief division of pain medicine? What are your responsibilities? And what is this world of pain medicine? How prevalent is it? How big is it? Is it a really big deal? Let me start with this. So, it doesn't take one individual to treat chronic pain. It takes a team, right? So it takes perhaps a physician to treat medically with different medications. It might take a proceduralist to do injections or use devices that might be implantable and so forth. It might take a physical therapist. It might take a pain psychologist. So we work as a team. Now today, the biggest problem over the decades has been measurement of pain. How do we know how much pain one perceives, right? So do we do a blood test? Do we look at saliva? Do we look at patient reported outcome measures? And so here comes, this is where we have big data come to the rescue, right? And patients can tell us on their phones or devices, "Hey, you know I'm feeling great today. I was able to do this much. I could demonstrate that I was able to walk this many steps today" Right. But what has been the greatest advancement, let's say, over the past 20 years in pain medicine? Has it been really big data and the ability to now understand different similarities and differences amongst patients, or is it more of the medicine itself that has been developing? So I mean, I think that when I was in ... 30 years ago, almost 20, 30 years ago, we were looking at using electrodes to measure pain with animals. Now, we're able to put biosensors on human beings and follow them longitudinally. And so, that is a huge advance. And really, it's something that we can, it's almost a gift to pharmaceutical companies and so forth - Of course because now they're able to have reliable models, if you will, to look at how well they're, it's not necessarily a validated tool for the FDA for approval and so forth. But it is for physicians giving us a tool to follow our patients, not just once a month, but real time. And by the way, - 100% the CMS has caught on to this, and CMS is the body that determines reimbursement pretty much in this country. They decide what Medicare pays and then everybody follows, right, all the payers follow. So, what they've been able to say is that we want people to be monitored longitudinally. So they have chronic disease management codes now. They started just last year, which is giving a huge boost to apps. Right So, an endocrinologist will follow a patient for a certain amount of time every month and be able to look at them not just once a month or periodically or with like a log that someone brings you, but actual data, real time, actually with a sensor. So, these types of things have now come to a field that is actually very complex in terms of- And you know extrapolating this, this isn't just specifically about the doctor following a specific patient, but everybody today I have right here this ring that I usually put on, vut my girlfriend doesn't like when I put it on during the day so I'm taking it off for now. Sorry, Carly. And this ring measures my heart rate constantly, very accurately, measures my sleep. And today, there are so many devices around where an Apple Watch or this ring where I'm asking these devices to measure things for me. Ideally, obviously, I'd like this to be integrated with my primary physician so that they can get an alert automatically like something's wrong with Michael. We better reach out. This is obviously even more important with people that are sick, or I'm thinking about my grandparents that irregularities can unfortunately lead to a tragedy. And sometimes it is time that saves. But Ofer, I'd love to transition also to MedTech, because you have a fascinating joint responsibility of both running the division of pain medicine, but also an investment arm both a part of J-Ventures and outside. So, talk to me about MedTech in general and which areas of this are you excited in? How do you go about your ideas there? Right. So basically, my day job if you will, is to care for patients. And basically, what it has been is develop a program out east in Stamford, Connecticut that's part of the Columbia system, Columbia University system. That you're an assistant professor there right? Right. Right. So, we're basically able to develop a system that will provide outcomes for patients that we're interested in. So, we have an inpatient program for pain management where we cover patients in the hospital and optimize their pain management needs and thereby optimize hospital outcomes. And we also have sort of a population health approach where we take care of out-patients with chronic pain. So that is what I do, and I try to drive the bus a little bit in terms of the philosophy, but also we take care of patients and we love to do it. By the way, why did you choose specifically pain medicine and not any other type of doctor? Why are you excited about working with patients with chronic pain? So that's a good question. I mean, it's obviously a very challenging group of patients. It's neuroscience and I'm a basic scientist and I've come from there. And I was involved in working with one of the teams that we're working on one of the receptors that are integral into chronic pain. And so, sort of fell into the field, but I love working with patients and I enjoy educating. And I was at Stanford in California and in a wonderful environment looking at pain and studying pain and caring for patients that have rare pain conditions. And it's just been something that I really enjoy to do. And some of these patients really have difficult stories, and it's been very rewarding to, at least for some of these patients, increase their activities of daily living, improve their function. That's really what it's all about. How much of this is investigative Sherlock Holmes, like I would need to figure out why you're feeling this way, versus Oh, I've seen your case 100 times. Here is the prescription. Go do these exercises, and let me know how you feel? Which of the two is it more? So I mean I think it depends on the type of pain medicine that you're practicing. I think that 90% of a lot of practices is back pain, neck pain. And a lot of medicine these days has become very prescriptive, right? I think that, my model has been, where I work and with my partners, is that we have more of an academic model and we see patients from regionally and we see some interesting cases. And we like to spend a lot of time working with patients cognitively and making them feel like they're pumped when they leave the office that they're gonna get better and we have a plan. So, it's all about being a good doc at the end of the day. I love that. And so, yeah, that's what we're about. That's amazing. Okay. So now going back to my original question about MedTech. Tell me a little bit about this intersection between you as a doctor, your responsibilities, caring for patients and getting that satisfaction, but also being on the forefront of these technologies and thinking ahead of what's coming up next. Right. So, having trained in Stanford, in California, it's really a wonderful opportunity to really work with some really interesting people and be able to appreciate some problems in our field. And work with engineers and business professionals and kind of be able to answer some of those questions and investigate. So working in that area, in the region, it was, I was able to work with some interesting people, whether it was Doximity, or some other folks in the area. And so, it's been really great to push the envelope and really try to bring questions and needs from the clinic. And be able to meet some folks to be able to accomplish some to answer some of those questions and to develop some technology to answer some of those questions. And now, as an early stage investor, I mean why J-Ventures? Why go and be in the MedTech space? It sounds like you have your hands full being the chief division of pain medicine. Yeah. We certainly don't have much time on our hands, but it's just really wonderful to not only be part of these teams, but also be able to listen to what other people have worked on and really be part of Oded Hermoni's team has just been a wonderful experience to be part of that kibbutz. And and learn as well, obviously, in the process. And meet some wonderful wonderful individuals, have virtual coffee with some wonderful individuals. So, it's just been, I'm very thankful to be able to be a part of that team. Wonderful. And listen, I mean I think that it's always interesting to innovate and to think about what's in the future of our field. And it's really interesting. I had a patient several years ago at a time where if you asked five people, I think several of them might have said, "Telemedicine is never going to work." I think clearly now, we think very differently, right, ... most of us would do. But someone came into the office, and he was like 80 years old at the time probably. And he said, "Listen, when I was a kid, physicians would come to your house. And now, I've got to come to the office." And then it really struck me that, I was in an office. There's magazines, there's a waiting room, and this is just really an artifact of history, most likely. Right? So, now we're able to see the patient. It used to be horse and buggy. Then they used to come to the house. For a while we had the office experience. And I think that in the future, there'll probably be a hybrid. And we're just gonna get better and better at not only seeing patients remotely, but also, as we said, follow them over time without necessarily interacting with them personally. It might be bots, it might be biosensors and so forth. I think it was an insane experience. I mean, that's the right word for it. It was an insane experience that I needed last week when we chatted. I wanted to get a covid test during this crazy pandemic. And I would love to shift the conversation to covid as well. And I got on my phone and I hopped on with my Stanford doctor and she asked to see my ID against the phone to know that it's me. And within ten minutes, I was done with a referral and a full diagnosis of what she thinks with a follow up over SMS. And I was blown away. I said, "Why would I ever want to spend an hour going to the office, waiting in the waiting room, getting sick from somebody else potentially, if I could just do it here." Oh, and by the way, if I can send my Apple Watch messages to her and my ring sleep data to her, then she doesn't, she needs to ask me half the questions because she has everything already. So, I think it's incredible. But Ofer, give me your two cents on what's happening now. It's really a unique time especially, I'm sure, as a doctor. So, what's happening? Where are we headed? What are some interesting things over there? Right. So I think that fortunately, where I am right now, in my hospital, we have zero cases right now after having at a peak 150 patients a day with covid. So luckily, I think that all the efforts have been rewarded, at least for now. I think that you hit the nail on the head. I mean, I think that one of the bigger developments with covid for medicine has been the acceptance, the wide acceptance of Telehealth, and the amount of investment that's gone into it. And really, what's driven this is the decision, that was a prudent decision on the government's part and CMS's part, to basically provide the same amount of reimbursement for Telehealth as they would for in-person visits. And once that incentive was gone to see patients personally, then it was basically, people did what they thought would be easier and more efficient. So, I think this is definitely going to add efficiency, not to mention what you said was about communicable diseases. You don't want to go to the office if you're ill. We do that all the time. Now with covid, very clearly, they tell you if you're feeling sick, you call us and then we determine what the next step would be. But for years, we've been going the doctor for being sick with communicable diseases. So, I think this is a huge change, and hopefully it's here to stay. And that's been really interesting. But Ofer, you're getting satisfaction from seeing the patients that you're helping. They are thanking you. You see that now they're able to walk a little bit better than they did last week and you're getting that satisfaction. Are you gonna get the same satisfaction getting a WhatsApp video of them doing it? Or them thanking you over the phone instead of in person? Because one of the things that I'm now worried about is, is the quality of health care going to go down because doctors are going to be a little less personal, because now I'm just another WhatsApp number. I'm no longer an hour long session where the doctor asks me, "Hey how's your girlfriend, or how's your dog?" Right. No, we have to maintain a certain level of etiquette, obviously. But I think that it's interesting. I've seen patients, certain patients, for years and I've never seen their kitchen, right. And, all of a sudden, I see them in their kitchen. I see them walking their dog on the beach. And I can see how well they're doing, how well they're walking, and how well they may be cleaning their house, and what environment they live in. Whether they live in a total mess of an apartment, or they could actually function. People that have elderly parents and they want to see, they want to be involved in the meeting. We can have our software that we use for telemedicine allows us to pull in the family members. So actually, that now allows us to have a daughter in California and an elderly patient in Connecticut. And that's something that we couldn't do before. But I mean, not to mention the fact that right now, listen, I mean medicine, at least in the laboratories, has been centralized. So there's a centralized model. So if you are going to get a test for BRCA1, for example, which is a gene we look for in breast cancer, all of those tests go to one company, because they do high throughput and they do it most efficiently and cheapest, right? And they have the patent for it. So, in medicine, we still have pain physicians in every town, or we hope that there is. And a neurosurgeon in nearly every town, right. And we're limited to the market that, kind of like a community bank, right. But now we have access to expertise anywhere, right. So you could be living somewhere that may not be a metropolitan area, and you want to see a specialist on some neuroendocrine tumor, and that person might be in New York City or MD Anderson in Texas. And now you're able to access that individual, right. So, that is a huge accomplishment for us on a national scale. To be able to offer, level the playing field for patients. Incredible. I think, yeah. I mean, I'm looking back I grew up with severe severe eye problems. Where growing up, I was basically with a wet towel on my eyes and sunglasses and nobody had any idea what's happening. And we crossed seas in order for me to see experts so that they can take a look at my eye and try to figure out what's happening. And I obviously couldn't get access to have the doctors that I wanted to mainly because of geographical barriers. At the end, it was one doctor in Tel Aviv coming from Russia who said that by the age of 12, it'll pass, and it passed at the age of 12 on my birthday, of course. So whatever experts we went to it was good. But I completely agree. And I think it's inspiring. And I learned so much from this conversation. So, I want to thank you again for your time. Really amazing. But Ofer, before we leave, I have to ask you the most important question: three words that you would use to describe yourself. Well, that's a tough one. - It's the best one. I hate to be put on the spot, but I would like to be humble. I'll use that as one of them. Inquisitive. And I hope to be innovative and helpful. Humble, inquisitive and innovative. I love it. Ofer, toda raba. Thank you very very much. Thank you for the service you're doing. Thank you for helping people, now at Stanford, but now it's going to be around the world because everybody is gonna have access to Ofer through their mobile phone. So, thank you very much. Thanks for doing this. I really appreciate it. Take care.
