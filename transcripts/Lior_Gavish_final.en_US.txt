1 Data in the past used to be, you know, BI reporting that you would look at once a month or once a quarter, whatnot. And, you know, if it's broken, if the numbers are wrong, no worries, you take a few extra days and you go and fix that. Right. And that's changing rapidly today. Like modern tech companies kind of live off of their dashboards. Hundreds, thousands of people look at the data every day to make every single decision. And then increasingly, people are using machine learning models to automate decisions and to do things fully automatically based on data. Lior Gavish, welcome to 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? I'm good. Excited to be here today. I'm honored to have you here. Lior, we have way too many things I want to talk about. I'm just going to dive in to give a little bit about your bio, and then I'll ask some of the fun and interesting questions. You know, Tel Aviv university for bachelors and masters at Stanford. MBA at the GSB. A co-founder of Sookasa, which first of all, it's a beautiful name. And I have to learn more about what you did there, sold to Barracuda after being backed by Accel and Andreessen Horowitz and First Round Capital. Which I have to ask, how the hell you made that happen? Then senior vice president of email protection at Barracuda. And now, the co-founder of another startup, Monte Carlo. Lior, this show is for young entrepreneurs. I'm a young, hungry, scrappy entrepreneur. And I know that there's so much that I can learn from you. So, I really want to make use of these 20 minutes. So, first of all, thank you for being here. And second of all, tell me a little bit about you. Are you an engineer? An Entrepreneur? What are you? It's a great question. And I've been going back and forth about that for a long time now. I'm definitely an engineer by training. And also I think that that's where my heart is at. But I did find myself spending a lot of time on non engineering stuff because I've spent a lot of time in early stage startups. And when you do that, you kind of get to do a lot of different things across the board from, you know, from building teams that to go to market and also product engineering. Right. So, I've definitely spent a lot of time doing other things as well. But I'm still hoping that one day I'll get to get back to writing code all day long. I'm definitely passionate about that. You know, I have to say that that is one of the things that excites me most in talking to people like you on this show. Because you have somebody here who, you know, is an engineer but had such a unique experience both of the GSB, then creating a company that was sold to Barracuda. Being a varied executive manager at Barracuda. Now another again, an entrepreneur. But saying that after all this, you still wish you can go back to writing code because you are truly passionate about technology. And I just love that because I think it's that passion and curious, which leads people like you to these huge milestones. Tell me a little bit about the journey that you took and some of the decisions that you've made along that journey. Because it's not the typical Israeli journey to go to the GSB and then everything else. But tell me a little bit about what you have done there. Yeah. You know, it's been a long journey with a lot of turns. But I started my career as an engineer, right. Like I worked for a couple of startups back in Israel, you know, in my 20s. And at some point there, I felt I wanted a new adventure. It's kind of broadened my horizons and learn things beyond engineering. Maybe try a different place as well. So, that's kind of what inspired me to come to Stanford. And Stanford was kind of a great experience and a great opportunity for me. Because I think it's kind of it brings together like general business training and leadership training and all that good stuff, along with an environment that's very tech oriented and startup oriented. And there's, it's really the community there is very vibrant and very focused around entrepreneurship in tech. So, it was a great kind of combination for me. So, I spent two years there. I dabbled with thinking, I might do non-tech stuff like, I don't know, consulting or semi tech stuff like VC. But ended up deciding that I want to do the thing that I love best, which is startups and engineering. So, I ended up partnering up with my co-founder back then. He was a PhD at Stanford in electrical engineering. We partnered together to start a startup company, Sookasa, in the cybersecurity space. So, that's what I did right after school, right after the GSB. Wait, Lior. You are at Stanford, you're at the GSB. You're thinking about consulting or going to VC or say, no, no, I'm going to be an entrepreneur. And you have a friend, PhD electrical engineering at Stanford. What was the moment where you decided to start this together? Were you always talking about creating a company together? Or did you just say, okay, let's try something? Or did you have an idea first and then join forces? What actually happened there? Yeah. I know, I think I made the decision independently that I want to start a company. It was just too exciting to pass up. And I actually, I worked with a handful of people back then including classmates from GSB. And, you know, you go around between different projects and different ideas and there were in completely different spaces. Like one of us was in e-commerce. And another one was actually also in e-commerce. And then the third one was what I ended up doing with my co-founder back then, whose name is Asaf and just ended up being feeling right. Right? It was the right team. It was the right space. It was an exciting opportunity in a space that seemed to have a lot of dynamics in it, a lot of growth. So, soon it ended up being kind of the right opportunity for me amongst several that I explored. And that's something I would tell anyone thinking of starting a company. You know, it's worthwhile looking through several different teams, if you can, and several different spaces and ideas and see where things stick. Like where do you get your passion and where you see customers getting excited. Where are things moving and changing quickly. And yeah, it worked for me, so. So, you actually ended up spending just about as much time in Barracuda as you did in Sookasa, right? Because you spend about four years in each of them. A little bit less in Barracuda but you had the unique role of being senior vice president of engineering with email protection. And, you know, as a cybersecurity enthusiast myself, I'd love to hear a little bit about what would you do there. And what is it about email protection that it was so relevant to what you were doing? So, when we joined Barracuda, Barracuda acquired Sookasa, and when we joined Barracuda we were fortunate to work with some really, really great leaders there and learn a ton. And one of the things that happened was that we got a carte blanche, like go and do something exciting and can be whatever you want. Right? And I think, after three or four years of doing Sookasa, we felt that we were kind of exhausting, if you will, the market around what we were building at Sookasa. And we're thinking like, what are some adjacent fields, where some areas where we can take this technology and really build something even bigger and even more exciting. And it so happened that those times we're at times of great need in the email protection space. So, it was a time when various types of highly personalized phishing attacks and account takeover attacks and other forms of email fraud were kind of growing really fast. And we realized that the industry was lagging behind in terms of being able to address it. And like every time we spoke to customers, they were inundated with these things and it started to get into kind of material economic damage happening through email text. And so, we had this like very unique approach, technical approach to solving this problem that didn't exist back then and kind of line pretty well with the things that we did at Sookasa. So, we ended up building and launching a product at the Barracuda. The product was, it was the fastest growing product for Barracuda ever. Unbelievable. And kind of ended up leading the market. And we got into the leader wave of Forrester and what not, so, for the first time in the company's history. So, it was really exciting and it was a very gratifying experience. I learned a ton both about the technology and the market that we were operating in, which is email protection. And I also learned a ton about, you know, building teams and companies and learning from senior leaders. That's, I had to admit like throughout my career, before I mostly worked in smaller startups and I do learn a ton. Right? Like you learn a ton by doing. And like figuring stuff out and making your own mistakes. And it was the first time that I was working for people that were far ahead of me in their careers. And I had a great opportunity to learn and really see how they look at things and how they do business and how they lead teams and all that good stuff. So, I stayed for a long time and really, really enjoyed it. Even when I left, I was still very excited about what I was doing. And I would probably be happy to stay there as well. But I ended up leaving for an even more exciting opportunities. What I did today, it's Monte Carlo. I love that. One key difference from being the entrepreneur in the room, you know, as you're scaling your startup and then all of a sudden joining and being senior vice president at a much bigger company, you know, building teams that I'm sure that building a product within a big company is very, very different than building a product within a startup. What is one or two key differences that you've observed from these experiences? Yeah. I know it's a huge difference. I think one difference which has been thoroughly discussed in a lot of books is definitely the kind of some form of the innovator's dilemma, right? Where the company has a certain momentum and has teams that have been spending years and sometimes decades building stuff. And that stuff brings money. Right? And it's selling well and it's working great. And like, how do you come and tell them that, you know, you might do it in a nice way, but how do you come and tell them that that's legacy and that they really need to be investing in this new exciting thing that's making no money right now, but will be big one day. And I think that that's definitely a challenge in a larger organization that where a lot of people have a lot of momentum going in a certain direction. So, that's definitely something that I, you know, you can read about in books, but until you kind of go through it and experience it yourself, it's hard to fully understand. So, that's one thing I learned. The second maybe it was definitely a much larger team in Barracuda. So, I learned that a lot of, that really it's also true for smaller teams, but like culture wins. Right? Every time, right? Yeah. Like my job, I could no longer even fully understand everything that we did. Right? Like, there's so many things going on. I certainly didn't have any opportunity to do things myself. But like the main way by which I could impact the organization was to hire the right people and to put together a, you know, a framework or an environment that would make them successful. So, in the culture. So, that was huge as well, so. Very, very cool. Lior, we don't have much time. But the most exciting opportunity now, Monte Carlo. At first, when I saw that you work in Monte Carlo is, I'm like okay, "Is he building the poker chips that I enjoy playing with my friends on Friday nights?" I'm assuming that it's not that I know that it's all about data. So, tell me a little bit about Monte Carlo and the decision to leave the incredible role of senior vice president in Barracuda to again be a young entrepreneur. Yeah. I know poker chips is definitely one of the ideas we were considering at the time. We decided to go for data. I don't know. Time will tell whether that was the right decision. We'll see. Yeah, I don't know. It's early. But what we do, so, we're definitely in the data space. Our customers, our data teams so, we have data engineers and data analysts and sometimes data scientists. And we help them with a buzzword called observability. So, it's the idea of being able to make systems reliable. And I'll try to explain that. So, you know, maybe the way to think about it is, especially if you've been in engineering is, you know, 20 years ago, if you even had a website and it was broken and went down, nobody cared. Right? Like you might call someone in marketing to take a look at it the next day. Today, any sort of business is strongly reliant on digital and on online applications and websites. And if something gets broken, you know, someone's going to wake up at night to fix it. And in fact, multiple people and it'll be a CEO level issue. Right? And we think the same thing is happening to data. Right? Data in the past used to be, you know, BI reporting that you would look at once a month or once a quarter whatnot. And, you know, if it's broken, if the numbers are wrong, no worries. You take a few extra days and you go and fix that. Right. And that's changing rapidly today. Like modern tech companies kind of live off of their dashboards. Hundreds, thousands of people look at the data every day to make every single decision. And then increasingly, people are using machine learning models to automate decisions and to do things fully automatically based on data. And data is also becoming the product for a lot of companies. Right? They might be serving data to their customers as their service. And so, the reliability of that data, the accuracy of that data, the correctness of that data is becoming important. And it's no longer something that you're you know, you're calling someone and they might take care of it a few days later. It's something that you need to take care of in real time. You need to make sure your data is reliable. And in the same way that there's a lot of methodology in software engineering, a lot of tooling, you know, tools like Datadog and New Relic and AppDynamics to manage, you know, the reliability of applications. We're helping teams with managing the reliability of their data products of reporting, of models, of analytics. So, that's what we're working on today. I love that. Lior, it's such an exciting journey. What are some of the biggest insights that you're taking with you from Sookasa in the early stages now to Monte Carlo? You know, the things that if you hadn't done Sookasa, you probably wouldn't know or you wouldn't believe if others would tell you. Yes. It's a good question. I hope I learned a few things. The main why I think, I think at Sookasa one of, you know, looking back in hindsight is 2020, we were building essentially a security layer for Dropbox. Dropbox back then was taking hold and it was becoming very popular and we felt that businesses will need ways to secure Dropbox and make it more appropriate for confidential or sensitive information. So, that's what we were working on. It was an exciting opportunity. We had kind of early success and we pretty much dominated that market. We were, Dropbox is our number one partner. And if you needed security for Dropbox, Sookasa was your go to solution. And it was all very exciting. However, I think that we were so focused on that specific niche in the market that we overlooked even larger opportunities that existed back then. A category that was later that later became CASB, was happening back in the time. And we could have gone in that category. It was a natural extension of what we were doing. And we didn't. We were super focused, laser focused on optimizing for our niche. And that ended up being a mistake, right? Like the CASB market ended up being much larger and much more interesting over the long term. And I think what I learned from that was, you know, you have to be laser focused on what you're doing. Make your customers happy. And make one customer happy, then make 10 customers happy, etc. And at the same time, you want to be attentive to what's going on and be willing to change course and expand the definition of what you're doing and see where things are going and where the kind of broader market is shifting. And I think that's one of the biggest things I took away. Like at the end of the day, if you want to build a really large company and that's our goal with Monte Carlo, we're here to, you know, to build a unicorn or a decacorn or whatever it is, an industry changing company. And to do that, you really need to see things in a broad way. It's not enough to build like a feature, or like highly satisfy a very narrow need. You try and need to build, in this case, we're trying to build a category. So, that's kind of what I took away to keep your eyes open to category building opportunities that end up being much more exciting. I love that. Lior, thank you so much for the time. I know how busy you are and I appreciate it so much. This is an insightful and it's an honor to have you here. What are three words that you would use to describe yourself? Oh, wow. It's a great question. I'm probably, I've been told, right? I don't know how to describe myself. But I've been told I'm quiet. So, that's one thing. I don't speak much. I've been told I'm fast. I do things very fast. And that's been helpful in my entrepreneurial career. Sometimes it's more important to be fast. And I've also been called stoic. Stoic. So, that's it for you. Yeah. I love that. Lior, thank you so, so much. Really, really great. I appreciate you taking the time to do this. And stay safe and stay healthy. You too, Michael. Great talking to you. Thank you very, very much.
