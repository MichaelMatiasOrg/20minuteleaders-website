1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,600
I say that even to my own kids.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,080
I tell them, you know,

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,640
do whatever interests you, you know,

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,560
whether it's martial arts,

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,200
music or whatever,

6
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,360
but please focus on STEM

7
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,640
because I think this is the future.

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,280
Sleem Hasan,

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,200
thank you so much for joining me

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,040
on 20 Minute Leaders.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,760
How are you?

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,600
Very well, thank you.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,800
Thank you for having me.

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,680
Thank you for inviting me

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,440
to your beautiful home.

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,360
We're here in Dubai.

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,720
Sleem, start by telling me

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,720
about this painting behind us.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,080
Because I think that it has a lot to do

20
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,080
with what's happening

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,360
in this room right now in our dialogue.

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,560
Well, let's pick up

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,000
from the last word you've just uttered.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,680
Because that actually

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,600
the name of the painting.

26
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,360
The painting is called, The Dialogue.

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,800
And it was commissioned by a gentleman

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,440
who used to live in Dubai 15 years ago

29
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,440
by an artist who I had the good fortune

30
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,640
of meeting 20 years ago in London

31
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,640
way before I moved to Dubai.

32
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,920
And the commissioner asked,

33
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,520
Ralph Heimans, who is the artist,

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,280
to paint something

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,400
that focuses on the region

36
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,960
but focuses on interfaith.

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,480
And this is what Ralph produced,

38
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,040
what is behind us.

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,320
So, why is it hanging on my wall

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,320
if it was commissioned by somebody else?

41
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,720
So, after six months

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,120
or thereabouts in 2005,

43
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,200
when Ralph completed the painting

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,320
and he came to visit Dubai

45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,960
for the first time,

46
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,640
we went to hand over the painting to

47
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,680
the clients who commissioned Ralph,

48
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,840
only to find out

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,200
when we unveiled the painting

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,720
that he disapproved of the image.

51
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,240
Having approved,

52
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,200
paid everything prior to.

53
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,960
So, he did a total bull of us.

54
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,720
And of course, Ralph was,

55
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,960
you know, crestfallen.

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,280
I certainly was gobsmacked

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,520
because in my world,

58
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,560
when you shake hands with somebody

59
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,200
and do a deal

60
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,240
and you don't renege on it.

61
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,240
But this was a very influential person

62
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,400
in Dubai at the time.

63
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,240
We gave him,

64
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,920
I was one year old in Dubai.

65
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,080
We gave him his money back

66
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,560
and we walked out

67
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,320
with our tails between our legs.

68
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,240
And then at that moment,

69
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,680
I turned around to Ralph Heimans,

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,200
who is the,

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,200
you know, the person who

72
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,120
painted this painting

73
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,085
called, The Dialogue, and said,

74
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:54,480
"Ralph, you know what?

75
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,160
I am not legally or contractually

76
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,480
I said to myself, obliged

77
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,440
but you know what?

78
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,440
I just felt bad."

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,480
I said, "I'll buy it

80
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,880
so you won't have wasted your time."

81
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:05,600
Ralph never forgot that gesture.

82
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,600
Today, by the grace of God,

83
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,000
I am one of the three people

84
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,320
in Ralph's world

85
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,040
who can actually represent him globally

86
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,360
on his website, ralphheimans.com

87
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,040
to handle his commission inquiries.

88
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,440
He later went on

89
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,800
to get his first royal commission in '06.

90
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,200
And then fast forward to 2012,

91
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,280
his first serious royal commission.

92
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,880
He was the only artist commissioned

93
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,760
by Buckingham Palace

94
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,400
to paint the queen

95
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,280
for the diamond jubilee.

96
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,520
That painting for any of those

97
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,160
who live in London,

98
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,080
who visit London,

99
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,720
I invite them to go to Westminster Abbey

100
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,200
because that's the final resting place

101
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,160
of her majesty, the queen's painting.

102
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,560
She's the totum factotum royal

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,320
in the planet, as you know.

104
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,200
And, that painting hangs

105
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,280
at Westminster Abbey today.

106
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,840
Fast forward 2018, '19.

107
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,960
I was here in Dubai.

108
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,720
And I was in Karachi

109
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,240
and then I came back

110
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,640
in the new year in '19.

111
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,360
And all the papers were talking about

112
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,800
the big event that's going to take place

113
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,600
for the first time in this country.

114
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,480
So, what was the big event?

115
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,080
The big event was that

116
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,640
Pope Francis is going to visit the UAE

117
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,400
for the first time.

118
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,320
So, we are all very excited.

119
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,520
You know,

120
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
the Holy See from the Vatican

121
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,400
is coming to Abu Dhabi.

122
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,320
He conducted a mass.

123
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,120
He came for three days

124
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,760
during something called

125
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,240
Interfaith Harmony Week,

126
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,440
February 3rd to 5th.

127
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,560
He was only here for 48 hours.

128
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,960
The whole world covered that event.

129
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,000
CNN, Reuters, Bloomberg,

130
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
all the usual suspects.

131
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,640
And he conducted a mass for nearly

132
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,760
100,000 Catholic Christians.

133
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,560
This was amazing.

134
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
And the interesting,

135
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,680
what is even more amazing

136
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,200
was that every paper

137
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,280
talked about two words

138
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,800
that the pope was focusing on.

139
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,480
Now watch my hands.

140
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,960
What were the two words?

141
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,440
Interfaith

142
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,800
Dialogue.

143
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,240
And I've got tons of newspaper articles

144
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,320
if you want that you can read.

145
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,400
When I saw these two words, I went crazy.

146
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,040
I said, 15 years ago,

147
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,360
14 years ago back then,

148
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,960
painting was done in Dubai by this artist

149
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,120
called, The Dialogue,

150
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,240
subject matter was interfaith.

151
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,120
Now, look how those words

152
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,440
have now moved coming out of the mouth

153
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,800
of the Holy See.

154
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,640
Right.

155
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,263
People came,

156
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,560
they want to know about this,

157
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,480
that about the painting.

158
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,600
I didn't do anything.

159
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,640
I just carried on.

160
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,520
I love that.

161
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Fast forward this year,

162
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,920
you know, minding my own business,

163
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,360
suddenly August the 13th,

164
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,320
we are all reading these two words,

165
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,160
Abraham Accords.

166
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,560
When I read carefully,

167
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,680
I had no words.

168
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,440
And actually, for the first time,

169
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,880
I turn around

170
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,080
and I said, "You know what?

171
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,600
I'm prepared to even give this painting."

172
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,160
But to whom?

173
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,000
And for what reason?

174
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,320
Well, the message of this painting

175
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,000
is not a message that I manufactured.

176
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,040
It was a message that I stood by

177
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,480
15 years ago at a time

178
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,000
when there was no Abraham Accords.

179
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,120
Right.

180
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,900
Correct?

181
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:23,440
Yes.

182
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,040
Okay, did I plan the Abraham Accord?

183
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
No.

184
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,320
I'm living here.

185
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,080
Minding my own business

186
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,960
like any resident in this place,

187
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,200
doing my best.

188
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,520
And when I see the Abraham Accord,

189
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,560
I then reached out

190
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,120
to one of the ministers here

191
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,200
who had actually invited Ralph

192
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,160
in an official capacity in December 2019

193
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,720
for some work

194
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,520
and said, "You know what?

195
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,320
I believe this painting

196
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,960
deserves a gift from

197
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,640
a leader here to Netanyahu, for example."

198
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
They said at the time,

199
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,680
look, the deal has not been signed.

200
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,640
It's just an announcement.

201
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,520
Maybe it's a bit premature.

202
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,200
I said I'm a nobody.

203
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,120
It's okay.

204
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,680
I respect it.

205
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,360
Quietly, I kept my head down.

206
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,760
No problem.

207
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,080
Early September,

208
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,240
His Highness Abdullah bin Zayed

209
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
went to the White House

210
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,560
in front of the whole world,

211
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,560
signed Abraham Accord.

212
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,200
Again, before he was going,

213
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,320
I reached out to another minister.

214
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,520
I said,

215
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,640
I think he should give it to Trump now.

216
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,520
Again, there was no response.

217
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,640
And then I decided, you know what?

218
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
I'll rescind in my offer.

219
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,680
I tried.

220
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,080
I cannot force something

221
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,800
whose time has not come

222
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,240
and I cannot manufacture something

223
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
that does not exist.

224
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,560
But I know there was a message

225
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,360
that I stood by 15 years ago

226
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,680
and with God's grace,

227
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,440
when did the whole world

228
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,200
will hear about it.

229
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,280
Today,

230
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,040
if somebody came to me and says,

231
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,600
"Sleem, you want to sell the painting?"

232
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,600
"Go to Sotheby's,

233
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,800
go to Christie's, go to this."

234
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,160
I said, 'No,

235
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,040
we don't need Sotheby's or Christie's."

236
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,800
I will ask you one question.

237
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,920
If you can answer it,

238
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,840
I'll put a price on the painting.

239
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,640
So, what is the question?

240
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,760
If you can put a price

241
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,360
on peace between Israel

242
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,760
and its Arab neighbors,

243
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,225
i will put a price on this painting.

244
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:29,200
If you can.

245
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,680
I'm welcome

246
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,120
I'm listening.

247
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,440
If you can do it, welcome.

248
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,640
So, that's a lot of the story behind it.

249
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,320
In fact, this whole journey,

250
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,880
what I'm sharing with you now

251
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,280
was actually aired for the first time

252
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,280
about six weeks ago

253
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,600
through a podcast

254
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,960
that took place out of New York.

255
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,040
Alex Romanovich runs

256
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,560
a platform called GlobalEdgeTalk.

257
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,600
So, a lot of this and the material

258
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,520
has already been shared.

259
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,080
But it's in the light of,

260
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,360
you know, the aftermath

261
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,680
of the Abraham Accord,

262
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,320
and now, you know,

263
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,320
the normalization of relationships

264
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,760
between both sovereign states,

265
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,160
you know,

266
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,040
the story is now being told

267
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,400
for the first time.

268
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,640
Not even when Ralph,

269
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,760
with all due respect,

270
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,520
got the the commission

271
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
from Buckingham Palace.

272
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,360
I did not say anything.

273
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,800
You know, it is beautiful for Ralph.

274
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,960
You know, he's a,

275
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,600
today is referred

276
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,480
to as a modern day Caravaggio.

277
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,160
Anybody who doesn't know him,

278
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,120
please go and check him out.

279
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,400
If you want Caravaggio today,

280
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,640
and not Caravaggio prices, go to Ralph.

281
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,600
You know, I mean, you know,

282
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,680
but that's not the point.

283
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,680
The point is this has been

284
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,640
a long journey for me.

285
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,680
It's a very important journey in my life.

286
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,040
And it's got nothing even to do

287
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,760
with my main business

288
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,640
that I came to do in Dubai,

289
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,160
you know, 16 years ago.

290
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,400
It was the start of this business

291
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,880
in looking for technology entrepreneurs.

292
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,360
But today,

293
00:10:02,361 --> 00:10:04,160
if somebody asks me, "Sleem,

294
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,280
what are your three passions in life?"

295
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,160
Okay, they're very simple now.

296
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,960
It's technology, art,

297
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,840
as you can see around the house.

298
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,800
We, both my wife and I are keen on that.

299
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,840
And interfaith dialogue.

300
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,680
Right.

301
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,280
Interfaith dialogue to me,

302
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,040
is very, very important.

303
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,520
I explain my background to you earlier.

304
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,800
There were Six Flags I showed you.

305
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,280
Right.

306
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,520
Right?

307
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,160
You know, the Fiji Islands, Pakistan,

308
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,920
Nigeria, UK, Japan

309
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,160
and now the United Arab Emirates.

310
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,800
You know, I can move between

311
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,320
these geographies quite seamlessly.

312
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:41,120
I lived in Africa.

313
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,280
I grew up in Africa.

314
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,600
I hail from Pakistan.

315
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,840
I worked 37 years with the Japanese.

316
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,280
It's a different culture.

317
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,840
I'm now living in the UAE for 16 years.

318
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,000
So it's a melange, you know,

319
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,080
a mixture of different people,

320
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,160
different types.

321
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,520
And that's why I look at life today.

322
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,120
You know, your five fingers on your hand,

323
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,320
they all belong to you,

324
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,200
they're all different sizes,

325
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,880
they coexist.

326
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
You've got to put all those five

327
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,120
fingers and they wanted to be equal,

328
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,680
they'd be equal.

329
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,480
They're not, but they coexist.

330
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,320
So, learn from your hand.

331
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,640
Lessons of life.

332
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,960
Sleem, you have a fascinating upbringing

333
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,440
all the way from Nigeria, all the way

334
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,000
to go into the business in Japan.

335
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,320
Now, in the UAE,

336
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,280
with three more flags in between.

337
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,840
Your background is in mathematics.

338
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,000
So, you study mathematics.

339
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,720
Yes, I did.

340
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,960
In Oxford and Cambridge.

341
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,440
And you transitioned from academia

342
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,560
to becoming a problem solver.

343
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,640
Tell me a little bit about your mindset,

344
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,240
like you did earlier,

345
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,040
about what it means

346
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
to be a problem solver,

347
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,320
whether it's in mathematics

348
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,960
or in life or in interfaith dialogue?

349
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,960
Well, look, in life, a mathematician

350
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,680
is trained to solve problems

351
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,280
at the basic,

352
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,360
at the essence, at the core.

353
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,360
So, any mathematician

354
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
worth his or her salt

355
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,640
will learn, keep trying

356
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,000
and have the ability to solve problems.

357
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,080
Those problems, obviously,

358
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,680
are mathematical in nature.

359
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,120
However, when you go out

360
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,280
into the big world,

361
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,520
there are other types of problems

362
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,000
that come about.

363
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:12,880
But the problem

364
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,120
and a problem solving

365
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,960
capacity or ability,

366
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,640
I see parallels between them.

367
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,080
It's the way your mind

368
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,800
is hardwired, the DNA.

369
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,280
I say that even to my own kids.

370
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,760
I tell them, you know,

371
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,280
do whatever interests you, you know,

372
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,200
whether it's martial arts,

373
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,840
music or whatever.

374
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,000
But please focus on STEM,

375
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,840
because I think this is the future,

376
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,640
you know.

377
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,800
And when I was 17,

378
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,560
I told my late parents at the time,

379
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,840
"You know, Dad, Mom,

380
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,440
I want to study Math in a University."

381
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:43,880
And I remember

382
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,840
my mother's words at the time.

383
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,240
She said, "No.

384
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,320
You're going to become a teacher.

385
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,240
What are you going to do?

386
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,360
Become an engineer and get a profession."

387
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,840
Of course, a different generation,

388
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,480
a different mindset.

389
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,480
I respect that.

390
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,880
However,

391
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,520
my dad said one beautiful thing.

392
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,120
He said, "Let him follow his heart."

393
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,600
Today, I am so grateful

394
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,040
that he allowed me to follow my heart

395
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,800
when I was 17.

396
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,080
And today it's that mathematics

397
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,320
that is really, really the core,

398
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,400
the essence

399
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,480
of how I look at everything in life.

400
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,240
I analyze,

401
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,640
I'm constantly running simulations

402
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,000
of things, you know.

403
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,200
When I meet entrepreneurs today,

404
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
I'm analyzing them literally

405
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
from the minute they open their mouth

406
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,960
and interact with me.

407
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,040
You know, and it's going on.

408
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,840
It's like a, you know,

409
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,440
the CPU of a computer,

410
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,600
it's just running at the back, you know,

411
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,360
crunching, and this is what I do.

412
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,880
So, I'm analyzing.

413
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,560
You know, they show me

414
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,800
a five year projections in numbers

415
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,920
and this and that.

416
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,360
You know, you can

417
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,520
analyze it very quickly.

418
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,000
And it's not conceptually difficult.

419
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,200
Right.

420
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,240
What we do now, what I'm doing right now

421
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,360
in the VC world,

422
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,680
it's not conceptually difficult.

423
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,960
It's more commercial.

424
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,480
It's more speed, access, people,

425
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,080
networks, you know.

426
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,080
But is it conceptually difficult?

427
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,440
No.

428
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,000
The part three

429
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,040
of the Math Tripos I did at Cambridge,

430
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,680
that was conceptually difficult.

431
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,760
This is not.

432
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,640
When we were sitting back in your office,

433
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,560
you were mentioning to me

434
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,880
we didn't even talk about the numbers

435
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,800
and the five year projections,

436
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,600
you we're talking about

437
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,560
sniffing the right entrepreneur.

438
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,800
Smelling the right opportunity

439
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,240
to partner with the right person,

440
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,360
not just their ideas

441
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,240
and not just the capital,

442
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,680
but the entrepreneur.

443
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:23,960
Yes.

444
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,440
Tell me about that as your role

445
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,400
as a one man VC CEO,

446
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,600
because that is what you are.

447
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,909
We talked a little bit

448
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,040
about your mindset before.

449
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,880
And one of the most remarkable things

450
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,520
I think about your journey

451
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,480
that I'm so inspired by

452
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,720
is your outlook

453
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,120
on the globality of things

454
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,000
and how tech integrates

455
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,920
all parts of the world,

456
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,080
not just Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv.

457
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,480
And you are one of the people

458
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
on the forefront of that.

459
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,080
Tell me a little bit about your mindset.

460
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,640
Well, thank you for asking that question.

461
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,720
And I really appreciate it.

462
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,960
And again, I like to break things down,

463
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,040
you know, in bite sizes

464
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,560
so people can understand it very easily.

465
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,200
And my answer to that is very simple.

466
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,800
When you go to a bar,

467
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,480
you meet people, you meet friends,

468
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,280
some you connect with,

469
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,400
some you don't. Correct?

470
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,440
What is that first exchange,

471
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,520
that chemistry that is taking place

472
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,800
that connects with one person

473
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,520
as opposed to somebody else

474
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,240
before they even open their mouth?

475
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,720
There's a human attraction,

476
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,240
there's a human proclivity,

477
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,200
there's a human affinity,

478
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,040
whatever you want to call it.

479
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,480
And then,

480
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,720
the guy opens the mouth, talks,

481
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,400
exchange, ideas are being exchanged.

482
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,280
Some are receptive to, some are not.

483
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,040
So, let's not take that basic thing out

484
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,360
from the example I cited

485
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,800
into the entrepreneur world.

486
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,640
Say you meet an entrepreneur

487
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,440
for the first time.

488
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,640
Some people you will connect with,

489
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,520
some people you will not.

490
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,320
The ones you don't connect with

491
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,640
doesn't mean they don't have a good idea.

492
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,400
The chances are as a VC this size,

493
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,480
you know, and you have 24 hours in a day,

494
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,080
it becomes part

495
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,440
of your filtering mechanism.

496
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,000
The ones you connect with

497
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,280
and then you like the idea,

498
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,800
that's a good starting off point.

499
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,360
So, I say,

500
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,880
I only am agnostic to geography

501
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,040
as I am to industry vertical.

502
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,120
I only care about the underlying

503
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,000
compelling value proposition of the idea.

504
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,120
Open your mouth

505
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,800
and appeal to my intellect.

506
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,080
Once you appeal to it,

507
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,720
I will get engaged.

508
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,360
Once I get engaged,

509
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,200
doesn't mean I'm right.

510
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,440
I have a three companies

511
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,600
that's right in my portfolio.

512
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,120
I've got three exits.

513
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,040
I've got one company that's got

514
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,320
the backing and funding with tier-one

515
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,080
Silicon Valley couple VCs sitting here

516
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,560
in that little office you came into

517
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,920
in Dubai?.

518
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,360
So, this is my journey.

519
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,200
This is what I do.

520
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,360
I connect with people,

521
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,880
I connect with cultures,

522
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,440
I connect with all religions,

523
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,200
I connect with society

524
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,760
and I'm not saying it.

525
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,080
I've done it.

526
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,720
I've connected with all kinds of people.

527
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,960
Even way before the Abraham Accord

528
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,800
that is now official,

529
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,040
i had many Jewish friends.

530
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,800
Some from Israel, some, you know,

531
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,120
Persian Jews or, you know,

532
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,080
Jews from wherever.

533
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,360
You know, I have a lot of friends.

534
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,520
But it was never something that

535
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,080
I grew up seeing,

536
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,040
oh, that guy's a Buddhist,

537
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,880
that guy's an Indian,

538
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,000
that guy's a Jew.

539
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,240
No, it's not the way I was brought up.

540
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,320
I was brought up by my parents.

541
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,680
That's my late father picture

542
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,640
I'm pointing to over there

543
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,760
and my late mother is over there.

544
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,320
They are beautiful.

545
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,560
Yeah.

546
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,480
I was brought up to respect people.

547
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,080
You know, my dad used to always tell me,

548
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,400
"Son, you take any two people in the world

549
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,120
and ask them

550
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,080
how many hours in your day."

551
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,920
Answer, 24.

552
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,680
How many in yours? 24.

553
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,240
On what basis

554
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,400
is this time more valuable than yours?

555
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,000
It's a mathematical constant.

556
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,240
First differential is zero.

557
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
How can your time

558
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,040
be more valuable than his.

559
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,680
And you take any five people in a room,

560
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,560
all different nationalities. One Spanish,

561
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,200
one Indian, one Israeli, one Jewish,

562
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,960
one Japan, whatever.

563
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,560
And you make a small cut in their skin.

564
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,960
If the color that comes out

565
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,640
from any one of those

566
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,760
people is different, come back to me.

567
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,480
This is how I was brought up.

568
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,600
This is the fundamental tenets

569
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,400
I use to lead my life.

570
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
I'm not impressed about money.

571
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,880
I'm not impressed about,

572
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,640
people who sit on billions

573
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,760
of dollars of funds.

574
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,600
First, it's not theirs.

575
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,760
And if it was theirs, okay, great.

576
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,800
With hard work,

577
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,320
I have no objections to that.

578
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,760
But to tell me you manage a fund

579
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,800
of somebody else's money

580
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,960
and it does not impress you

581
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,200
because that but a great idea,

582
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,440
I bow my head to that.

583
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:49,960
Again,

584
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:52,080
another quote from my late father.

585
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,200
He said, "Son,

586
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,840
you bow your head to two things in life.

587
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,640
First and foremost, your creator.

588
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,720
Second, in that order,

589
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,560
superior intellect."

590
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,080
I've taken his words

591
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,320
and I made a business out of it.

592
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,760
Today, the people I bow my head to

593
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,720
are the entrepreneurs.

594
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,920
They're the smart ones, not me.

595
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,280
So, respect the entrepreneur.

596
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,680
And today, with interest rates

597
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,040
being next to zero or negative,

598
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,840
even the market doesn't

599
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,320
value money anymore.

600
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
So, who am I to stand in the way of that?

601
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,920
What does the fund mean?

602
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,800
I don't know.

603
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,640
You're talking about bowing your head

604
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,560
to the entrepreneurs

605
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,480
and not necessarily the capital

606
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,760
or whatever the status is.

607
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,840
But you are an entrepreneur yourself.

608
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,520
You sold your company.

609
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,400
Yes.

610
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,720
And then you put your own capital

611
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,240
with no outside investment to Privity also,

612
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,560
the VC fund that you own yourself.

613
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,440
It's your own money in it.

614
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,080
Why go that route?

615
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,800
Why go the route

616
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,840
where you are investing in yourself?

617
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,760
Because it seems to be

618
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,600
a big part of who you are, right?

619
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,800
Well, perhaps it is.

620
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,640
You know, I mean,

621
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,400
in life, I tried working

622
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,160
in a corporate world.

623
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,040
I did well in a corporate world.

624
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,960
But there was too much fire in the belly.

625
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,440
And, you know, I was

626
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,320
running when everybody was walking.

627
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,960
And I was walking

628
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,160
when everybody was sitting,

629
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,320
you know, so, it's who I am.

630
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,200
And I am not here

631
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,600
to impose my views on anybody.

632
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,200
I see people want to build

633
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,600
multi-billion dollar empires.

634
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,840
Great, do it.

635
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,040
But I have my own journeys in life

636
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,760
and I also go to my own beliefs.

637
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,960
And part of that quote of my own beliefs

638
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,440
is the,

639
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,160
I was also influenced by a book

640
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,240
I read by Todd Henry, Die Empty.

641
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,760
I believe that's where

642
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,440
we all will end up.

643
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,520
You know the book?

644
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,640
I don't.

645
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,560
This is important, I think,

646
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,840
for your fellow students

647
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,120
and whoever you are sharing this with.

648
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,120
Somebody was asked one day,

649
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,400
where do you find the most

650
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,800
expensive real estate in the world?

651
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,120
This is the theme of the book,

652
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,280
which is really influenced me.

653
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,480
And it said, somebody said, you know,

654
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,480
Tokyo, the Imperial Gardens,

655
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,200
somebody said Rockefeller Center.

656
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,600
Somebody said, you know,

657
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,680
Buckingham Palace, wherever.

658
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,520
He said, "No, you are all wrong.

659
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,240
That is not the

660
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
most expensive real estate

661
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,400
in the world."

662
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:18,720
And you've got

663
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,680
all these big funds buying real estate.

664
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,640
You know, now guess

665
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,480
what covid has done to it.

666
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,720
We don't know.

667
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,360
It's not me.

668
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,720
I didn't do covid, you know,

669
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,240
something happened.

670
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,080
But he said in this book, he said,

671
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,240
"The graveyard

672
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
is the most expensive real estate

673
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,400
in the world."

674
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,920
And the guy asked him,

675
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,640
"Why is the graveyard

676
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,760
the most expensive real estate

677
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,160
in the world?"

678
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,960
He said,

679
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,080
"You know, the number of people

680
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,760
with amazing ideas

681
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,440
who did not share it with the world,

682
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,880
who end up six feet under?

683
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,320
What a waste to humanity."

684
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,960
When I started absorbing that,

685
00:21:59,961 --> 00:22:01,800
I said, "What's the point

686
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
of chasing money?"

687
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,080
Yes, you need something to live,

688
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,480
eat, a roof over your head.

689
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,280
There's enough in this world

690
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,920
for everyone's need,

691
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,360
but certainly not enough in this

692
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,760
world for everyone's greed.

693
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,480
So, it was a rewiring of the brain.

694
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,840
So, I'm happy to do it on my journey.

695
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,920
If somebody wants to join, welcome.

696
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,240
I have a very simple philosophy in life.

697
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,760
Never say no to the first cup of coffee.

698
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,840
I learned that when

699
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,240
through Ralph actually, the artist

700
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,480
20 years ago.

701
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,335
Because was my mind

702
00:22:28,336 --> 00:22:29,640
was focused in Japan trading

703
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,480
and anything that was out of that world

704
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,680
I didn't want to, no,

705
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,760
keep an open mind, meet people,

706
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,440
try different experiences,

707
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,080
different cultures, eat different food.

708
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,160
You know, spend time travelling

709
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,080
when once covid allows,

710
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,280
you know, things normalize a bit.

711
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,440
And this gives you a much better rounded,

712
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,280
balanced view of life.

713
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,000
But this is the way I've been brought up.

714
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,600
I loved it.

715
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,120
Sleem, this was inspiring.

716
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,480
Thank you for sharing with me

717
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,400
your journey, your passion,

718
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,960
both for technology, for ideas,

719
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,560
but also for interfaith and dialogue.

720
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,960
I really didn't expect this coming in.

721
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,400
And I think it's a remarkable,

722
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,840
inspiring for me

723
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,160
as I'm ending here on my trip

724
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,360
in Dubai this past week

725
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,760
to have this as the final conversation.

726
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,200
It leaves me with inspiration,

727
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,040
hope and mainly excitement

728
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,960
to come back.

729
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,800
Welcome, any time.

730
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,160
And work on really

731
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,240
impactful things together.

732
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,480
So thank you very, very much.

733
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,120
Shalom.

734
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,600
Shalom.

735
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,880
The very last thing that I have to ask,

736
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,720
which is the most important question,

737
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,280
three words that you would use

738
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,200
to describe yourself.

739
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,880
I have a feeling

740
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,480
I know some of them already

741
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,040
and I have a feeling

742
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,920
you mentioned them already,

743
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,280
but three words that anybody

744
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,960
who knows Sleem Hasan

745
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:41,640
would say about you.

746
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,160
Well, I think first and foremost,

747
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,320
it would be passionate.

748
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,280
Yeah.

749
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,400
You know, persistent and perseverance.

750
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,360
Those are the three piece

751
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,960
that guide me in my life.

752
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,320
I never give up to anything.

753
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,240
If I fundamentally have

754
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,360
a core belief in something,

755
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,120
nobody can change my mind

756
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,640
other than an act of God who was my

757
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,360
the ultimate, my creator and who's

758
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,520
leased my life to me.

759
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,760
Our lives have been leased to us.

760
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,440
We don't even own that.

761
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,200
So, we don't own that.

762
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,720
How can we put claims

763
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,920
and other things when our own,

764
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,600
the most precious things

765
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,080
we don't even own.

766
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,520
You know,

767
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,040
it's a fundamental philosophical way

768
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,680
of looking at life.

769
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,640
And because of that,

770
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,080
then you suddenly realize,

771
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,520
you're just a,

772
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,360
you know, a tiny little speck,

773
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,040
you know.

774
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,640
And it puts things into perspective,

775
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,520
you know.

776
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,240
And to me,

777
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,240
i never like to talk about it,

778
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,800
but, you know,

779
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,440
there's a wonderful poem that

780
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,320
when I was 15,

781
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,360
I learned by the guy

782
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,640
who wrote Pilgrim's Progress

783
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,520
called John Bunyan.

784
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,720
It's called Contentment.

785
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,480
Again, this poem influenced

786
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,720
me in my life when I was 15.

787
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,760
And I recommend anyone to Google

788
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,360
and just check it out

789
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,520
if they're not already read it.

790
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,120
And I'll just read the first

791
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,040
stanza for you, you know.

792
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,360
He that is down needs fear no fall,

793
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,120
He that is low, no pride;

794
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,997
He that is humble, ever shall

795
00:25:13,998 --> 00:25:15,680
Have God to be his guide.

796
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,200
That first stanza, you know,

797
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,800
has influenced me in my life.

798
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Nothing wrong with being down and low,

799
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,480
you will never fall.

800
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,200
You will never fall in life.

801
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,760
You can only fall when you rise

802
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,600
and you will fall when you rise because

803
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,280
you know certain things overtake

804
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,360
those basic tenets

805
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,240
that you lose track of

806
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,600
as you are rising.

807
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,320
If you don't lose it,

808
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,640
you will continue to rise.

809
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,640
I love it.

810
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,360
Sleem, thank you very much.

811
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:46,960
You're welcome.

812
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,720
This is wonderful.
