1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,679
I would sit down with the engineers,

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,559
the developers of the software and say,

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,279
explain this to me,

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,879
so that I completely understood it

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,239
and only then could I write about it.

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,159
Because, I mean,

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,719
if you've ever tried to explain something

8
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,079
you don't understand,

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,479
it doesn't work, right?

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,159
But if you understand it, you can take

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,520
what is complex and make it simple.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,759
Minette Norman,

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,119
welcome to 20 Minute Leaders.

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,879
Thank you for joining me.

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,360
How are you?

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:56,880
I'm good.

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,760
Thanks for having me

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,040
and for inviting me

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,720
Of course.

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,240
Thank you.

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,640
Where are you calling from right now?

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm in the San Francisco Bay Area.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I live in Marin County,

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,880
just north of San Francisco.

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,560
Wonderful.

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,240
It's a beautiful, beautiful area.

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,560
I really enjoyed

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,000
going hiking there before covid

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,040
and hopefully after covid as well.

30
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,720
More than 30 years of experience

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,200
in the tech and software industry,

32
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,080
but it all starts with nothing else

33
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,600
but a major in drama and French.

34
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,440
How does that happen?

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,880
Exactly.

36
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,840
How does that happen?

37
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,680
I'm not quite sure.

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,640
But I'll tell you

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,840
the brief story of how it all went down.

40
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,560
So, I got out of university

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,160
with a degree in drama and French

42
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,560
and realized that being an actor,

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,760
which I aspired to be,

44
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,720
is a really hard work.

45
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,280
And I hated going to auditions.

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,960
And I realized that wasn't for me.

47
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:46,239
So, I had to get a job.

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,880
My first job out a school

49
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,120
was being a French teacher.

50
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,320
But soon after that,

51
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:51,119
I got a job at the

52
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,119
French Trade Commission

53
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,999
in New York City where I was living,

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,439
when they introduced computers

55
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,919
for the first time.

56
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,479
And it turned out,

57
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,999
this is going way, way back,

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,080
this dates me more than twice your age,

59
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,159
I think Michael,

60
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,200
but this was like the original PCs,

61
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,800
the IBM PC is back in the 80s,

62
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,240
and it turned out I was a quick study.

63
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:12,399
And I learned how to use them.

64
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,000
I figured out

65
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,240
how to use them pretty well.

66
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,320
But what I was really good at

67
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,000
was explaining how to use them

68
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,080
to the people who didn't understand

69
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
and who were kind of scared

70
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,120
and intimidated by them.

71
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:23,599
And so, that led me,

72
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,159
that was sort of the crucial step

73
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,159
in my career that led me

74
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,400
to the tech industry.

75
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:30,239
I decided to leave New York

76
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
back in the late 80s

77
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,160
and moved to California,

78
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,600
where I'd grown up, in the Bay Area.

79
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,520
And I decided,

80
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,160
based on advice from a friend,

81
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,800
that I was going to try to become

82
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,720
a technical writer,

83
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,400
because what technical writers do

84
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,040
is actually translate

85
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,400
technical information into something

86
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,920
digestible and understandable

87
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:49,079
by a layperson.

88
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,759
And so, this is like 1989 timeframe.

89
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,999
And I was applying to the very few

90
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,400
software companies that were around,

91
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,640
and one of them happened to be Adobe.

92
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,080
And so, back in 1989,

93
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,240
I'm having this interview at Adobe

94
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,920
and they're asking me questions like,

95
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,360
"What do you know about

96
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,680
print reproduction and photography?"

97
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,320
And the answer to all of those

98
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,040
questions was, "I know nothing".

99
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,799
But they hired me

100
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,200
to be a technical writer

101
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,680
and my first assignment was to write

102
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,440
the tutorial for Photoshop version 1.0.

103
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,480
No. Really?

104
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,360
Yes. Seriously.

105
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,320
Yes. Yes.

106
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,840
And if you give me a minute,

107
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,240
I'll probably, I have a copy here,

108
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,160
I'm sure. I'll pull it out of my drawer.

109
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,040
Wow, that is so cool.

110
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,520
Can you see that?

111
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah.

112
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,600
Wow.

113
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,920
That was 1989.

114
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,440
It actually came out in 1990.

115
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,360
So, that was my first job in tech.

116
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,880
You wrote a book basically.

117
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,720
That was your first published book.

118
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,200
Exactly.

119
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:48,679
That is just incredible.

120
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,639
And I wrote several after

121
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,959
for Photoshop and Illustrator

122
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,680
and Premier

123
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,280
and all sorts of Adobe products.

124
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,200
And then,

125
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,240
what happened after that is

126
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,040
because I was young

127
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,400
and it was early days

128
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,520
and there were so much going on

129
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,680
in Silicon Valley, so I moved around

130
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,840
from company to company.

131
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,600
So, I went from Adobe to Symantec.

132
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
Actually, that's not the order.

133
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,480
I went from Adobe to EFI to a startup,

134
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,360
Symantec and then finally Autodesk.

135
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,480
So, I basically, in 10 years

136
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,040
from '89 to '99,

137
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,080
I was a technical writer

138
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,160
at five different companies

139
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,440
in the Valley, and then in '99,

140
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,720
I landed at Autodesk.

141
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,560
And I ended up staying at Autodesk

142
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,600
for 20 years.

143
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,320
And I went on this crazy journey, right.

144
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,000
So, talk to me about this crazy journey

145
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,480
because you end up

146
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,760
as vice president at Autodesk,

147
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,120
which is incredible itself.

148
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,000
But it's always the journey

149
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that's even more impressive.

150
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,440
So, talk to me about the different

151
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,000
stepping blocks that you've gone through

152
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,840
during your time at Autodesk.

153
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,640
Well, as I said,

154
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,200
I started as a writer back in '99.

155
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,360
And what happened

156
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,760
pretty soon after I started

157
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,960
is that my manager decided

158
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,280
that she wanted me to be a manager.

159
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,840
She said she needed a manager,

160
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,840
she needed someone to manage the writers,

161
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,680
and she saw potential in me

162
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,240
for leadership and management.

163
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:05,439
And I hadn't aspired to that at all.

164
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,720
Michael, I was just,

165
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,000
I was happy doing writing.

166
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,720
And yet I said,

167
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:10,759
"Well, I'll give it a try."

168
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,639
She kind of twisted my arm.

169
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,359
And so, I started being a manager

170
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,200
of other technical writers.

171
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:18,279
And then it turned out,

172
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,039
I love that, because

173
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,439
I'm very much a people person

174
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,200
and I love the figuring out

175
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:23,999
how people tick

176
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,080
and that everyone's different

177
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,960
and that you can't manage

178
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,600
10 different people in the same way.

179
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,400
And so, I got into management

180
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,680
and then I did that for several years,

181
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,200
leading the technical writers.

182
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,480
And then I decided I was bored.

183
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,320
And I'd been doing technical writing

184
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,440
for 10 years.

185
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,520
And I've managed writers

186
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,240
for a few more years.

187
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,400
And I'm like, I want to learn

188
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,440
something totally new.

189
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,040
This is kind of how I am when I,

190
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,320
that's why I moved around so much

191
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,880
for those first 10 years.

192
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,240
I just wanted to learn new things.

193
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,120
So, I started looking around

194
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,720
for a new job,

195
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,280
both inside of Autodesk and outside.

196
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
And it turned out there was this

197
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,440
really interesting job internally

198
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,840
to lead a team of engineers

199
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,000
who were managing our software

200
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,080
for localization.

201
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,840
So, for those of you who don't know,

202
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,360
localization is actually

203
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,680
getting everything translated

204
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,120
and ready for international markets.

205
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,280
And there's this very specific software

206
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,880
that they were managing

207
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,560
that was really complex

208
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,360
and they needed a new manager

209
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,320
for the team.

210
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,960
So, I applied for that job

211
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:23,559
and that was for me,

212
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,320
a real stepping stone because,

213
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,040
you know, going from managing writers

214
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,480
where I could do the work

215
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,640
to managing engineers,

216
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,440
where I couldn't do

217
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,800
the work that they did

218
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,320
was a real big jump for me.

219
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,280
And I had to interview

220
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,160
with a zillion people to get that job.

221
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,680
And I got it.

222
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,560
So, that was my first job

223
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:43,839
out of my comfort zone, really.

224
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,639
That's incredible.

225
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,240
And I have to understand

226
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,520
a little bit better this process

227
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,160
of being a technical writer.

228
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,680
And for example,

229
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,200
taking the Photoshop version 1.0

230
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,560
guide for the layperson,

231
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,880
talk to me a little bit

232
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,640
about that process,

233
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,160
I don't think neither myself

234
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,520
nor most of my friends know really

235
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,560
what goes into writing these guides.

236
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,520
So, how does that process actually look?

237
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Yeah, and you know, it's so interesting.

238
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,760
I mean, even the terminology,

239
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,840
I don't think we even use the term

240
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,000
technical writer anymore.

241
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,800
It's often content designer,

242
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
content developer

243
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,120
is much more common now.

244
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,280
And is often seem as part of design

245
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,920
and UX and all of that.

246
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,560
But back in the day,

247
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,640
we called it technical writing.

248
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,560
But what it really is and, you know,

249
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,720
you have all,

250
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:26,279
you and everyone else,

251
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,559
whoever listens to this

252
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,639
has experienced bad technical writing.

253
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,159
It's when you buy something

254
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,759
and you get the instructions

255
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,839
and you can't follow them

256
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,959
or they're just plain wrong

257
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,279
or they don't make sense.

258
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,039
What good technical writing is,

259
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,039
is that the writer sits down

260
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,759
and truly learns the software

261
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,400
like Inside and out or whatever it is,

262
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:44,719
hardware, software.

263
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,919
I spent, and my process was

264
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,040
I would learn everything I could

265
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,120
on my own, and I would read

266
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:50,399
whatever specifications,

267
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,199
I would play with the software.

268
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,239
But then I would sit down

269
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,200
with the engineers,

270
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:56,119
the developers of the software and say,

271
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,799
explain this to me

272
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,400
so that I completely understood it,

273
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,760
and only then could I write about it.

274
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,680
Because, I mean,

275
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,240
if you've ever tried to explain something

276
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,600
you don't understand,

277
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,960
it doesn't work, right?

278
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,680
But if you understand it, you can take

279
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,480
what is complex and make it simple.

280
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,840
And I think people,

281
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,640
this is one of the things

282
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,440
I really learned,

283
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,400
and as I got better as a writer is,

284
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,680
how can you take something

285
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,480
infinitely complicated

286
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,160
and make it as simple as possible.

287
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,000
And that was always my goal.

288
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,280
Now, you mentioned to me

289
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,560
before this that, you know,

290
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,880
going back to your major,

291
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,720
drama in French, it's kind of played

292
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,040
an interesting role in your career

293
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,200
as it was unfolding

294
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,400
into the different perspectives.

295
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,040
And the skill sets that you had,

296
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,800
while they didn't seem to align

297
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,120
with the positions and what you had to,

298
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,640
would you had to use,

299
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,360
they actually were pretty beneficial.

300
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,240
Tell me a little bit about

301
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,160
how that came about.

302
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,960
Yeah, I thought about that over the years

303
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,000
because it's not necessarily obvious.

304
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,720
But, you know, one thing I think is

305
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,120
whenever you study

306
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,480
and learn a foreign language,

307
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,560
and I lived in France

308
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,960
and I'm really fluent in French,

309
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,720
so I was able to immerse myself

310
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,440
in another language and culture.

311
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,160
I think that makes you just much more

312
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,040
adaptable to different cultures

313
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,360
and different perspectives.

314
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,560
Because you've learned to think

315
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,840
in another language.

316
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,640
I think that really helps in just,

317
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,280
I mean, I've worked in

318
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,680
very international companies

319
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,160
so working with people

320
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,520
from different cultures

321
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,160
whose first language is not English.

322
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,320
And so to me,

323
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,720
it's always about communicating clearly,

324
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,640
trying to understand the other person.

325
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,160
And I think that has really

326
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,000
served me well.

327
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,720
And then from drama, I mean,

328
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,240
drama is one of these

329
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,760
underestimated skills, I think,

330
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,120
because certainly acting

331
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,440
you learn to listen

332
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,400
to the other person.

333
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,520
You learn to improvise

334
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,720
because unexpected things happen.

335
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,840
You learn to communicate in both

336
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,800
verbal and non-verbal ways.

337
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,360
And you learn,

338
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,680
I think the thing that

339
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,600
certainly stage acting and I know,

340
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,840
I never did film,

341
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,920
but I know this is true,

342
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:57,279
it's such a collaborative process.

343
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,399
You know, the actor

344
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,960
is only as good as the director

345
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,560
and the lighting and the costumes

346
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:02,879
and everything else.

347
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,719
And what I loved about theater is

348
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,039
the collaborative nature of it,

349
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,839
and I really saw the parallels

350
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,439
in developing software.

351
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,799
Because software

352
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,839
is not just the software developer,

353
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,680
it's the designer,

354
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,800
it's the product manager,

355
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,720
it's the marketing people

356
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,040
and the salespeople and those

357
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,360
technical writers and the QA people.

358
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,480
And all of that

359
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,080
is what makes a great product.

360
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,760
And that's the same in theater.

361
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
So, I think all of the skills

362
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,000
are transportable.

363
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,480
I have to look back

364
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,840
to my high school days,

365
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,760
I was a huge musical theater geek.

366
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,800
I still am a musical theater fan,

367
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,160
but I used to take part in every musical

368
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,280
and every play that we had in school.

369
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,040
My dream as a child was to be

370
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,600
an actor on stage

371
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,520
for the rest of my life.

372
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,080
It turned out that I fell in love

373
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,880
with computers and software.

374
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,680
And so, that's where I'm at now.

375
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,000
But looking back,

376
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,560
I see it in every single

377
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,280
aspect of my life.

378
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,640
I see it in my relationships,

379
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,360
I see it in the way

380
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,720
that I communicate with people,

381
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,800
this collaborative nature

382
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,360
of what you're saying

383
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,440
and you've mentioned that

384
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,400
you're only as good

385
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,240
as you are as a group.

386
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,560
And being on stage,

387
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,680
I remember in the shows,

388
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,640
you know, we were kids,

389
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,040
we've made mistakes all the time.

390
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,240
Somebody would forget their lines

391
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,600
in the middle of the play

392
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,800
or this prop would fall from the sky.

393
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,440
And we would find ourselves

394
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,560
in this situation where we realized that,

395
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,720
you know, we can't look good

396
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,960
if we distance ourselves

397
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,200
from the problem.

398
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,160
We have to go at it together.

399
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,880
And if we try to distance ourselves,

400
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,360
we're only doing harm both to ourselves

401
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,240
and to everybody else.

402
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,920
And so, I really, really appreciate

403
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,520
this insight

404
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,840
and I couldn't agree more with it.

405
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,120
Yeah, so it's not obvious

406
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
that drama and French

407
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,280
are the perfect preparation

408
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,200
to eventually become VP of engineering

409
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,400
at a software company.

410
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,280
But in my mind,

411
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,760
it couldn't have been better, honestly.

412
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,360
So, if anybody's listening to this

413
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,360
from Stanford and they're studying CS,

414
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,440
consider moving to the drama

415
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,040
or foreign language departments

416
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,840
and you'll get perhaps to the same spot.

417
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,760
But Minette, along the way,

418
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,480
you make this pretty radical transition

419
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,880
from being vice president

420
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,200
at an amazing company like Autodesk

421
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,120
to starting to speak to others

422
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,440
and to share some of the key insights

423
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,960
that you've gained along your career.

424
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,760
Some of it is about compassion,

425
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,640
about empathy, about acceptance.

426
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,320
So, what are some of those insights?

427
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,920
Well, I think I have to backtrack

428
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,960
a little bit

429
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,920
to tell you how I got to that.

430
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,560
So, we sort of stopped with my career

431
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,880
that I got to manage some engineers.

432
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,600
And then many years went by

433
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,880
and I ended up taking on

434
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,920
a series of other leadership positions

435
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,520
in the company.

436
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,440
But to get to that VP of engineering job,

437
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,480
I had gotten to a senior director role,

438
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,440
I led a big department in the company,

439
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
but to get to that VP role,

440
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,400
I had to basically,

441
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,760
the guy who was hiring

442
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,480
for that role said,

443
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,320
"You know Minette,

444
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,920
you've got a great track record here,

445
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,400
I know you're a good leader,

446
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,080
but you have two strikes against you."

447
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,400
And he was very clear

448
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,440
about those two strikes.

449
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:51,760
He said,

450
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,080
"One, you were never an engineer.

451
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,080
So, you have to gain credibility

452
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,240
with the engineering community

453
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,080
because although you've been in tech

454
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:01,279
and you are technical,

455
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,600
you weren't the one developing software.

456
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
So you've got to gain credibility."

457
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,080
And two, he said,

458
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,160
"You're a woman.

459
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,880
And the engineering leadership here

460
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,640
is a boys club.

461
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,720
And so, you're going to have

462
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:14,199
to break into the boys club."

463
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,720
And so what happened is

464
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,160
I did not get the job right away.

465
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,080
I had to do a 90 day trial.

466
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,400
And during those 90 day,

467
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,960
yeah, I did an acting role.

468
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,400
So, I was acting VP for three months.

469
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,640
And yeah,

470
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,920
and during those three months,

471
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,320
I basically had to win the endorsements

472
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,720
of all the engineering leaders

473
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,600
in the company.

474
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,760
And they happened, at that time,

475
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,520
to be all men.

476
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:35,879
Wow.

477
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,240
So, you were acting VP for three months.

478
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,280
You have to get the acceptance

479
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,880
of that boys club.

480
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,240
Okay. That's incredible.

481
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,480
Go on.

482
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,360
So, I did.

483
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,640
I mean, it's a long story,

484
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:47,719
but I eventually,

485
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,600
I did get that role

486
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,360
and I did that role

487
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,840
for about five years.

488
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,560
And during the time,

489
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,800
and my goal,

490
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,840
what I was basically assigned to do

491
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,480
was to transform engineering at Autodesk,

492
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,440
which is, you can imagine, a huge task.

493
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,760
It was about 9,000 people

494
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,560
when I was there,

495
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,800
about 3,500 engineers.

496
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,480
And I realized none of this

497
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,000
is a technical problem.

498
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,840
I mean we had a lot of issues,

499
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,840
we had all these different platforms

500
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,040
and we had to really consolidate tools.

501
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,960
But it was a behavioral issue,

502
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,200
it was a people issue

503
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,680
and it was culture.

504
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,720
It was all about culture

505
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,240
and how we behaved.

506
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,360
And I got, as in that role is like,

507
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,880
yeah, I had a great staff,

508
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,040
I had very technical people

509
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,360
working under me,

510
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,680
but what I needed to do

511
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,240
was really talk about

512
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,680
how are we going to behave differently,

513
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,120
how are we going to collaborate,

514
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,240
how are we going to work

515
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,400
more effectively together.

516
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,080
And so I got myself a

517
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,120
big education really

518
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,360
through reading and being online

519
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,960
and just reading a zillion books

520
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,480
about human behavior.

521
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,800
And I also became a real advocate

522
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,760
for women and for people of color,

523
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,160
because even though I am a white woman,

524
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,600
I was very much in the minority

525
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,120
because engineering is so male.

526
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,920
And so, I often felt other,

527
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,200
I often felt like I didn't fit in,

528
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,320
like I wasn't included.

529
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,640
And I wanted to change that.

530
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,800
And so, when I finally left Autodesk

531
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,800
after 20 years, I left last year,

532
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,360
I realized, you know,

533
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,720
Autodesk is a great company,

534
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,960
but they're struggling with this,

535
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,240
all the companies

536
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,760
are struggling with inclusion.

537
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,680
Diversity, inclusion and equity.

538
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,280
And so, I wanted to bring my perspective

539
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,840
and my experience

540
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,200
and help others do better around this.

541
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Because, honestly,

542
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,160
everyone's struggling

543
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,440
and everyone needs help with that.

544
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,000
Minette, you're vice president

545
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,040
in the engineering space.

546
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,120
3,500 engineers at Autodesk

547
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,600
and you're coming, you're saying,

548
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,440
talking about how this is

549
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,480
a behavioral problem,

550
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,680
its culture at the end.

551
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,720
And of course, you know, in 2020,

552
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,280
we've seen that not just in tech,

553
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,240
but around the world

554
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,520
of how big of a part

555
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,000
culture plays into our life

556
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,720
and into our ability to thrive

557
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,000
just as a planet,

558
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,800
and as a global community.

559
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,760
And I'd love for you to share

560
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,160
a little bit more into the insights

561
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,640
of how do you build a healthy culture

562
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,920
both in large, large corporation

563
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,640
like Autodesk,

564
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,240
but also in a small startup?

565
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,080
And I'm looking specifically

566
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,280
selfish insights for me

567
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,360
as I'm about to start

568
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
my own entrepreneurial journey

569
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,080
and for all of my friends

570
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,400
that are in their journey,

571
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,720
what are some key insights

572
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,520
that you've gained about behavior

573
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,320
and about culture

574
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,680
and diversity and inclusion?

575
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,960
Yeah.

576
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,120
Well, there's so much

577
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,640
and it is kind of hard to know

578
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,280
where to start.

579
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,439
But what I will say is that

580
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,640
the leaders really set the tone.

581
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,840
And I think, especially,

582
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,960
big companies and small,

583
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,440
but when you're a startup,

584
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,640
often, and I've seen this,

585
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,400
so much startups are going really fast.

586
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:43,840
We're going to build

587
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,680
something really cool,

588
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:45,999
we're going to get it out there,

589
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,039
we're going to try to get investment,

590
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,719
we're going to try to get customers,

591
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,600
and then later even, you know,

592
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,240
even with a startup, they'll say,

593
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,360
Oh, look, we're all men.

594
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,480
Now, we got to hire some women

595
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,960
and how are we going to do that?

596
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,640
And it's almost too late,

597
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,320
even if you're just a handful of men,

598
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,560
because, do the women

599
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,320
want to come work there,

600
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,600
do the people of color

601
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,080
want to come work there.

602
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,600
So, I think that whether

603
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,080
you're large or small,

604
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,360
starting up or a 30 year old company,

605
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,520
you need to be intentional

606
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
and the leaders need to set the tone

607
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,960
of being inclusive,

608
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,040
and what that means

609
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,160
in terms of leadership,

610
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,680
and this is a lot

611
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,480
of the work that I do is that

612
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,760
leaders are not omniscient

613
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,920
and they need to admit

614
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,720
what they don't know.

615
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,320
They need to be vulnerable.

616
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:26,559
They need to be open to listening.

617
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,319
And honestly, that is so much of what

618
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,439
I think the problem is right now

619
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,680
is that people don't know how to listen

620
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:35,559
to their diverse employees

621
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,799
and to hear their true experiences.

622
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,239
And I've experienced this myself.

623
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,319
A senior executive will say,

624
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,959
"Don't bring me problems,

625
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,760
bring me solutions."

626
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,079
But honestly,

627
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,879
you need to hear the problems

628
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,679
before you can even attempt

629
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,759
the solutions.

630
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,759
And you need to be uncomfortable

631
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,639
with that listening.

632
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,519
You need to be willing

633
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,440
to be uncomfortable and to say,

634
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,960
I don't have all the answers,

635
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,360
but I'm willing to listen

636
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:03,279
and I'm going to make sure

637
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,680
that this is a safe place

638
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,760
where everyone's voice can be heard.

639
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,120
And to me, that is

640
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,080
the number one thing is that

641
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,160
we have to make it safe.

642
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,200
And people do not feel safe today

643
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,960
speaking up and telling their truth.

644
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,320
Right.

645
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,680
And I love your take on

646
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,200
being intentional about as a leader

647
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,960
and being vocal about it,

648
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,320
and being willing to be uncomfortable

649
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,600
with the problem.

650
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,320
And not just sugarcoating it

651
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,960
or shrugging it aside.

652
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,040
I think it's wonderful.

653
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,640
How do you then make the impact now?

654
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,240
So, you've left Autodesk.

655
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,640
Part of the motivation

656
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,240
from what I'm hearing from you is

657
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,080
understand that you've made

658
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,960
an incredible impact

659
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,000
at your company, Autodesk.

660
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,240
Then, this is a global problem

661
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,720
along with many companies,

662
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,560
and you're now looking

663
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,560
to make that impact there.

664
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,200
So, how do you go about doing that?

665
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,600
Yeah.

666
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:53,959
Well, I started my own

667
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,000
consulting business

668
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,480
this summer during covid

669
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,560
because what else do you do

670
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,040
during covid, right?

671
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,200
I took a break and then realized

672
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,400
that's what I wanted to do.

673
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,840
But I've also, for many years,

674
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,320
even when I was at Autodesk,

675
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,480
I was a keynote speaker

676
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,960
internally and externally.

677
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,360
So I've been doing recently

678
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,560
a fair number of keynotes

679
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,240
that there's a real appetite

680
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,320
to hear about diversity and inclusion.

681
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,000
And so, I had one last month,

682
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,400
I have one this next Friday.

683
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,080
So, I'm trying to get the word out.

684
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,840
But I do have a new client

685
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,800
and that's a start up,

686
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,520
and they're realizing

687
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,760
that they may have an issue

688
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,800
with equity and with inclusion.

689
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,240
And so, we're just starting

690
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,280
the conversations.

691
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,400
And so, I'm doing both

692
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,280
just the one on one engagements

693
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,760
with smaller, large companies,

694
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,200
and that's just starting.

695
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,680
And then, I'm also giving talks

696
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,720
because I feel like people

697
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,280
just need to hear.

698
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,760
And one of the things is that

699
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,320
I will be honest in those talks.

700
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,720
I'm not going to sugarcoat things

701
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,120
and say that it's all perfect

702
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,480
and I'll share

703
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,640
my own experiences as well.

704
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,120
I love that.

705
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,280
Minette, I want to thank you

706
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,080
for being so generous with your time.

707
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,720
Before we go, I have to ask

708
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,160
the most important question.

709
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,280
Three words that you would use

710
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,160
to describe yourself.

711
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,400
All right.

712
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,880
I have to start with authentic,

713
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,080
because you only get one Minette.

714
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,520
I don't have different personas

715
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,840
for different environments.

716
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,560
It's I'm always going to be real.

717
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,240
So, authentic.

718
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,200
Empathetic.

719
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,320
I can't even turn off my empathy.

720
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,680
And that's both a blessing and a curse.

721
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,600
So, if you start crying, it's likely

722
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,240
that I'm going to be crying with you.

723
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,800
But, you know,

724
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,680
that's just who I am.

725
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,319
And then the third is,

726
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,240
I don't know if I would say

727
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,640
energetic or enthusiastic,

728
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,920
I'll go with enthusiastic.

729
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,040
Because I've just got a lot of,

730
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,040
I've got so much oomph

731
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,520
and I have so much I want to share

732
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,560
and I want to help people

733
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,240
and I want to get at it.

734
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,800
Wonderful.

735
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Minette, thank you so much.

736
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,000
This is wonderful.

737
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:42,319
Continue making a positive impact

738
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,879
in helping companies

739
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,599
regain the equity and diverse nature

740
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,799
that they all deserve and we all deserve.

741
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,959
And I look forward to seeking your advice

742
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,199
when I'm starting my own venture

743
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,919
to make sure that I properly

744
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
I'm leading by example

745
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,960
and being intentional about it.

746
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,520
So, thank you.

747
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,000
Thank you.

748
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,680
I would love to continue that with you.

749
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,120
Michael, thanks so much.

750
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,480
Take care.
