1
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,300
All right. Neil Schloss, 
thank you so much

2
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,700
for joining on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,700
Good to be here. Thank you.

4
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,700
So wonderful, so gracious of you 
to give me your time, Neil.

5
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,700
You have one 
of the most impressive

6
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,700
careers that I’ve come across -- 
36 years at Ford.

7
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,700
You’ve seen so much 
that I don’t know how we can try

8
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,700
to summarize this in 20 minutes. 
But I’m going to try.

9
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,000
And I'd love to spend this time 
learning from you what it means

10
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
to be at an amazing company 
like Ford over these years,

11
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,700
seeing these incredible 
technological transformations

12
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:19,700
as you go through, 
seeing the great recession of 2008

13
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,300
as you’re taking part 
as an active CFO of the

14
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,700
Ford Mobility subsidiary, 
but also helping the Ford company

15
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,000
secure some huge liquidity 
to help go through this crisis.

16
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,700
Neil, let’s start off with you. 
How did you even get to Ford?

17
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,700
And how did you end 
spending 36 years there?

18
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:43,700
Yeah, there’s a luck piece. 
There’s a faith piece

19
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,700
that puts you in the right place 
at the right time.

20
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,700
But born and raised in San Diego. 
I went to San Diego State.

21
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,700
Was intending to be 
a chemistry major.

22
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:59,700
And after I couldn’t get through 
Calculus with any meaningful grades,

23
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,700
I decided it’s probably 
not the best place to be

24
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,700
as far as the business. 
So, I took an econ course.

25
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,700
I said this was pretty cool stuff. 
And so, I picked up

26
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,700
the finance skillset 
in undergrad.

27
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,700
And coming out of school in 1982, 
which was the end of the --

28
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,700
sort of the -- 
not depression,

29
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,700
but clearly an economic recession 
that was going on,

30
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,000
Ford was the only one hiring. 
And so, I got the one offer

31
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,300
coming out of school. 
They were hiring in their aerospace

32
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,700
division, which was in Palo Alto.

33
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,700
Wow.

34
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,700
And so, I actually started 
with Ford in Palo Alto.

35
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,700
So, being born and raised 
in San Diego, moving north,

36
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,700
spent five years 
or so in the bay area,

37
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,700
then to Southern California 
before the aerospace.

38
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,700
And then, we sold the business 
and had a chance to stay

39
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,700
with Loral who was 
the acquirer or move to Detroit.

40
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,700
And who knew what 
Detroit would be like.

41
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,700
So, moving from 70 degrees 
and sunny every day to --

42
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,300
when I moved in January,

43
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,300
- it’s to white snow on the ground. 
- Wow.

44
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,000
It was a bit of a culture shock.
 And then spent 30 years here

45
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
in Detroit with them, 
or 28 years with them.

46
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I’ve been here now 
30 years in a variety

47
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,700
of different finance roles. 
Joined the treasury organization

48
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,700
about a year and a half 
into my tenure here.

49
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,000
Fell in love with the markets. 
Fell in love with the ability

50
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,700
to get sort of real-time 
performance reviews.

51
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,700
So, every day, 
you are in the market trading.

52
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,700
You were getting -- 
at the end of the day,

53
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,700
you knew if you did 
a good job or not.

54
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Wow.

55
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,000
And I think the external focus 
was also an important aspect

56
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,700
that most big companies --
your jobs are focused internally.

57
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,000
And the treasury roles 
tended to be with investors,

58
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,700
with banks, with advisors. 
So, it’s much more an external

59
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,000
focus to the lot of treasury, 
different roles.

60
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,700
And then, got my dream job 
in March of ’07 when I became

61
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,700
treasurer for the company. 
Had a team of about

62
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,000
300 folks globally.

63
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,700
Wow! Of Ford?

64
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,000
Hmm?

65
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,700
- Of Ford, right?
- Of Ford, yeah.

66
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,700
Unbelievable.

67
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,000
In the US center, 
and then three different

68
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,700
international centers in China, 
in Brazil, then in Europe.

69
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,300
Hold on. So, you’re -- 
the treasurer of the company

70
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:31,700
in 2007, which is a fabulous time 
to become the treasurer of a huge,

71
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,700
huge company that’s about to be 
hit like every other company,

72
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,700
and I believe without bailout, 
you helped the company go through

73
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,700
this crisis, raising $23 billion 
in liquidity.

74
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,700
Talk to me about this. 
Paint me a picture.

75
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,700
I was just a little kid. 
I was actually in the stock market

76
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,700
class of December  of ’08 
when my teacher --

77
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
he was my Math teacher as well,

78
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,700
[Joe Liss]. He walks in, and says, 
“Kids, just so you know,

79
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,700
you’re going to be 
telling about this class,

80
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,700
about today, to your grandkids 
when you’re older because this is

81
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,700
one of the most unique moments 
in history that you get to be

82
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,700
in the stock market class 
during this crisis.

83
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,000
I had the privilege 
of playing with Excel,

84
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
with makeshift investments. 
You had to be

85
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,700
the treasurer of Ford.
Talk to me about this crisis.

86
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,000
I think it goes back really 
when I was in the

87
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,700
system treasure back in ’06. 
It was when we did

88
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,000
the financing deck 
and the large home improvement loan

89
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,700
that everybody talks about, 
the $23 billion.

90
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,000
It was done in December 2006. 
Because it was actually

91
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,700
before the financial crisis, 
before the auto crisis,

92
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,700
we were having our own issues 
that were unique to the company

93
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,700
as well as a starting 
of a slowdown in the industry.

94
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,700
We raised $23 billion. 
And I remember

95
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,000
several meetings that -- 
it’s, “How much can we get?

96
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,700
How much can you take?” 
And one thing you’ll learn

97
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,000
in a cyclical industry 
as a treasurer is you take money

98
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,700
when people want to give it to you, 
not when you need it.

99
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,000
- I’ve heard this so many times.
- And that’s true today

100
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,800
by the way as well.

101
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,800
If I think about start-ups 
and think about the venture world

102
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,800
in a crisis like this, 
the people who took money

103
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,000
early are in much better position 
than those that didn’t.

104
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,700
And you take money when people 
want to give it to you,

105
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,700
and not when you need it.

106
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,700
- So, we needed there --
- And when you need it,

107
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,700
you never get it.

108
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,300
So, along this line -- 
because it seems a little bit

109
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,300
contradicting sometimes 
when you think of the lean

110
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,700
startup bootstrapping. 
Don’t give away too much equity.

111
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,700
Hold onto to what you can and try 
to power through,

112
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,700
you're actually --

113
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,700
You and a lot of other really, 
really incredible

114
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,700
people are saying, 
“No, no. No.

115
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,000
This is a cyclical market. 
You’re going to have a rainy day.

116
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Make sure you have enough capital 
to power through whatever happens,”

117
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,700
like COVID, 
like the great recession.

118
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,000
Yeah. And I think you have to look 
at it from the standpoint of --

119
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
maybe we can get into this later. 
But I think you have look at it

120
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
from the standpoint of who your 
customers and your clients are.

121
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It’s not your business 
that's necessarily --

122
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
that's -- you know,
you're susceptible

123
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,700
to your own risks. 
But if your clients are impacted

124
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,000
by economic recession, 
in which case, your business --

125
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,700
your revenue goes away, 
it’s more than just

126
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,000
your own business, because it's 
to your customer risks.

127
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,700
But anyway, back to ’07. 
The auto industry started

128
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,000
to have problems in ’07.
The banking industry started

129
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
with Bear Stearns in March of ’08. 
AIG and Lehman

130
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,700
in September of ’08. 
The auto task force was set up,

131
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,700
the congressional hearings. 
And we didn’t know

132
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,000
where things were going to end. 
So, we went through a huge amount

133
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,700
of work in a period of ’06 to ’09, 
basically buttoned down as much as

134
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,700
we could to raise 
as much funding as we could.

135
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,700
We did equity swaps. 
We took that out

136
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,700
at pennies on a dollar, 
which I hope to never do again.

137
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,700
We drew on our credit revolver.

138
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,700
- Wow.
- And when it came down to --

139
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,700
I guess May of ’09 
when Chrysler went under,

140
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,700
and then, soon thereafter GM, 
the key for us was making sure

141
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,000
we kept the liquidity we needed, 
but also that the supply base

142
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,700
had its liquidity because 
if the supply base were to go,

143
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,000
you couldn’t sustain yourself. 
And so, I think it was better

144
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
to be lucky than good. 
In some cases, we raised

145
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
enough money early enough. 
We were creative

146
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
on how we did things. 
We had a management team

147
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,700
that was focused on product line 
and prioritizing what vehicles

148
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,700
we needed to produce by when.

149
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,700
And I think the 
leadership team all --

150
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,700
We met every single day --

151
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,000
- Wow.
- Held hands and --

152
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,700
―not literally, but figuratively―
held hands and fought through it

153
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,700
and did what we could do to keep 
us from having to go under.

154
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:46,700
So, I mean how do you go about 
thousands of employees are unsure

155
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,000
of what’s happening? 
You’re saying you meet every day

156
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,700
as a leadership team, 
which means that every day

157
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,700
there’s new insights, 
there’s new decisions

158
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,700
and new adaptations. 
How do you actually --

159
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,300
and you’re in charge 
of a division of 300 people.

160
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:58,900
Yup.

161
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:03,000
How do you even communicate 
this crisis and optimism,

162
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,700
realistic pessimism?

163
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,700
Yeah. Today, actually, would be 
a lot easier because you can just

164
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,700
set up a Zoom 
and you can talk to 300 people.

165
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,700
Get everybody on and you can give
everybody sort of daily updates

166
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,700
or you could do 
five-minute videos to send out.

167
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,700
I think the technology today 
would have made it easier.

168
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Unfortunately, we also see 
companies who are

169
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,700
it’s too easy. And you know,

170
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,200
- we've seen
- Yeah.

171
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,700
some pretty 
nasty lay-offs recently, yeah.

172
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,000
When you go through crisis, 
it’s better to over-communicate

173
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,700
than under-communicate.

174
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,700
Yes.

175
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,700
I think the other piece -- 
and I think this is something

176
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,700
I probably didn’t 
know enough early on.

177
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:44,700
But I think that the ability 
to show calm, show confidence --

178
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,700
you obviously have to empathize 
with those folks that are

179
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:54,700
going to lose their jobs. 
You have to show positive emotion,

180
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,700
that you know what you’re doing, 
you’re confident in what

181
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,000
you’re doing because you need -- 
you’re not doing the work.

182
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So, as a leader you’re not 
physically doing the work.

183
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And so, you need your team 
to be energized, to believe

184
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,700
in the cause and to know that 
their leaders are taking care

185
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,000
of them and providing 
the oversight and guidance

186
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
and strategic direction. 
But they have to physically feel

187
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,700
that they want to do the work 
and they want to be successful

188
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,000
because the heart and minds will 
follow  if you have good leaders.

189
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And I think we had 
a great leadership

190
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,700
team headed by Arnold Riley 
and the support of the board

191
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,700
for what we were trying to do, 
which was to survive.

192
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,700
- As a leader, did you --?
- We didn't know what tomorrow --

193
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,000
You know, we took every -- 
I mean I just remember some

194
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,700
of the conversations I had at home 
when I came home --

195
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,700
you come home late, 
you get in early,

196
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,700
and just talking to my wife 
not knowing exactly what tomorrow

197
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,000
was going to bring, 
and whether or not

198
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,700
we would survive.

199
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,700
That’s just fascinating. 
And Neil, did you ever have

200
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,700
as a leader, some moments 
where you had to portray

201
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,000
optimism even though 
deep inside, you’re like,

202
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,700
“Oh, wow! I’m not actually sure -- 
I’m not actually sure about this”?

203
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,700
I’m not a sugar coater. 
So, from the standpoint

204
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,700
of giving somebody a bunch of BS 
just to keep them happy

205
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,700
is not my character. 
It’s not my leadership style.

206
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,700
I’m transparent 
and that’s going to be --

207
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,700
I’m very transparent 
in how I feel, in how I act.

208
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,700
And I think from my perspective, 
you can do it with the reason

209
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,700
you’re doing stuff, 
the mode, in which

210
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,700
you’re doing stuff, the emotion. 
You have to stay balanced

211
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,700
because you lose it 
if you’re over --

212
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,700
if you’re cheerleader every day 
of the week

213
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
and you’re cheerleading, 
your team won’t believe it.

214
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Right.

215
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,500
If you blow up all the time and -- 
you know, they won’t believe it.

216
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,700
And so, you have to show balance 
in what you’re doing.

217
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,700
And I -- when I got angry 
and when I would explode,

218
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,300
they took me seriously 
because it did not

219
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,700
happen very often. 
And it was --

220
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,000
even though you try not to, 
you try to avoid

221
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,300
making it personal, that’s hard. 
But I do think

222
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,700
you have to be balanced. 
You have to be transparent

223
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,700
in everything you do 
because shadow of a leader

224
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,700
is a real concept. 
People will follow

225
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,700
and behave the way you behave.

226
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,700
- Definitely.
- If you're a jerk

227
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,700
they’ll be a jerk 
because you got ahead.

228
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,700
So, by definition, 
it pays to be a jerk, right?

229
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,700
And so, from that perspective 
you got to really be aware

230
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,700
that people are watching 
everything you do --

231
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,700
Right.

232
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:46,700
-- all the time, what you say, 
how you do it. Non-verbal

233
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,000
is just as important as verbal, 
maybe more so

234
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,700
because people tend to believe 
your non-verbal more than

235
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,700
they believe your verbal.

236
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,700
Right.

237
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,700
But those, I think -- 
that sort of --

238
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,700
you got to get through it, 
but they got to believe you.

239
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,700
- I'm looking back...
- Then, they’re going to follow.

240
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,700
I’m looking back at my time 
as a team leader in the army,

241
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,700
And I’m thinking -- 
one of the big lessons

242
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,000
that I’ve learned was that 
I wanted to be the best

243
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,700
all the time. And so, I would -- 
I always communicated that

244
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,700
whatever we’re doing always 
critically important

245
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,700
and it’s important 
that we meet every milestone.

246
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,700
And looking back, 
I can see exactly

247
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,700
what you’re saying 
that at some point,

248
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,700
these words of this is critical, 
this is important,

249
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,000
they’re starting to lose value 
because not everything

250
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,700
can be important. 
And I think that --

251
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,000
And now I’ve realized 
that as a leader,

252
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
it was my responsibility 
also to know how to delegate

253
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,700
the importance of 
the different tasks

254
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,700
so that when there is something 
that’s really urgent,

255
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,700
they’ll take it seriously 
because all of a sudden,

256
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
a year into it, 
there was something

257
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,000
that was really urgent and I said, 
and they’re like,

258
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
“Yeah, but last week 
was urgent, too, and two weeks ago

259
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,700
was also urgent." 
So, as a leader,

260
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,700
you have to balance. I love that.
But, Neil, one of  --

261
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,000
You also have to find that time 
where you can go

262
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,700
away from everybody.

263
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,700
Mm-hmm.

264
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,700
and explode.

265
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,700
[laughter]

266
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
Right?

267
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,700
Or express feelings 
and emotions --

268
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,700
and my wife took a burden
of a couple of them.

269
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,700
And when you come home, 
the little teeny things

270
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,700
that you’ve been built up 
and built up and built up,

271
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,700
you explode. 
But for me, it was biking.

272
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,700
For me, it was Shabbat, 
I mean shutting down

273
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,700
for 25 hours was 
critical to being able to

274
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,700
to stay focused.

275
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah, I know. I think I read 
somewhere that you mentioned

276
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
that your co-workers, 
when it hit three 3PM on a Friday,

277
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,700
they would look at the clock, 
and say, “Neil, I think it’s

278
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,700
time for Shabbat. 
Please go home,”

279
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,700
- which is a little bit --
- I had a boss -- I had a boss

280
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,700
that did that once 
in a meeting, and said,

281
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
“Don’t you need to leave?” 
It was great.

282
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
Incredible. Incredible. 
Now I think I --

283
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,700
you know, just unders --
like empathizing

284
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,700
with your co-workers 
and understanding

285
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,700
the different circumstances. 
That’s wonderful.

286
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,700
And I’m imagining there weren’t 
too many observant Jews in Ford,

287
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
especially, in executive 
positions back then.

288
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,700
So, I think 
that’s really remarkable.

289
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:04,700
Nope, there wasn’t but they 
were over the top on

290
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,700
supporting what I was doing.

291
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,700
Amazing. Neil, you mentioned also 
that you’re not a big car guy.

292
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,700
Or you didn’t grow up 
a huge car guy,

293
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:18,700
yet you spent 36 years in Ford, 
in a car company, obviously.

294
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,700
So, are you a car guy now 
or are you still more of a --

295
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,700
economics guy 
that helped lead a huge company?

296
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,700
It’s funny because I wasn’t 
a car guy and I never claimed

297
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,700
to be because -- 
I like to drive cars

298
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,700
but do I care how they operate; 
do I care how they work?

299
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,700
I really don’t, right?
And that was an odd ball at Ford

300
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,700
because you had people 
who collected cars, who --

301
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,700
I had a boss at one point 
who had an old Ford pick-up truck,

302
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,700
like in the 1930-some 
odd pick-up truck.

303
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,700
And he and his brother 
would build it,

304
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,700
and then take it apart, 
and then build it,

305
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,700
and take it apart. 
And it was just like

306
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,700
I could never understand. 
That to me was just like, “Why?”

307
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:06,700
But it’s funny now because what 
I’m doing now post-Ford

308
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:12,700
is all about automotive 2.0. 
It’s all about how transportation

309
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:17,700
is evolving, how mobility 
is evolving. And so, I really --

310
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,700
I’m not a car guy, 
but I am now

311
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,700
becoming a transportation, 
an efficient transportation

312
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,700
person who really -- 
I can dig. I can really dig into

313
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,700
now the technology, 
how things are working.

314
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,900
Help people move 
from spot A to point B --

315
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,700
- Right. 
- And...

316
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,700
-- on that. And so, where I wasn’t 
a technical car guy before,

317
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,700
I’m becoming much more 
of a transportation

318
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,700
auto person today.

319
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,700
- Where is this going?
- And I’m spending most of my time

320
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,700
doing that.

321
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,700
Where is transportation going? 
What are like the big things

322
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,000
that you’re passionate about 
and you’re saying like,

323
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,700
“Wow. This is crazy.

324
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:58,700
Well, I think it was all headed 
toward sort of micro-mobility,

325
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,700
shared mobility, unique use 
cases, and how people travel

326
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,700
from point A to point B, 
whether it's everything from

327
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:12,700
using your legs to spaceships. 
Right? That mode of transportation

328
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,200
is now just not when -- you know, 
I grew up and I spent 36 years

329
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,200
working on manufacturing, assembly 
or designing, manufacturing,

330
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,000
selling, financing cars, was 
the transportation business model.

331
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,700
That was automotive 1.0.

332
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,700
And you lost touch 
with the customer

333
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,700
post either the dealer 
relationship and/or the warranty --

334
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,700
Right.

335
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,000
-- and you didn’t really get the 
customer until they needed

336
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,700
a transportation. 
So, it was very narrow.

337
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,700
That whole thing has been expanded 
to what services can I provide?

338
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,700
How do I add different 
modes of transportation,

339
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,700
the whole public service 
transportation is a broken model.

340
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,000
Cities are a broken model. 
There are so many things

341
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,700
from an efficiency perspective 
that we can create

342
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,700
that the startup world is 
just like hitting home runs on --

343
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,700
from the standpoint of improving 
the way this was all going.

344
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,700
And there are so many different 
technologies that are being

345
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,700
developed that -- you know,
some will work, and some won’t.

346
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,700
And some won’t work because 
they have a great technology,

347
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,000
but they haven’t figured out 
the business model for which

348
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,700
that technology could be utilized. 
So, where is it going?

349
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,700
Who the heck knows?

350
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,700
- Who knows?
- It’s going. It’s going.

351
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,700
And I think we have to 
take it step by step.

352
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,300
Obviously, there's
electronic vehicles, new battery.

353
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,700
There's autonomous vehicles will 
come at some point.

354
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,700
Right now, there’s a lot 
of technology to make that happen

355
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,700
in an efficient way, 
but there’s a lot of work

356
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,700
to be done yet 
on all the used cases

357
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,700
from the standpoint 
of who’s making those decisions

358
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,000
on what you hit priority-wise. 
You know, if you can --

359
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,700
if you hit an old lady, or be 
hitting a fire hydrant, right?

360
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,700
Those are decisions 
that people have to make.

361
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,700
It’s not a computer that’s going 
to make those decisions.

362
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,700
- And those are tough decisions.
- [unclear] what’s fascinating,

363
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,700
I took an ethics and AI class

364
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,000
at Stanford and one of 
the fascinating things

365
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,700
that came up was that, 
“Yes, the humans need to decide

366
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,700
whether you hit 
the fire hydrant or the person.

367
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,700
But at the end also, 
there’s the famous

368
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,700
trolley problem of 
do you push a button

369
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,700
to switch the train tracks 
to hit an older person,

370
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,700
rather than the baby on the tracks.
And it turns out that also

371
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,700
different countries have 
different skills of

372
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,000
what they’re willing to do. 
I believe MIT did a huge study

373
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
on this and I think 
it’s a fascinating world

374
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,700
we’re going to. 
And  you mentioned start-ups.

375
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,700
So, now you’re also very involved 
with J-Ventures as an LP and --

376
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,700
Yup.

377
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,700
helping start-ups. 
So, how do you transition now

378
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,000
from 36 years at Ford 
to helping start-ups

379
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,700
and looking towards this future?
I think it's pretty crazy.

380
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah. I mean the transition for me 
happened in my last two years

381
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,700
at Ford when I was really helping. 
I left the treasury role,

382
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,000
was the CFO of Ford Mobility 
and Ford Mobility,

383
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
when I came on board, 
had five employees

384
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,700
and we were just getting started. 
So, it was like a start-up

385
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,700
inside of Ford --

386
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,200
Yeah.

387
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,000
-- which has its own issues. 
And so, I was employee number 5,

388
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,700
I think, or thereabouts. 
And we then would often --

389
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
we bought four 
different companies.

390
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,700
We started our own

391
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
- Wow.
- businesses.

392
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,000
And so, we were a start-up 
inside and sort of

393
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,700
operating that way. 
And so, transitioning

394
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,700
from the treasury role 
in the financing business

395
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,700
into the mobility business 
became sort of a nice transition

396
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,700
point to retirement from Ford, 
and starting to work heavily

397
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,300
into the start-up world, 
focusing obviously

398
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,700
on the automotive 
business on mobility.

399
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,700
And got lucky 
and got connected

400
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,700
to a couple of start-ups 
where I joined their boards.

401
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,700
I’m doing something 
with a bank to capitalize

402
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,000
on my treasury skills as well. 
And then, J-Ventures,

403
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,700
I got introduced to Oded 
sort of the end of last,

404
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:02,700
last year through an existing LP. 
And that’s been six, seven

405
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,700
months now.  It’s been great. 
I’ve met a lot of folks.

406
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,700
The networking, 
the quality of the team,

407
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,700
both in J-Ventures but also  
the LPs are just phenomenal.

408
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,700
A hundred percent.

409
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,700
And the ability to learn 
from people in this business

410
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,700
and to make new friends, 
and to make new acquaintances,

411
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,700
and open more doors, 
it’s been great.

412
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,700
I love it. I love it. 
Neil, I can’t believe

413
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,700
20 minutes are almost up. 
But I have to ask

414
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,700
the most important question -- 
three words that best describe you.

415
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,700
Well, I’ve used transparent already 
once or twice in this discussion.

416
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,700
So, I’ll probably use that one 
again from a standpoint of --

417
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,700
I'm a transp --

418
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,000
you know, it’s all --

419
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,700
for me, it’s all about leadership.

420
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,700
And so, it’s about 
being transparent.

421
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,700
It’s about being honest. 
And I would say, mentor

422
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,700
would be the third one. 
And again, it gets

423
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:59,000
to -- my leadership philosophy 
is helping others get to where

424
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,700
they need to go, 
which is mentorship piece of it.

425
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,000
Being transparent, 
so there’s no doubt

426
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
about where you are. 
There’s no question about

427
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,700
what your objectives are. 
And then, honesty is sort of a --

428
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,700
you can’t do any of that stuff 
if you’re not honest.

429
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,000
Transparent, honest and mentor. 
I love it. Neil,

430
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,700
thank you so much. 
Toda raba. This was wonderful.

431
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,700
I learned so, so much. 
And I’ll see you around J-Ventures.

432
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,700
Hopefully, in person.

433
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,000
I would definitely love so. 
Thank you.

434
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,700
All right. Take care, man.
