1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,960
Five years from now,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,920
each one of us is going to get

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,280
a food that is relevant

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,320
on his personal biomarkers,

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,200
it might be DNA,

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,120
it might be physiological data

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,720
that you derived from smartwatches,

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,960
wearables, like sleeping quality,

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,700
HRV, a body battery, etc.

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,560
Rachel, thank you for joining me.

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,080
How are you?

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,120
Wonderful.

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,840
Thank you so much.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,080
Where are you calling from right now?

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,280
So currently, I'm in Tel Aviv,

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,720
the best city in the world.

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,840
But, you know, we are spread over

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,320
in New York, California, and Tel Aviv.

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,640
All over the places.

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,300
Definitely.

21
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:08,440
With Zoom, it's so easy.

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,920
Definitely. So, you know,

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,680
right now you're running myAir

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,560
in the food tech industry.

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,120
But you have such a vast experience

26
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,440
with food tech.

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,280
Vice president at Teva,

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,280
but also experience

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,920
with Strauss and with Nestlé

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,280
and so many other companies.

31
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,480
So, what I was asking

32
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,320
was tell me a little bit about

33
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,080
your journey into food tech

34
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,960
and why that industry.

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,480
And what is so exciting to you

36
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,720
about food technology?

37
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,680
Well, actually, 20 years ago when I

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,560
started my own journey

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,040
at the food industry,

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,640
it was working for Nestlé in Brazil.

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,360
I did some consultancy projects

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,840
after my MBA in France.

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,840
And I discovered the world of food

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,000
and fell in love immediately.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,360
But back then, you know,

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,400
our KPIs were more about

47
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,960
taking out all the baddies.

48
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,920
You know, we were talking

49
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,880
about quality instead of quantity

50
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,040
and talking about

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,800
taking out all the baddies

52
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,920
like oil, salt, sugar.

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,440
And when I worked for Nestlé,

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,920
for example, I had these KPIs

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,760
from the snacks.

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,240
So, I needed to make

57
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,720
some healthier snacks.

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,600
That was actually

59
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,480
the first generation of food.

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,680
The second generation of food

61
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,120
was more about functional food.

62
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,680
Food that works for me,

63
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,440
food that really brings me values

64
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,120
and that was the probiotic words.

65
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,040
For example, we have Activia,

66
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,880
Actimel, the known product

67
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,240
is a very good example for probiotics.

68
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,200
And we now are very familiar

69
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,360
with all the protein bars.

70
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,920
Right.

71
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,760
RX revolution.

72
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,800
Instead of using powders,

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,880
just eat it and that's it.

74
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,800
But that was

75
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,240
the second generation of food.

76
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,600
The third generation of food

77
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,040
is actually a personal food

78
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,680
that works for me.

79
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,120
And we call it in myAir, food for mood.

80
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:06,160
And the consumers are so smart

81
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,240
and they understand

82
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,280
that each one of us is different

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,640
and one size does not fit all.

84
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,840
So, each one of us deserve

85
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,320
a different and precise solution

86
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,400
for his own body.

87
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,280
And this is what we are working on

88
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,840
at myAir food tech.

89
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,280
Food for moods,

90
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,040
which based on personalized nutrition.

91
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,880
So, I'd love to talk

92
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,640
about about myAir a lot.

93
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,120
But first, I want to really understand

94
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,080
the industry better

95
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,560
and some of the earned

96
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,080
secrets and insights that you've gained

97
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,200
over working at those various companies.

98
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,880
So, what can you teach me about

99
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,320
the food space in general,

100
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,600
whether it's the innovation side of it,

101
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,160
the marketing, the product side of it,

102
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,680
what insights have you gained

103
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,880
over the years dealing with food

104
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,320
and consumers as a product?

105
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,600
Maybe it's funny, you know,

106
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,520
but my main insights about food came

107
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,760
when I worked for pharmaceuticals.

108
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,120
You know, I was VP

109
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,600
at Teva Pharmaceuticals,

110
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,880
the leading generic pharma company.

111
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:07,240
And I understood that opioids and drugs

112
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,240
are not a good solution.

113
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,000
And that we are what we eat.

114
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,960
And good health start with what we eat.

115
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,240
And, you know,

116
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,800
if another part of the world

117
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,760
already understood that plants

118
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,040
could be the best medicine

119
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,960
and you know that our body

120
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,640
is a very intelligent creature,

121
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,160
and if you give it the right fuel,

122
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,560
it can heal itself.

123
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,120
You just need to be cautious

124
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,880
to understand your body

125
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,440
and to give it to the right fuel,

126
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,040
which is your food.

127
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,760
So, what we understood

128
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,640
that plants could be that right fuel

129
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,560
because super plants

130
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,080
are the first technology of the world.

131
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,240
Right.

132
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,080
I've been hearing about

133
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,520
these super foods for forever.

134
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,800
Yeah.

135
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
So, you know, you say forever

136
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,800
because maybe you are very educated.

137
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,160
But most of us, you know,

138
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,680
started with eating this junk food.

139
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,440
This is what I grew on.

140
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,680
And now, we can understand

141
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,080
that we can be more precise

142
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,240
and learn from plants

143
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,200
and how they deal with nature.

144
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,480
And the very, you know,

145
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,960
new trend in super plants is adaptogens.

146
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,840
Adaptogens come from the word

147
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,560
to adapt to your environment.

148
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,720
Adaptogens are the way that plants

149
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,080
adapt to their environment

150
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,640
and heal themselves.

151
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,240
And the most famous of the adaptogen

152
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,920
in the world is caffeine.

153
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,880
We drink it,

154
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,360
we think that it's a nice flavor,

155
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,120
but that's not enough.

156
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Caffeine actually relates

157
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,400
to our cognitive system

158
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,109
and affect our focus

159
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,600
or [--].

160
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,640
So, what we are doing at myAir,

161
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,880
we actually crafted

162
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,120
and researched formulations

163
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,400
of different adaptogens

164
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,040
coming from super plants,

165
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,840
and each different formulations

166
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,360
created different effect on our mood.

167
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,760
Okay. So, tell me a little bit

168
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,200
about this industry of super foods,

169
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,040
foods for moods.

170
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,120
What's been happening

171
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,400
over the past years

172
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,840
in terms of consumer behavior?

173
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,480
Because you mentioned

174
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,920
that you had different generations

175
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,960
of food tech and innovation

176
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
ranging from, you know,

177
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,160
the simple foods that we're used

178
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,200
to eating to then getting

179
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,520
a little bit more personalized

180
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,440
with super foods, and now basically

181
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,600
people can know what foods

182
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:27,960
are good for them.

183
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,760
And we have companies like DayTwo

184
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,200
23andMe that are giving us insights

185
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,800
into really our genealogy

186
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,640
and what foods will have,

187
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,440
what effect will have on our body.

188
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,120
So, what's happening today in 2020

189
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,240
and what are some interesting

190
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,480
trends that you're observing?

191
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,920
So, actually what is happening

192
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,560
is people understand

193
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,360
that they shouldn't take drugs,

194
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,960
they should take less drugs.

195
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,040
And you know,

196
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,000
transmit themselves to healthier food

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,320
and functional foods

198
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,480
that is precise to their own body.

199
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,240
So, that category of food actually

200
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,600
is leading on a huge trend,

201
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,560
which is big data.

202
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,440
You know that professor

203
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Yuval Noah Harari is talking a lot about

204
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,880
the three generations

205
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,560
of consumer decision making.

206
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:18,760
Right.

207
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,480
They start with religious.

208
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,160
So, it was easy for us

209
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,440
to take a decision by the priest

210
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,680
or the rabbi that helped us to choose

211
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,960
and then moved forward to capitalism.

212
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,280
So, we thought that we have,

213
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,640
you know, all the options.

214
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,120
And now, all of our consumer,

215
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,720
decision making processes

216
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,880
are based on big data.

217
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,440
So, AI actually leverages

218
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,920
our decision making.

219
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,280
And if we think that we choose

220
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,920
a book, for example,

221
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,800
it's not so true because maybe

222
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,440
the book is choosing us.

223
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,340
When I read the Audible,

224
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:58,320
Audible read me as well.

225
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,120
So, if you compare that

226
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,760
to the food industry,

227
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,160
this is actually what is going

228
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,640
to happen to us.

229
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:06,800
And five years from now,

230
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,520
each one of us

231
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,240
is going to get a food

232
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,120
that is relevant

233
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,160
on his personal biomarkers.

234
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,040
It might be DNA,

235
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,120
it might be physiological data

236
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,520
that you derived from smartwatches,

237
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,800
wearables, like sleeping quality,

238
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,720
HRV, a body battery, etc.

239
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,120
And of course,

240
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,480
the psychological parameters.

241
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:28,720
Right.

242
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,440
So, actually we are combining

243
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,080
all that data,

244
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
we leverage AI in order

245
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,080
to take decision about everything.

246
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,600
And this is the future of food tech

247
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,080
and this is what we are doing at myAir.

248
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:45,840
But we are actually focusing

249
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,000
on a very, very big unmet need.

250
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,800
And if you will look around you,

251
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,640
you will see that

252
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,160
most of your colleagues,

253
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,080
friends, family probably

254
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,800
are suffering from chronic stress.

255
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,160
You know that before covid,

256
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,040
the World Health Organization declared

257
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,880
that stress is the chronic silent killer.

258
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,040
It's the epidemic for our era.

259
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,840
And then arrived the very small

260
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,520
other epidemic.

261
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,960
But stress levels just went

262
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,000
you know, higher and higher

263
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,640
since the covid.

264
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,720
And what we understood

265
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,760
is that we can empower the millions

266
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,200
to control their stress

267
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,040
through personalized nutrition.

268
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,920
Because stress, chronic stress

269
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,800
is something that you should manage

270
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,000
as if it was your dietary routine

271
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,920
or your sports routine.

272
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,400
So, actually, we leverage the next trend

273
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,120
of the food industry

274
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,760
with a very big unmet need.

275
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,680
That makes a lot of sense.

276
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,920
So, tell me a little bit about myAir.

277
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,320
What is some of the thought process

278
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,880
that went into that?

279
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,520
Because before myAir,

280
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,200
you were acting as

281
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,520
vice president and executive

282
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,280
at all these fantastic companies

283
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,360
and you decided to venture out

284
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,520
into a company of your own.

285
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,040
And I love understanding

286
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,640
that shift in mindset

287
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,440
and that journey that you take

288
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,480
on you with you.

289
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:03,880
Yeah.

290
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,320
So, my journey is, as you mentioned,

291
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,200
started from being a corporate girl,

292
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,640
for the last 20 years.

293
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,760
I had a stressful career

294
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,840
as VP marketing at Teva,

295
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,920
the leading generic pharma company.

296
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,720
And as CEO

297
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,480
at this next division at Nestlé,

298
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
the leading food corporate.

299
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,960
And as a business leader

300
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,240
and executive manager, and mother

301
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,400
and a caregiver to my parents,

302
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,440
stress has become

303
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,840
a massive burden in my life.

304
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,120
And I tried to manage my stress

305
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,400
through meditation and mindfulness.

306
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,560
But I failed to maintain

307
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,560
a stress less routine.

308
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,520
Until I understood that

309
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,600
there is one thing

310
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,360
that we all love to do

311
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,320
which is eating, of course.

312
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
You know that it's really difficult

313
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,800
to change behavior when

314
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,560
there is a friction.

315
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,240
When you try to do something

316
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,880
that is not part of your routine.

317
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,040
But when you combine it into

318
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,680
the regular stuff that you love to do,

319
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,560
like eating, it becomes easy.

320
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,320
So, myAir is actually

321
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,440
a smart food company.

322
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,720
We develop a functional plant-based

323
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,760
nutrition bars,

324
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,880
I can show you in a second,

325
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,040
made with super plants based on research.

326
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,160
Everything is patented at research based

327
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,760
and they're proven to reduce stress.

328
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,680
We leverage big data to tailor them

329
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,800
to the consumer stress effect.

330
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,480
So, imagine that once a month

331
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,800
you get these box into your doorstep

332
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,160
and in the box you're going

333
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,120
to find nutrition bar

334
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,640
that are relevant to your own stress.

335
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,720
So, let's say, you know,

336
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,280
stress has many faces,

337
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,520
and each one of us

338
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520
deserve his own solution.

339
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,040
So, we conducted a research

340
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,520
with Garmin Health

341
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,880
and we understood that each one of us

342
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,800
has two main stress effects

343
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,640
that are relevant to him.

344
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,200
So, for me, stress affects me

345
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,560
mainly at night, on my sleep

346
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,320
and in the morning, on my focus.

347
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,640
So, those are the bars

348
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,920
that I need to eat.

349
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,160
Okay, and how do you identify that?

350
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,000
How do you identify the things

351
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,240
that you want to improve on?

352
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,560
Yes.

353
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,480
So, we developed an algorithm

354
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,960
with Professor Daniela Kaufer

355
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,040
from Berkeley.

356
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,920
She's the dean of the biological faculty

357
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,520
and a stress researcher

358
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,680
within the last 20 years.

359
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,320
And we actually leverage big data

360
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,880
from physiological markers

361
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,640
and psychological markers.

362
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,600
Because stress is a condition

363
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
of mind and body.

364
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,720
So, the physiological data, we take

365
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,800
from a smartwatch.

366
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,840
Do you have a smartwatch

367
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,480
like Garmin or Apple Watch,

368
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,160
something like that?

369
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:45,760
Yeah.

370
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,920
It's all because

371
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,240
you came from California. Right?

372
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,200
Early adaptor, [--] leader,

373
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,520
you're my target audience.

374
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,320
Amazing. I'm ready to buy.

375
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,880
Yeah.

376
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,680
So you can go to our website,

377
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,760
go to myAir.ai,

378
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,560
do the cognitive assessment.

379
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,320
That's the beginning of the journey.

380
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,440
It's only the first assessment.

381
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,480
And then, we create this engagement

382
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,720
relationship that you keep answer,

383
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,960
we take the data

384
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,000
and we understand what kind of bars

385
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
makes you need to eat

386
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,720
and how you can control your stress.

387
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,360
Very, very cool.

388
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,560
So, walk me through some of the process

389
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,440
that I would go as a consumer

390
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,320
if I were to want to take part in myAir.

391
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,000
And I would then love to transition also

392
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,880
the conversation to some of the future,

393
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,040
of what the future holds for us

394
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,160
in food tech in general as well.

395
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,200
Sure.

396
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,680
So, the journey is very easy.

397
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,760
I can assume, you know,

398
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
that like most of us,

399
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,640
75% of the population

400
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,880
suffer from chronic stress.

401
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,360
And you go to a website, myAir.ai,

402
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,120
and you fill up

403
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,360
this very short questionnaire,

404
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,520
the test yourself part.

405
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,280
And after a few minutes

406
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,800
you're going to discover

407
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,520
what are the main two stress effects

408
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,720
that are relevant to you.

409
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,640
Everything is research based,

410
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,880
patented and based on a profound

411
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,440
clinical research that we conducted

412
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,120
with the Garmin Health.

413
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,160
So, you are going

414
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,120
to discover your solution,

415
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,720
your personal solution,

416
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,040
and then you are going to order

417
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,440
and then you are going to get the box

418
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,120
and your personal table of usage.

419
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,520
We have consumers

420
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,040
that need to eat one bar

421
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,400
in the morning for focus

422
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,840
or energy or calm

423
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,640
and one bar in the evening

424
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,120
for mass attention

425
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,480
or forgetting to sleep

426
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,960
or to have a deeper quality of sleep.

427
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,560
We have users

428
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,200
that didn't need just only one bar

429
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,320
or one bar per two days,

430
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,600
or something else.

431
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,040
So, everybody gain his own

432
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,440
personal solution.

433
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,000
And then we invite you

434
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,680
to connect your wearable

435
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,400
in order to gain more insights

436
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,360
that are based on physiological data.

437
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,280
And the algorithm

438
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,120
is actually working all the time

439
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,240
and you know, learning never ends.

440
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,480
So, the big data is actually

441
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,240
keep moving on

442
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,040
and keep helping us to get

443
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,520
the best personal box of super plants

444
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,400
for each consumer.

445
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,600
That's so interesting.

446
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,440
So, where is this whole thing headed?

447
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,240
So, it makes perfect sense to me

448
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
that things are becoming

449
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,080
more personalized

450
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,840
and we want both take ownership

451
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,720
over what we put into our body.

452
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,360
I just met a fascinating startup

453
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
called Feto,

454
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,720
which does personalized capsules

455
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,680
for shaker's for workout's

456
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,120
for whatever we want.

457
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,760
So, there's a lot of really interesting,

458
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,440
very really great.

459
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,320
But there's a lot of interesting

460
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,360
and innovative things happening

461
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,000
in the space.

462
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,520
And I'm really curious about

463
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,400
what is our food experience

464
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,200
is going to be like,

465
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,120
let's say in five, ten years?

466
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,280
What are some

467
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,520
of the big, big shifts

468
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,320
that you are anticipating

469
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,360
in this industry?

470
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,840
So first, the biggest chip,

471
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,360
I think it's going to be

472
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,720
in the area of replacing our drugs

473
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,360
with super plants.

474
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,040
As long as we will move and keep,

475
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,200
you know, growing the trend

476
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,600
of natural ingredients,

477
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,400
and this is a huge trend, you know,

478
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,320
moving to plants, to vegan

479
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,120
and move into clean label,

480
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,480
understand that all these

481
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
artificial ingredients are really,

482
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,000
really bad for our body.

483
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,400
And this is going just

484
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,560
to be bigger and bigger

485
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,320
and even covid helped us

486
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,120
you know, to push that.

487
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,680
Another big trend in food

488
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,800
industry is e-commerce.

489
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,000
You know that in covid,

490
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,240
we actually gained

491
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,880
a decades in weeks of progress.

492
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,880
And e-commerce and food boomed

493
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,960
from 11% to 30% in six months

494
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,480
which is unheard of.

495
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,400
So, the e-commerce is going

496
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,840
to help us all in the food industry

497
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,640
to gain more personalization.

498
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,240
Because all the big food corporates

499
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,240
are looking for the best way

500
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,800
to meet their consumer

501
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,280
and to understand him better.

502
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,360
You know that the future of health

503
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,080
is digital health, is prevention.

504
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,000
Each one of us is going to be connected

505
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,280
to his doctor with a device to, you know,

506
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,840
send his own private file to the doctor

507
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,200
and gain his own personal solution

508
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,960
on time, on demand

509
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,080
and even with preventing.

510
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,440
So, the food is going

511
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,480
to help us through that

512
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,560
and going to be a more precise

513
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,440
and based on your own

514
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,920
body physiological needs.

515
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,320
And so, as I mentioned before,

516
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,400
the third generation of food industry

517
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,880
is functional and personalized

518
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,920
and plant based.

519
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,000
That's very, very cool.

520
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,360
And I have to say that

521
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,720
I completely agree with what's going on.

522
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,600
I think that what's interesting for me

523
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,080
is I do a lot of research on food tech

524
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,360
and I'm very conscious as well as

525
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,480
what I put into my body.

526
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,600
And I think that a lot of my generation

527
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,280
is also similar in that regard.

528
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,200
And obviously we know

529
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,480
the integration of all the tools

530
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,680
that we're early adaptors of,

531
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,560
it makes perfect sense,

532
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,600
we're also early adopters

533
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,160
of this mindset.

534
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,000
And that's besides the fact

535
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,760
that I think that supermarkets,

536
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,040
especially in Tel Aviv and Palo Alto

537
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,320
are filled with super foods

538
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,040
and personalized things for us.

539
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,320
What are the side effects of all of this?

540
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,080
So, obviously,

541
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,320
myAirs side effect hopefully

542
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,840
is a population that

543
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,400
has less chronic stress.

544
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,520
What are other side effects

545
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,320
that we can presume regarding

546
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,640
the innovation in food?

547
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,720
So, myAir is, you know,

548
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,880
focusing on one huge unmet need,

549
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,240
which is chronic stress,

550
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,040
but food can help us

551
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,200
you know, with dealing

552
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,400
with other mood conditions as well.

553
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,520
And food for mood industry

554
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,240
is something that is now,

555
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,960
you know, only starting.

556
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,760
But all the big corporates

557
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,960
are investigating that area deeply.

558
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,560
And I'm sure that in the future,

559
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,480
we are going to choose good food

560
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,720
and plants as a source

561
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,520
of cognitive effects as well,

562
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,560
because our body has the right receptors.

563
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,800
And if we just open them

564
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,480
and touch them so

565
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,040
our body can react to that

566
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,400
and our cognitive system

567
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
is built for that.

568
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,320
So, we are what we eat

569
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,160
is not just a sentence,

570
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,720
it's truly strong belief.

571
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,600
And I understand as I, you know,

572
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,800
how all the big corporates work

573
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,280
that the wave is going to be huge.

574
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,920
I completely agree.

575
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,840
I think that's inspiring.

576
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,400
And Rachel, I want to thank you

577
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,960
for being so kind with your time,

578
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,280
so generous with your time.

579
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,040
It's been very, very insightful.

580
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,880
And I just love

581
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,680
what you're doing with myAir,

582
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,520
and I'm honestly

583
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,240
going to have to try that

584
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,440
for myself because

585
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,240
I just love food tech

586
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,600
and I love the integration

587
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,760
of artificial intelligence,

588
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,480
the technology with our everyday things,

589
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,520
especially things that we put

590
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,760
into our body.

591
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,680
So, I'm very excited

592
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,000
to check it out for myself.

593
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,720
But before we leave,

594
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,360
I have to ask you

595
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,880
the most important question,

596
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,000
which is three words

597
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,560
that you would use to describe yourself.

598
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,200
Well, I think it would be

599
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,600
with passion to dare and to win.

600
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,880
Wow. I love that. Rachel,

601
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,880
thank you very, very much.

602
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,300
Stay safe. Stay healthy

603
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:34,013
Thank you so much.

604
00:20:34,014 --> 00:20:35,120
It's been great meeting you.

605
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,560
And I hope,

606
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,640
you know, we will have the chance

607
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,320
to meet face to face as well.

608
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,520
Definitely. Take care.
