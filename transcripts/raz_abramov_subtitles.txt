Raz Abramov, thank you for being on my show. How are you? Thank you for having me. All is well. How are you? Everything is great. It's so late in Tel Aviv right now. Thank you for being here at this hour. I'm really excited for this talk and to chat with you and to learn about your journey both as an entrepreneur, as a VP R&D. Transitioning to product from VP R&D. And talking about everything. From helping run the company from bootstrap, to moving between different customers around the world. I can't wait to learn as much as I can over those 20 minutes. But Raz, I'd like to start off. Tell me a little bit about your journey. How did you get started? How how did you end up VP R&D at EverCompliant? It's a long journey indeed. But that's only the beginning. I've been a technologist from a young age. Ever since I could pick up a keyboard, [--] I started [--] How early was that would you say? Seventh grade. I think my dad, who's also a developer, he's still until today, pushed C++ book to my life, and said, "Start reading." So, I started reading. So, basically, while a lot of people were reading Harry Potter at 12. You were reading a book on C++? Yes. Something like that. Okay. Good. Just clarifying for everybody. Then, throughout high school my [--] and then I joined the army to 8200 units and Technology Center where I did military service, also did some training. I guided the course that I've been to, the junior soldier. That was a lot of fun. And after five years, I got on the list and then I started freelancing, actually. I want to taste a little bit of everything. So, that everything from software, to chip designs, to mobile apps. I helped a lot of people making their dreams come true. And then I decided that I want to follow my own. How long did you do freelancing for? Roughly three years. So, when we started EverCompliant, my company, I still bootstrapped. So, I still did a little bit of freelancing at first. But then transitioned to full time once we started to head off. Now, I do want to delay on this comment that you made. You said something about helping others make their dreams come true. Right? Elaborate a little bit about that. Because it's an interesting way of phrasing what you were doing as a freelancer and you chose to do it for three years to perhaps gain perspective. But what does that mean to you that you are helping others achieve their dreams or making them come true? So, as I was working in fact finding clients is less of probably when you have the community that we have in the Israeli military. So, I worked towards a lot of entrepreneurs that have the different challenges in different areas. Where they have the vision, they have the idea, the great concept of how they want to see their company. And they need some guidance in the technology area. So, just to someone that can tie it all together and show them that  forward. And that was a great pleasure for me to work with them on these areas on. Really, to see the spark in their eyes when they see the finished product. So, just to clarify. you would come in and help these entrepreneurs, founders, etc, or other technology teams, and you would come and help them with your skill sets. Come in, help them with the product, bring it to fruition, bring their vision on the computer. And then, they would enjoy this product. And then something within you said, "Okay. I want to do this myself." "I want to create my own company." Exactly. Okay. So, we're there now. Tell me a little bit about EverCompliant. So, we started in the garage. Two coders and the CEO, just looking for the [--] for customers. We actually pivoted a few times, polishing the idea. We started the bootstrap completely [--] until we saw [--] And I think that the first major milestone was around a funding which we raised from Cardinal Ventures, [--] And that happened after we landed our first regular client [--] [--] Yeah. So, we've been working with them on the products for about a year. And as we raised a round A, we saw that their problem is really an international problem. Global problem. And they had a problem with merchants passing the illegal activity through them without them knowing. That they were working with the company they thought was selling shoes out of [--]. And it turns out that they have been hiding illegal activity. I won't mention the specifics because, Yeah. [--] Right. But, yes. So, we develop technology to help them see that. Help them gain visibility into those areas, mainly in the e-commerce space. And we saw that this problem was global. So, we took our luggage and went to Mexico and said, "Hi. We notice a problem." "And can we help you solve it?" They said, "You arrived at the right time." "This is the problem." "We've known about it." "We're working on the definite solution." So, hold on, hold on, Raz. I want to paint the picture. You have two coders and a CEO out of the garage, bootstrapped, just raised your series A. And you're knocking on the door of MasterCard and you're saying, "Hey, we have this technology." "Is this relevant?" And they're saying, "Yes, it's very relevant." Right? Actually, that meeting is a funny story. We arrived at the meeting, after meeting with a potential partner in Atlanta. Now, we plan to have the flight in the previous day to arrive to New York [--]. But it was snowed in and the airports are closed. It weren't the first time that the snow hit Atlanta. And so,we drove all night in shifts until we arrived at the meeting on time. And the rest is history. Wow. Wow. Okay. So, I mean, that literally is like an entrepreneur movie. You get in the car and driving all night. Okay. So, you begin, I guess, working with MasterCard and helping. So, just dumb it down for me. What is EverCompliant? And how do you actually help those that are doing online transactions? Because I'm very familiar with the complexity of compliance. Obviously, I'm coming also from the insurance space now at Hippo. So, I understand compliance a little bit, but not nearly enough to really understand what you're doing. So, our specialty is to find connections between online activities It's usually around commerce. What we found is that, today, it's very easy to set up an online merchant. Almost easy. It takes about 10 minutes. An access to your favorite website building your platform. And then you have a website ready to go and you can start transacting. And that acceleration of e-merchants popping up, has create a smoke screen where you can hide illegal activity without people detecting it. And that's what we're doing at EverCompliant. We mop out all of the online activity. Online commerce activity. And by extracting data from each and every website, about what the website is doing. And who are the owners of the websites. Who registered domain, or the company behind it. And other details. We're able to connect these activities together. So, when we approached our customers that were banks and service providers anyone who wants it, and merchants, we can get their promotion portfolio and connect to the seemingly legitimate merchants [--]. So, give me a little bit of background about this market. Because it sounds like this is a problem that is especially relevant today. Maybe less so, 15 or 20 years ago when building online presence and gaining credibility wasn't as democratized as it is today. Why aren't there so many others working the space? Or, maybe there are. I mean, because it sounds like this is one of the most relevant things in today's age, especially as practically all of our shopping is done online. And covid is just accelerating e-commerce, I'm sure, like crazy. So, there are competitors in that area. I have the utmost respect for them. And we love a good competition. And when we approach the market, we saw it was a while ago, we saw that problem was ramping up [--]. I can see the numbers of merchants rising up year after year. And there was no solution in sight. And then we decided to build our platform. And yeah, as the area grew, our market grew, and the company grew as well. So, how do you then, as one of the founders, and as VP R&D and soon we'll talk about the transition to product. How do you think, or how much weight do you give to the congestion of the space? And how your other competitors are approaching this? Because, if there are other competitors that are direct competitors, I'm guessing right now as you're in the hypergrowth stage and you're trying to gain credibility and market share, what are some of the key considerations that you're bringing to the table? So, as an Israeli company, we started from technology. Of course. But our competitors actually started from different business aspects. So, either from business analysts, we built an online database and [--] to customers. Or different varieties of that area. And when we approached with the technology the solution really make things much better for our customers. So, in that aspect, we always try to maintain that technological edge and think up the next thing where the market is going to. So, we can stay ahead of the curve. And in that aspect, when you're building companies, then you start a path to heavily invested in R&D all throughout your lifecycle. And I'm sure Hippo still dedicating a lot of resources. Doubling down. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So, it's something that's important to [--], especially when there's always pressure to put more in marketing and sales. Just being at the bottom line. [--] our numbers. But at the end of the day, you've built up technology. [--] I love it. Okay. So, again, going back to three guys in a garage. Two coders and a CEO, you're approaching MasterCard and all of a sudden you have this huge client. And this is after, you're also, your main experience as a freelance engineer is to help small teams bring their products to fruition. How is this transition of going from, some Israeli customers for EverCompliant, all of a sudden, seeing MasterCard, and working with one of the biggest online transaction companies? Give me a little bit of taste as to what that's like. So, when you're working with MasterCard, you have a lot of, they present you the market list. They sent us over to different global companies and that we tested our product real time with them. And they saw the benefits and they became our first global customers. And that process is really it brings the company to a different level of maturity. Because when you look for productivity, it's very nice, very clean. The back up position is very crisp and that's what we're working on. But once you bring on enterprise customers and you start [--]. There are a ton of other operational compliance, legal demands to meet. Very long the procurement processes. Things that the company has to adjust. And, so, we had some money in the bank, so we were able to round that up. But something that you have to take into account when you start a B2B enterprise. Were there any things that were completely mind blowing or very surprising in this process as you're maturing the company very quickly? Because I'm guessing, from the moment that you're signing with MasterCard, pretty much it's like go time. You have to reach that maturity very quickly, right? Yeah. It's been a meeting after meeting. And long requirements are showing up on our doorstep. And we have to ramp up our new team very quickly. We have to ramp up legal compliance. We have to do standardization efforts. And again, as you're building your technology, you're still a young company, it's a huge a task to take. Of course. And so, talk to me a little bit about this transition that you're doing now. So, VP R&D for EverCompliant. You started as a founder and VP R&D and you continued until now. And you mentioned that you're making this very interesting transition to running the product. Yeah. So, that all started about two years ago. So, as a younger founder, you're doing pretty much a little bit of everything. Right. So, I thought that there was a place for me to take really take the product and the company forward. And to lead in that area. And that it's also been very interesting for me personally. And it seemed like something that the company will benefit from. So then, we started looking for [--] took us about a year, to find someone who is suitable and [--] obviously, with the company. And last year, last August actually, I started running the part. And I have to say that being technology and founder and products is, there had a lot of overlap between them. Especially in a young company. When you build a technology, you always have to have a product mindset to understand what's replicable and what's not. What's to build and not to build. When to say, "no". It's difficult for enterprise to say "no". But it's something that you have to be always take into account and [--] and to ramp up, first of all, myself and product. Because I haven't had any formal training before. [--] and [--] has been amazing for me. But how do you go to an existing company that you're a part of, and all of a sudden assume the role of running the product without prior knowledge of running products for companies? Because essentially, you're taking on the responsibility of now building something that needs to scale and needs to service the market. And I'm guessing that one of the main motivations now of EverCompliant is to start gaining market share and gaining market dominance. And a lot of it is on your shoulders now because you're running the product. So, how do you quickly catch up to that skill set? So, for me, it's been a few parts. First of all, I'm fortunate to know a lot of very talented people who are product managers. And I've met with them, learned from them, and asked a lot of questions. [--] And I learned a lot that way. And I also had a chance to work alongside top managers, amazing top managers, I worked with a lot of them. And last but not least, I've also dedicate lot of time to read almost every book in existence on product to really formalize the training. And to ramp up my knowledge around that. And I'm still learning a lot every day. So, it's never ending story. I'm sure. I'm sure. What are the biggest challenges that you and your co-founders have faced over the past few years in your EverCompliant journey? It could be the bootstrapping part, the fundraising part, or the hiring part. What were some of the things that you faced that were like, wow, this is a huge challenge and I'm really excited to tackle it. So, there are a lot of different challenges over there, I have to say. But I think the main challenge we had is going from local to global. So, from Israel to the United States, to everywhere else in the world. And different geographies have different regulations and mindsets at different procurement policy. And to learn to take all that in to really build a company around this. It's been an amazing journey. I love it. And any advice that you would give to other young entrepreneurs who are perhaps just starting their journey? Maybe they're finishing the same course that you and I did. And now they're transitioning out to the real world and they're considering starting out a company from their garage. But as you both of us know, it's a weird experience going out from the IDF's bubble to the real world and doing different technology, obviously. So, first of all, I'll say what I always say to my employees when they ask that one day they want to open the startup why they should do it or not, I always say, "Do it." And if you do that, I will help you anywhere anyway I can. I think it's an amazing experience. So, anybody watching this, if anybody needs advice, Raz Abramov is here. Absolutely. My door and Facebook are always open. I love it. Okay. So now, comes the most important question. Why did you do it? So, I understand why you transitioned from freelance and you said, Okay. I'm helping others achieve their dreams. What I'm trying to understand also is why you chose to go in and start a company? Because you didn't choose to go and work at a corporate. Or experience running engineering at other companies and then products. You said, "I'm ready to go and start my own business." And that's an interesting transition to me. So, talk to me a little bit about why you chose to do it and what really gets you up every morning. So, actually, it was a decision I made when I was very young. I was about 17, I think. I saw the great stories of the startups of the day. And I wanted my own story to be written. So, that's my main driver here. And that's still driving me today. So, I want to write that story. I want to write that big story that young people look up to and say, "I want to be that person one day." And how do you do that then? So, does that mean that EverCompliant needs to reach substantial heights? Does it mean that you need to be seen as somebody who is like a mentor to others? How do you get to the point where you're writing that story? So, first of all, there's no "I" in company. So, EverCompliant it's like a baby for me. I've seen it from an infancy. And I want to see it reach as high as possible. And as long as I'm breathing, I will always strive to move that company forward. And yeah, I think that's it. I love it Raz, I want to thank you again for your generosity in your time. It sounds like an incredible journey. I'm going to wait for the movie about the meeting with MasterCard and driving all night. But before we leave, I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. Whatever it takes. Whatever it takes. I love it. Raz, toda raba. Thank you very very much. And I look forward to sharing this with the world. Thank you.
