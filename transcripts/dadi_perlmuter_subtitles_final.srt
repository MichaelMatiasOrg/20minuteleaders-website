1
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,200
Dadi Perlmutter, thank you so much

2
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
for joining me on my show.

3
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,040
How are you?

4
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,440
I'm good. Very well.

5
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,080
Working extremely efficiently from home.

6
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,840
Working ... you don't have to walk

7
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
from meeting to meeting.

8
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,000
You must be saving some time.

9
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,500
Yeah.

10
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,600
I love it.

11
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,400
I'm walking more.

12
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,720
That's what I hear a lot,

13
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,440
but now, I'm actually I'm curious

14
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,640
to see what will happen

15
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,760
As we move forward,

16
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,080
the productivity increases,

17
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,840
but whether we'll get

18
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
some fatigue from this,

19
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,720
I think it'll be

20
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,560
a very interesting question.

21
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,120
But, Dadi, I'm not gonna waste time

22
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,240
talking about what's happening now

23
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,000
because I have the honor and pleasure

24
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,400
of speaking to you now.

25
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,680
You've spent over 30 years

26
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
at Intel Corporation.

27
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,440
Your last activity there

28
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,960
was acting as executive vice president

29
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,800
and chief product officer

30
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,200
of Intel Corporation.

31
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,600
Dadi, just for my ...

32
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,040
how many people are at Intel globally

33
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,240
around or at least

34
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,920
when you were there?

35
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,320
About 100,000.

36
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,720
About 100,000 people.

37
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,640
As executive vice president and CPO,

38
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,160
I believe I saw somewhere

39
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,880
that about 30,000 people

40
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,040
were under your command?

41
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
35,000.

42
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,320
35,000.

43
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,120
Dadi, I'm gonna spend 20 minutes

44
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,200
on a single question,

45
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,440
but actually I have many more questions.

46
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,040
But what is it like

47
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,160
running 35,000 people

48
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,600
as executive vice president of Intel?

49
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,400
It's very difficult.

50
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,090
And I think ...

51
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,680
That's why I can work

52
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,280
from remote much easier,

53
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,440
because you find out that you have

54
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,640
Andy Grove said something,

55
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,840
when you manage something

56
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,400
so complex, so far,

57
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,160
you have to influence people

58
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,080
because you cannot talk to each person

59
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,080
and change his mind.

60
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,800
So, you have to be

61
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,520
much more into influencing.

62
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
So example, be very precise and

63
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,480
very concise about what you say

64
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,360
and how you say.

65
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,040
I ... my Israeli officer

66
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,720
that you have to be in the lines

67
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,800
every once in a while,

68
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,200
to talk to people in the line,

69
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,640
to make sure that you know exactly

70
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,720
who they are

71
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
because the problem is

72
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,520
that you ... the information

73
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,320
from your people,

74
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,120
which is very important.

75
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,960
So I think that

76
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,640
it's such a rare opportunity

77
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,360
to speak to somebody

78
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,800
who's managed 35,000 people.

79
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,280
I often ask entrepreneurs and founders

80
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,480
about leadership and about

81
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,920
what is it like running a team

82
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,600
of 12, 13 people

83
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,160
as you go through the trenches

84
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,480
of a startup.

85
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,760
What are the difficulties

86
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,480
and the challenges

87
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,320
of running 35,000 people?

88
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,040
I mean, how do you lead

89
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,680
a group of 35,000 people?

90
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,760
Do they know you?

91
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,080
Do they know who Dadi is?

92
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,440
Are you just this guy in the background

93
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,200
making the decisions?

94
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,000
How does it work?

95
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,640
Well I manage also five, six people teams,

96
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,720
so I know the difference.

97
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,840
It's a huge difference.

98
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,120
When you manage five, six, 10 people

99
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,200
usually you're all together,

100
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,960
and if you're a startup,

101
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,080
you mostly know

102
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,840
many of the people for years

103
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,120
and you're good friends with them.

104
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,480
Right.

105
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,400
And it's very different

106
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,920
when you run 35,000

107
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,000
across probably four continents

108
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,440
or something like that.

109
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,000
I learned something from,

110
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,280
someone asked Mahatma Gandhi,

111
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,160
"How do you lead for 400 million people?"

112
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,720
At that time, there had been only

113
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,240
400 million Indians at the time.

114
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,520
He said,

115
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,440
"I'm not leading them;

116
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,200
I'm seeing where the people are running

117
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,400
and I'm just running in front of them."

118
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,360
You come to realize that

119
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,800
most of the people, other than people

120
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,320
that work really closely with you,

121
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,560
and with many of the people

122
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,840
I've been working for dozens of years,

123
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,640
the people have the persona of you.

124
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,440
They have the impression of who you are.

125
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,640
Which may not be,

126
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,320
or probably, not exactly who you are.

127
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,240
Or, as I said, people have many personas.

128
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,800
It's not that you are schizophrenic

129
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,400
or something like that,

130
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,840
but you have many persona because,

131
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,920
my kids see a different Dadi

132
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,400
than my wife is,

133
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,720
and where my friends are,

134
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,520
and my employees are.

135
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,760
But at the end of the day,

136
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,720
you're the same person.

137
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,480
My leadership style

138
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,280
that I'm open and direct.

139
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,200
People know what I mean when I say.

140
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,920
They don't have to second guess me.

141
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,440
Makes it easier for them

142
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,280
to understand what I'm talking about.

143
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,000
That's my ... you don't trick them.

144
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,920
And you show by example.

145
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,720
Is it possible to be open and direct

146
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,120
with 30,000 people?

147
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,640
Yes, because if you admit

148
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,880
when you make mistakes,

149
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,560
and if you do it every day,

150
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,400
it's a problem.

151
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,350
Right.

152
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,670
... don't want to be led by an idiot

153
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,720
that change his mind every day.

154
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,040
But, every once in a while,

155
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,160
you make a bad move

156
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,520
and human beings make bad decisions.

157
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,760
I believe that a good leader

158
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,720
is not one that does not make a mistake

159
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,540
because all people are.

160
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,040
is ... admit openly about the mistake,

161
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,600
learn from the mistakes,

162
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,680
and direct a new course of action

163
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,040
because, not because you are idiots,

164
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,400
you don't know what to do.

165
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,760
Maybe you are idiots,

166
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,280
but I'm also part of the team of idiots

167
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,160
and this is why I made a mistake.

168
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,480
This is what happened.

169
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,760
This is what I'm going to do next.

170
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,440
And I have a big lecture about this one.

171
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,680
But my greatest achievement,

172
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,240
Intel is a ...

173
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,000
was based on a big failure

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,280
that we learned from the mistake

175
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,920
and applied
You know the whole Intel notebook,

176
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,960
the Centrino program,

177
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,080
was based on a failed program

178
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,440
that was codenamed Timna.

179
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,240
And it was a big failure,

180
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,240
and a huge success.

181
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,760
And today it's a core core part

182
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,120
and part of all of the-

183
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,560
Now, it is the foundation

184
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,280
of what became the core.

185
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,320
But as a matter of fact, at that time,

186
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,760
only 50% of people use notebooks.

187
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,560
Today, 90% of people buy notebooks

188
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,600
when they use a personal computer.

189
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,120
I was having a wonderful conversation

190
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,640
the other day with Gil Frostig

191
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,280
who you probably know from Intel as well.

192
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,160
And he's a very good friend here

193
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,960
from J-Ventures.

194
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,600
And we were talking about his endeavors

195
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,480
with Wi-Fi chips and how that also

196
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,080
came from not a mistake,

197
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,600
but some consequence

198
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,760
that he did not expect.

199
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,520
But, Dadi, I want to take you then

200
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,840
back to you're at the Technion,

201
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,200
you're studying electrical engineering,

202
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,400
you're joining Intel.

203
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,520
Eventually, you come to speak about

204
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,240
how one of the great things

205
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,280
about this cooperation

206
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,320
between Intel and the Technion is that

207
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,080
while they're both situated

208
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,800
in very close proximity,

209
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,240
but the best and the brightest

210
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,800
from the Technion

211
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,360
often go to work at Intel.

212
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,240
And you're creating something

213
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
very special there

214
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,520
within the startup nation.

215
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,720
Take me back to those times.

216
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,800
You join Intel.

217
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,200
Do you have an aspiration

218
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,160
to go and spend over 30 years

219
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,600
at this great corporation

220
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,720
and rise the ladder of success

221
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,520
to be one of the executives?

222
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,040
Is that intentional?

223
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,280
No. I came to Intel as a compromise

224
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,640
because I really wanted to be an academic.

225
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,680
I wanted to be a professor.

226
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,480
So, you settled

227
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,080
for going on a career path for executive.

228
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,360
I like that.

229
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,400
I was very very young.

230
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,880
I basically was married

231
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,360
when I studied in the Technion.

232
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,480
My eldest son was already born.

233
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,440
And when talking to my wife I said

234
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,400
I want to go to do my masters

235
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,080
and then PhD. She said,

236
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,520
"Well, you know we are

237
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,800
in a bad financial situation.

238
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,920
We have to get stable a little bit."

239
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,960
And we decided

240
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,560
that I'll go to work at Intel

241
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,360
and continue my studies

242
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,560
as an external student.

243
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,520
Wow.

244
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,440
And so maybe two, three years,

245
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,120
we get stabilized.

246
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,120
I never finished my masters degree.

247
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,200
And I spent 34 years at Intel.

248
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,440
But every three, four years

249
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,200
was a completely different journey.

250
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,400
And that doesn't stop you

251
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,880
from now teaching and inspiring

252
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,320
thousands on the Coursera course

253
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,760
that I came across.

254
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,040
So, I think that

255
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,800
the masters degree will wait.

256
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,440
Dadi, I want to make sure

257
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,400
we have enough time for this.

258
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,560
I want to do a transition now

259
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,800
to the time after Intel.

260
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,720
And one of the things that is very evident

261
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,840
when you look at your background

262
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,720
and the things that you're doing

263
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,000
is that you're very passionate about

264
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,560
social entrepreneurship,

265
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,080
social innovation, both as the

266
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,840
chairman of the board of Mishelanu,

267
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,160
but also chairman of the board

268
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,280
of Israel Innovation Authority

269
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,200
and I'm probably missing

270
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,000
a bunch of others

271
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,680
that I didn't mention here.

272
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,840
What is this transition

273
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,240
from an executive vice president at Intel

274
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,680
to being the chairman of the board

275
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,680
of these organizations?

276
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,560
And what does that even mean

277
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,200
being the chairman of the board?

278
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,920
For me, it is very simple

279
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,160
because it's the same thing.

280
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,160
Basically, the one thing that eventually

281
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,240
got me to say I think that

282
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,480
because my dream was to make things

283
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,560
that change the world.

284
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,600
That's my dream.

285
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,760
Since I was a child.

286
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,360
I thought I'll do it as an academic,

287
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,560
then as an engineer,

288
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,160
eventually as an executive

289
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,400
in a big company.

290
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,720
But there are other things to do

291
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,120
other than computing.

292
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,080
And basically computing and technology

293
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,280
could be used for bad things

294
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,960
in many cases,

295
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,560
but also for good things.

296
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,280
And I'm focusing on Israel.

297
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,480
But most of these problems

298
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,960
are worldwide issues,

299
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,480
and basically my wife and I decided

300
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,840
that we'd devote a big portion of our time

301
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,960
and all of our philanthropic investment

302
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,880
into social entrepreneurship,

303
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,040
predominantly in education,

304
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,640
closing social gaps,

305
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,560
giving opportunities, and combining

306
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,160
or making communities closer.

307
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,900
So, one of the I'm a chairman also

308
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,680
of a nonprofit that deals with

309
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,840
bringing the Arab community in Israel

310
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,920
into Israeli high tech.

311
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,600
So, it's all the same.

312
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,120
People are different,

313
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,080
but it's all about working with people

314
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,560
with motivation to do great things.

315
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,960
So, inspire me a little

316
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,680
with some of the things

317
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,520
that you're deeply passionate about.

318
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,120
Some things that you know

319
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,680
I, as a young entrepreneur

320
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,160
now here in Palo Alto or from Tel Aviv,

321
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,320
that I might not be exposed to

322
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
on a day to day basis.

323
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,240
These are issues

324
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,520
that are very close to my heart as well

325
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,400
because all the way through high school

326
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:05,920
and the military,

327
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,800
I was also very active and very passionate at

328
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,360
bringing together various communities.

329
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,400
But I'd love to get your take,

330
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,320
because now you're getting an exposure

331
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,560
at this from an executive level

332
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,600
as you're overseeing

333
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,760
a lot of these organizations

334
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,240
that are doing a

335
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,600
really amazing impact.

336
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,680
So, what are some of the things

337
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,720
that I, as young entrepreneur,

338
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,360
can take with me and understand better

339
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,600
about my society?

340
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,480
And what is my potential role as a leader

341
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,360
as I go into the high tech industry,

342
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,400
hopefully make a positive impact,

343
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,880
but I also have a social responsibility

344
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,120
to bridge together communities

345
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,880
and not be a bystander and let the same

346
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,440
circle of effect take place.

347
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,080
Unfortunately, the world is using

348
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,600
... possibilities for you

349
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,320
if you want to do things.

350
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:54,760
We picked education because education,

351
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,640
at the end of the day, is the

352
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,280
you can argue masters degree, yes, no,

353
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,200
but this is,

354
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,880
for most of the kids in the world,

355
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,000
this is just.

356
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,440
Every child have a huge intelligence.

357
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,320
In the US, they have the saying that

358
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,000
we could very much

359
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
anticipate your success

360
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,600
in school and in life

361
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,240
based on the zip code.

362
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,320
And the zip code is not, is an indicator

363
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,280
of how wealthy your parents are.

364
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,320
It has nothing to do with you,

365
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,920
your intelligence, your abilities.

366
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,800
So, giving opportunities.

367
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,280
If you want to change the world,

368
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,400
one of the ways, which takes longer,

369
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
is to give opportunities

370
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,040
for kids in school.

371
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,040
And it's amazing.

372
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,160
One of the organizations

373
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,120
that my wife and I are doing,

374
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,960
they take schools

375
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,280
in the wrong zip codes.

376
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,240
And it's amazing how smart

377
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,160
the team of people with relatively

378
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,240
small amount of money

379
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,160
are able to make changes

380
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,720
from a 20% success

381
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,560
in academic successes

382
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,440
into 80 and even 90% in three, four years.

383
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,360
What is the changing factor?

384
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,240
What changes from 20 to 80%?

385
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,120
It's a complex way,

386
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,320
but it's a very much

387
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,140
a very systematic view

388
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,840
of people ... education

389
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,760
combined with people

390
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,640
that come from the high tech community.

391
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,720
They go, it sounds like an ...

392
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,400
My wife is an educator.

393
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,360
She was a principal

394
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,680
of a special ed school.

395
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,720
They go in with the right people,

396
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,200
good pedagogy, they do a few things.

397
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,400
First, the schoolmaster is the king.

398
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,080
They are not doing

399
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,000
the plans for him or her.

400
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,320
The ownership is the schoolmaster.

401
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,240
It's a big difference.

402
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,400
In Israel, especially,

403
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,200
the minister of education

404
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,120
tells the schoolmaster

405
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,460
what he needs to do, or she.

406
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,480
... is she,

407
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,360
so I'll use she from now on.

408
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,240
They bring in a set of volunteers.

409
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,640
They come from high tech business,

410
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,040
army, 81 and 82.

411
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,760
They make miracles in helping kids

412
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,840
to go study the highest level of math

413
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,520
and go to what ... examinations.

414
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,920
And they are same age, give or take.

415
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,800
So, it's not the 60 plus years old

416
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,880
tell them what to do.

417
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,600
[crosstalk]

418
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,080
[crosstalk]

419
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,680
It's a big influence.

420
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,600
We bring what we call a mentor

421
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,720
for the schoolmaster.

422
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,480
Someone from,

423
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,960
we have an Army lieutenant general

424
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,400
is one of those. He sits there

425
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,280
and the schoolmaster calls him

426
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,120
and they get help.

427
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,800
And the pedagogic team comes in

428
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,160
and do a deep analysis of the school.

429
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,880
Not just the pedagogic

430
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,560
and academic successes,

431
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,240
social situation,

432
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,800
the level of the teachers,

433
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,240
the teamwork between the schoolmaster

434
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,160
and the teachers,

435
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,840
the situation at home.

436
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,080
Many of these kids go at home

437
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,640
that have one parent

438
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,640
and not two, social economic issues.

439
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,040
And they eventually based on this data,

440
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,040
and they have huge amount of information,

441
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,120
and the schoolmaster always say,

442
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,280
"I have never seen such a deep analysis

443
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,880
to understand the school

444
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,800
that I'm running for five, six years."

445
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,180
And it's classical,

446
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,800
basic engineer, call it that way.

447
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,680
And then they support the schoolmaster.

448
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,800
We give them some money,

449
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,240
not a huge amount.

450
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,400
But you don't come as a consultant.

451
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:37,760
You come and you say,

452
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,960
"I'll help you implement the plan.

453
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,560
You create"

454
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,640
So Dadi, while this is remarkable

455
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,560
and inspiring, I see a dissonance.

456
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,600
On one hand,

457
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,960
you're overseeing an operation

458
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,280
of 35,000 people.

459
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,800
Chief product officer of intel.

460
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,800
You're running billions of dollars, right,

461
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,920
in terms of both talent

462
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,560
but also in terms of products.

463
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,280
So, you're used

464
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,160
to making decisions at scale, right?

465
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,360
Like high level.

466
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,280
Like, how do we go about the world.

467
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,320
Now you're talking to me.

468
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,720
How do we go into a single school

469
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,640
and influence kids

470
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,120
that you can count on a piece of paper.

471
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,680
And so, is that intentional?

472
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,600
Because you could be spending

473
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,320
your time right now

474
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,840
sitting on the boards of unicorns

475
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,600
that are dealing with billions of people.

476
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,320
And you're choosing

477
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,680
to spend your time and effort

478
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,640
on this mentorship activity

479
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,200
for specific people.

480
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,760
Well, the truth of the matter

481
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,080
One, I do also,

482
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,760
I'm a chairman of two startups

483
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,720
and I'm also investors in a few others.

484
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,160
So, my day is full. My main job-

485
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,200
But Dadi, I just want to make sure.

486
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,960
But when you go

487
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,400
and you look Dadi up online, what exudes

488
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,600
is your philanthropic activities.

489
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,560
It's not the investments

490
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,520
and it's not the board.

491
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,960
It's the volunteering work

492
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,920
that you are doing.

493
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,080
I agree. And I'll tell you what.

494
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,080
My main job in this nonprofit,

495
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,120
my wife do this,

496
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,000
she ... with 10 schools

497
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,680
so she's a big manager too.

498
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,240
A big challenge and one of the things

499
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,000
that I work very closely

500
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,400
with the CEO of this nonprofit,

501
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,440
an impressive lady,

502
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,600
is about scale.

503
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,040
Because we are now dealing,

504
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,240
when my wife and I joined, we dealt with

505
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,640
about seven or eight schools.

506
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,360
We're now dealing with 40.

507
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,960
All of the big,

508
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,760
looks insurmountable right now

509
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,000
is how to influence

510
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,360
the minister of education

511
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,360
to change her mind,

512
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,520
because at the end of the day, in Israel,

513
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,480
there are about

514
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,360
800 to a 1000 schools like this.

515
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,240
So, 40 schools it's still a drop.

516
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,320
But there's an old saying in Hebrew that

517
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,920
the one who saves the life of one person

518
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,800
is if he changes the life

519
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,440
of save the life of the whole world.

520
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,240
So, every kid matters.

521
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,760
So, it's not a small deal.

522
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,640
It's more important

523
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,000
than billions of dollars.

524
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,760
I always ... to

525
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,000
my wife the third job

526
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,800
in saving kid's life

527
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,440
literally in her school
- Amazing

528
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,680
is bigger job

529
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,080
than my billions of dollars.

530
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,120
But you have to say

531
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,720
that everything that I do,

532
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,440
with every non-profit that I work with,

533
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,920
is about scale, not just the one person.

534
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,880
Nevertheless, the one person

535
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,640
is still extremely important.

536
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,480
Dadi, so much inspiration here.

537
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,560
Before we leave,

538
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,040
you've been an integral part

539
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,960
of the startup nation

540
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,560
and the foundation of the startup nation

541
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,600
from its early days.

542
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,880
What is the startup nation?

543
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,960
What is this miracle

544
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,000
of this tech innovation

545
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,320
in Israel beyond Intel?

546
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:47,880
You've seen it.

547
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,120
You've lived it.

548
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,920
Why is Israel a big tech hub?

549
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,200
Well, I'll tell you.

550
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,840
First, Israel is not a startup nation.

551
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,400
There is a nation within Israel

552
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,360
called startup nation,

553
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,400
which is about 9% of the people

554
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,440
in the country.

555
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,960
My job, talking just about education,

556
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,560
is hopefully to turn the whole Israel

557
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,360
into a startup nation.

558
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,480
Not meaning that everybody works

559
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,680
on a startup and inventing technology,

560
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,400
but the world is becoming more

561
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,640
based on technology,

562
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,560
and people who are not technology literate

563
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
are not going to be able

564
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,760
to succeed in this world.

565
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,960
And the corona crisis

566
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,280
even exemplified that even further.

567
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,280
20 years ago, I was interviewed

568
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,880
in New Delhi.

569
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,920
They wanted to turn India

570
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,480
into the IT nation.

571
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,040
And they talk about Intel of course,

572
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,600
and all that.

573
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,480
And his last question was

574
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,600
the same question you asked;

575
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,200
what do we in India need to do?

576
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,640
And I said

577
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,200
What you are doing good in Israel.

578
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,460
I said,

579
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,560
"That means you don't understand

580
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,800
Israeli culture."

581
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,440
If you ask me what's bad in Israel,

582
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,600
I'll give you a 15 minute lecture

583
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,880
without even thinking.
 - 15 hours

584
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,440
If you want to ask me what's good,

585
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,240
give me five minutes to think.

586
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,320
It's about the impatience,

587
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,280
the wanting to do things better,

588
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,000
wanting to do things differently,

589
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,200
not being confined to the box.

590
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,520
Right.

591
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,600
And so, I said it's very short,

592
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,280
but it's very, it's very easily

593
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,840
the camaraderie on one hand

594
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,360
and the personal success

595
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,040
on the other hand.

596
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,920
So I've seen culture that

597
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,680
go either on camaraderie,

598
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,600
or the personal inspiration.

599
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,760
And in Israel, it's something

600
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,320
which is quite unique.

601
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,800
And it's very difficult to explain

602
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,840
because how can you be driving

603
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,360
your own personal success?

604
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,280
Is it on the expense of the camaraderie?

605
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,680
Never will be at the expense of the team

606
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,720
in especially successful.

607
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,640
That's one of the reasons for success.

608
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,200
I love it.

609
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,520
When I always think about this question,

610
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,440
first, I obviously go back

611
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,520
to my own military service

612
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,400
and I can't help but remember

613
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,200
all the times where

614
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,960
I was leading a team of engineers.

615
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,120
My commander would come in and say,

616
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,280
"Michael, here is the task.

617
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,520
We need this software

618
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,320
to be done next week."

619
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:05,760
And I'm saying,

620
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,560
"But we need three times the people

621
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,200
in order to get this done."

622
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,880
And he's like,

623
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,480
"No. You'll figure out a way. I trust you.

624
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,560
Come back next week."

625
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,480
And obviously you figure out a way,

626
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,640
but I also think back to Ben Gurion

627
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,960
and I don't know if it's a myth

628
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,720
or if it's a real story

629
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,280
that we ran out of rice.

630
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,200
And so he said,

631
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,960
"Figure out a way."

632
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,960
And that's how he came

633
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,840
to make ptitim,

634
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,200
my favorite food of all time.

635
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,040
I had a boss, he was Chinese.

636
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,000
A very harsh person.

637
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,800
And I came to ask him about

638
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,160
... me better information

639
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,200
about competition at the time was digital

640
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,480
in the 90s.

641
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,040
And he said,

642
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,360
"What you asking me?

643
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,600
You're Israelis.

644
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,760
I'm sure you or one of you guys know

645
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,280
someone in Boston

646
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,640
that works with digital and you know the information.

647
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,240
Come back next month

648
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,440
and tell me what you do."

649
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,080
I love it. I love it.

650
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,120
Dadi, thank you so much for your time.

652
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
I know you're so busy

653
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,600
so I really really want to thank you.

654
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,760
Before we leave, I need three words

655
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,360
that you would use to describe yourself.

656
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,800
I'll tell you what my father used to say

657
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,640
when I was a kid

658
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,640
and he asked me to walk in our garden

659
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,760
to do gardening, which I hated. He said,

660
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,200
"You are an ambitious, lazy person.

661
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,080
You are thinking

662
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,400
how to do things easier."

663
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,360
I love it. I love it.

664
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,520
Dadi, thank you very very much

665
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,520
and stay safe and stay healthy.

666
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,600
And really, thank you for your time.

667
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,280
Really appreciate it.
- Thank you Michael.

668
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,800
Have fun. Bye.
