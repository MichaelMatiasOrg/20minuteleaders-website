1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,120
Data in the past used to be, you know,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,800
BI reporting that you would look at

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,480
once a month

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,760
or once a quarter, whatnot.

5
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,080
And, you know, if it's broken,

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,680
if the numbers are wrong, no worries,

7
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,040
you take a few extra days

8
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,200
and you go and fix that.

9
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:14,760
Right.

10
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,560
And that's changing rapidly today.

11
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,120
Like modern tech companies

12
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,040
kind of live off of their dashboards.

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,480
Hundreds, thousands of people

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,920
look at the data every day

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,240
to make every single decision.

16
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,680
And then increasingly,

17
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,000
people are using machine learning models

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,920
to automate decisions

19
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,480
and to do things fully automatically

20
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,403
based on data.

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,976
Lior Gavish,

22
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:05,480
welcome to 20 Minute Leaders.

23
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,840
How are you?

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm good.

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,480
Excited to be here today.

26
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,960
I'm honored to have you here.

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,000
Lior, we have way too many things

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,640
I want to talk about.

29
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,480
I'm just going to dive in

30
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,600
to give a little bit about your bio,

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,120
and then I'll ask some of the fun

32
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,600
and interesting questions.

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,240
You know, Tel Aviv university

34
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,840
for bachelors and masters at Stanford.

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,445
MBA at the GSB.

36
00:01:25,446 --> 00:01:28,120
A co-founder of Sookasa,

37
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,320
which first of all,

38
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,600
it's a beautiful name.

39
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,560
And I have to learn more

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,040
about what you did there,

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,240
sold to Barracuda after being backed

42
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,680
by Accel and Andreessen Horowitz

43
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,600
and First Round Capital.

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,560
Which I have to ask,

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,000
how the hell you made that happen?

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,320
Then senior vice president

47
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,680
of email protection at Barracuda.

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,760
And now, the co-founder

49
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,640
of another startup, Monte Carlo.

50
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,573
Lior, this show

51
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:51,600
is for young entrepreneurs.

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,680
I'm a young, hungry,

53
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,200
scrappy entrepreneur.

54
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,800
And I know that there's so much

55
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,600
that I can learn from you.

56
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,560
So, I really want to make use

57
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,760
of these 20 minutes.

58
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,480
So, first of all,

59
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,720
thank you for being here.

60
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,320
And second of all,

61
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,400
tell me a little bit about you.

62
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,640
Are you an engineer?

63
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,840
An Entrepreneur?

64
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,320
What are you?

65
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,480
It's a great question.

66
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,920
And I've been going back and forth

67
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,400
about that for a long time now.

68
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,880
I'm definitely an engineer by training.

69
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,880
And also I think that

70
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,680
that's where my heart is at.

71
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,080
But I did find myself

72
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,360
spending a lot of time

73
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,080
on non engineering stuff

74
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,880
because I've spent a lot of time

75
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,200
in early stage startups.

76
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,520
And when you do that,

77
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,800
you kind of get to do

78
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,600
a lot of different things

79
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,160
across the board from,

80
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,520
you know, from building teams

81
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,960
that to go to market

82
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,120
and also product engineering.

83
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,920
Right.

84
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,440
So, I've definitely spent a lot of time

85
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,120
doing other things as well.

86
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,560
But I'm still hoping that one day

87
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,640
I'll get to get back

88
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
to writing code all day long.

89
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,880
I'm definitely passionate about that.

90
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,960
You know, I have to say that

91
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,920
that is one of the things

92
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,840
that excites me most

93
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,520
in talking to people like you

94
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:01,920
on this show.

95
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,240
Because you have somebody here who,

96
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,320
you know, is an engineer

97
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,240
but had such a unique experience

98
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,120
both of the GSB,

99
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,520
then creating a company

100
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,200
that was sold to Barracuda.

101
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:14,760
Being a varied executive manager

102
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,000
at Barracuda.

103
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Now another again,

104
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,520
an entrepreneur.

105
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,800
But saying that after all this,

106
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,040
you still wish you can go back

107
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,000
to writing code because

108
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,800
you are truly passionate

109
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,880
about technology.

110
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,280
And I just love that because

111
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,040
I think it's that passion and curious,

112
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,000
which leads people like you

113
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,960
to these huge milestones.

114
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,800
Tell me a little bit about

115
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,880
the journey that you took

116
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
and some of the decisions

117
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,760
that you've made along that journey.

118
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,040
Because it's not the typical

119
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,640
Israeli journey to go to the GSB

120
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,440
and then everything else.

121
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,680
But tell me a little bit about

122
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,880
what you have done there.

123
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,400
Yeah. You know,

124
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,840
it's been a long journey

125
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
with a lot of turns.

126
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,560
But I started my career

127
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,000
as an engineer, right.

128
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,280
Like I worked for

129
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,720
a couple of startups back in Israel,

130
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,120
you know, in my 20s.

131
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,200
And at some point there,

132
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,000
I felt I wanted a new adventure.

133
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,200
It's kind of broadened my horizons

134
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,920
and learn things beyond engineering.

135
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,000
Maybe try a different place as well.

136
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,480
So, that's kind of what inspired me

137
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,280
to come to Stanford.

138
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,480
And Stanford was kind of

139
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,960
a great experience

140
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,200
and a great opportunity for me.

141
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,560
Because I think it's kind of

142
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,640
it brings together

143
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,560
like general business training

144
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,440
and leadership training

145
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,400
and all that good stuff,

146
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,760
along with an environment

147
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,080
that's very tech oriented

148
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,320
and startup oriented.

149
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,960
And there's,

150
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,760
it's really the community there

151
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,880
is very vibrant

152
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,160
and very focused around

153
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,200
entrepreneurship in tech.

154
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,760
So, it was a great

155
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,480
kind of combination for me.

156
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,880
So, I spent two years there.

157
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,960
I dabbled with thinking,

158
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,560
I might do non-tech stuff like,

159
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,800
I don't know, consulting

160
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,200
or semi tech stuff like VC.

161
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,640
But ended up deciding

162
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,120
that I want to do the thing

163
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,800
that I love best,

164
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,520
which is startups and engineering.

165
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,440
So, I ended up partnering up

166
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,160
with my co-founder back then.

167
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,200
He was a PhD at Stanford

168
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,400
in electrical engineering.

169
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,560
We partnered together to start

170
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,720
a startup company, Sookasa,

171
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,280
in the cybersecurity space.

172
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,000
So, that's what I did right after school,

173
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,560
right after the GSB.

174
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,440
Wait, Lior.

175
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,880
You are at Stanford,

176
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,720
you're at the GSB.

177
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,480
You're thinking about consulting

178
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,840
or going to VC or say, no, no,

179
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,320
I'm going to be an entrepreneur.

180
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,680
And you have a friend,

181
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,080
PhD electrical engineering at Stanford.

182
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,280
What was the moment

183
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,560
where you decided

184
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,280
to start this together?

185
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,320
Were you always talking

186
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,960
about creating a company together?

187
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,840
Or did you just say,

188
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,920
okay, let's try something?

189
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,200
Or did you have an idea first

190
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,640
and then join forces?

191
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,560
What actually happened there?

192
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,480
Yeah. I know, I think

193
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,600
I made the decision independently

194
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
that I want to start a company.

195
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,480
It was just too exciting to pass up.

196
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,880
And I actually,

197
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,920
I worked with a handful of people

198
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,440
back then including classmates from GSB.

199
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,760
And, you know,

200
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,560
you go around between different projects

201
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,000
and different ideas

202
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,240
and there were in completely

203
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,000
different spaces.

204
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,480
Like one of us was in e-commerce.

205
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,080
And another one

206
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,240
was actually also in e-commerce.

207
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,600
And then the third one

208
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,040
was what I ended up doing

209
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,480
with my co-founder back then,

210
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,440
whose name is Asaf

211
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,080
and just ended up being feeling right.

212
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,240
Right?

213
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,360
It was the right team.

214
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,520
It was the right space.

215
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,080
It was an exciting opportunity

216
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,320
in a space that seemed

217
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,480
to have a lot of dynamics in it,

218
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,400
a lot of growth.

219
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,440
So, soon it ended up being kind of

220
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,480
the right opportunity for me

221
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,240
amongst several that I explored.

222
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:09,760
And that's something

223
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:11,800
I would tell anyone thinking

224
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,720
of starting a company.

225
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,720
You know,

226
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,880
it's worthwhile looking through

227
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,520
several different teams,

228
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,240
if you can,

229
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,320
and several different

230
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,720
spaces and ideas

231
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,036
and see where things stick.

232
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:26,519
Like where do you get your passion

233
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,330
and where you

234
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:29,200
see customers getting excited.

235
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,520
Where are things moving

236
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,920
and changing quickly.

237
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,320
And yeah, it worked for me, so.

238
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,880
So, you actually ended up spending

239
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,760
just about as much time in Barracuda

240
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,400
as you did in Sookasa, right?

241
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,760
Because you spend about four years

242
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,360
in each of them.

243
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,840
A little bit less in Barracuda

244
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,000
but you had the unique role

245
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,520
of being senior vice president

246
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,240
of engineering with email protection.

247
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,120
And, you know,

248
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,040
as a cybersecurity enthusiast myself,

249
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,760
I'd love to hear a little bit about

250
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,400
what would you do there.

251
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,080
And what is it about email protection

252
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,840
that it was so relevant

253
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,640
to what you were doing?

254
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,920
So, when we joined Barracuda,

255
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,560
Barracuda acquired Sookasa,

256
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,440
and when we joined Barracuda

257
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,040
we were fortunate to work

258
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,200
with some really,

259
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,560
really great leaders there

260
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,240
and learn a ton.

261
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,080
And one of the things

262
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,160
that happened was

263
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,840
that we got a carte blanche,

264
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,520
like go and do something exciting

265
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,080
and can be whatever you want.

266
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,480
Right?

267
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,880
And I think,

268
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,800
after three or four years

269
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,720
of doing Sookasa,

270
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,760
we felt that we were kind of

271
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,720
exhausting, if you will,

272
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,360
the market around

273
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,600
what we were building at Sookasa.

274
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,840
And we're thinking like,

275
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,280
what are some adjacent fields,

276
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
where some areas where

277
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,360
we can take this technology

278
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,880
and really build something even bigger

279
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,200
and even more exciting.

280
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,400
And it so happened

281
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,640
that those times

282
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,160
we're at times of great need

283
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,000
in the email protection space.

284
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,840
So, it was a time when

285
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,240
various types of highly

286
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,280
personalized phishing attacks

287
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,440
and account takeover attacks

288
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,800
and other forms of email fraud

289
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,240
were kind of growing really fast.

290
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,560
And we realized that the industry

291
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,920
was lagging behind

292
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,960
in terms of being able to address it.

293
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,600
And like every time

294
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,800
we spoke to customers,

295
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,800
they were inundated

296
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,760
with these things

297
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,440
and it started to get into

298
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,160
kind of material economic damage

299
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,520
happening through email text.

300
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
And so, we had this

301
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,920
like very unique approach,

302
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
technical approach

303
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,320
to solving this problem

304
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,520
that didn't exist back then

305
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,600
and kind of line pretty well

306
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,920
with the things that we did at Sookasa.

307
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,440
So, we ended up building and launching

308
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,440
a product at the Barracuda.

309
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,120
The product was,

310
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,040
it was the fastest growing product

311
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,840
for Barracuda ever.

312
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,480
Unbelievable.

313
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,160
And kind of ended up leading the market.

314
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,440
And we got into the leader wave

315
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,640
of Forrester and what not,

316
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,360
so, for the first time

317
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,320
in the company's history.

318
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,640
So, it was really exciting

319
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
and it was a very gratifying experience.

320
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,840
I learned a ton

321
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,320
both about the technology

322
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,400
and the market that we were operating in,

323
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,880
which is email protection.

324
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,680
And I also learned a ton about,

325
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,040
you know, building teams

326
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,760
and companies and learning

327
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,720
from senior leaders.

328
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:47,640
That's, I had to admit like

329
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,542
throughout my career,

330
00:10:48,543 --> 00:10:50,720
before I mostly worked in

331
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,280
smaller startups

332
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,680
and I do learn a ton.

333
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,000
Right?

334
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,640
Like you learn a ton by doing.

335
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,280
And like figuring stuff out

336
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,280
and making your own mistakes.

337
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,600
And it was the first time

338
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,760
that I was working for people

339
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,640
that were far ahead of me

340
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,720
in their careers.

341
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,800
And I had a great opportunity to learn

342
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,880
and really see how they look at things

343
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,000
and how they do business

344
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,160
and how they lead teams

345
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,320
and all that good stuff.

346
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,200
So, I stayed for a long time

347
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,680
and really, really enjoyed it.

348
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,720
Even when I left,

349
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,840
I was still very excited

350
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,880
about what I was doing.

351
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,880
And I would probably be happy

352
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,440
to stay there as well.

353
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,560
But I ended up leaving

354
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,000
for an even more exciting opportunities.

355
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,320
What I did today, it's Monte Carlo.

356
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,000
I love that.

357
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,440
One key difference

358
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,640
from being the entrepreneur in the room,

359
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,120
you know, as you're scaling your startup

360
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,600
and then all of a sudden joining

361
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,360
and being senior vice president

362
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,600
at a much bigger company,

363
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,400
you know, building teams

364
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,640
that I'm sure that building a product

365
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,360
within a big company

366
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,120
is very, very different

367
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,800
than building a product within a startup.

368
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,920
What is one or two key differences

369
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,680
that you've observed

370
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,920
from these experiences?

371
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,840
Yeah. I know it's a huge difference.

372
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,440
I think one difference

373
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,240
which has been thoroughly discussed

374
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,560
in a lot of books

375
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,800
is definitely the kind of some form

376
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,480
of the innovator's dilemma, right?

377
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,440
Where the company

378
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,520
has a certain momentum

379
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,000
and has teams that

380
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,200
have been spending years

381
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,840
and sometimes decades

382
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,200
building stuff.

383
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,000
And that stuff brings money.

384
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,440
Right?

385
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,760
And it's selling well

386
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,080
and it's working great.

387
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,920
And like, how do you come

388
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,720
and tell them that,

389
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,480
you know, you might do it

390
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,200
in a nice way,

391
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,240
but how do you come and tell them

392
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,640
that that's legacy

393
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,600
and that they really need to be investing

394
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,840
in this new exciting thing

395
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,440
that's making no money right now,

396
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,480
but will be big one day.

397
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:49,680
And I think that

398
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,520
that's definitely a challenge

399
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,360
in a larger organization

400
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,960
that where a lot of people

401
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,640
have a lot of momentum going

402
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,440
in a certain direction.

403
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,240
So, that's definitely something

404
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,320
that I, you know,

405
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,760
you can read about in books,

406
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,360
but until you kind of go through it

407
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,240
and experience it yourself,

408
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,880
it's hard to fully understand.

409
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,360
So, that's one thing I learned.

410
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,720
The second maybe

411
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,720
it was definitely

412
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,720
a much larger team in Barracuda.

413
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,640
So, I learned that a lot of,

414
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,560
that really

415
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,800
it's also true for smaller teams,

416
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,920
but like culture wins. Right?

417
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,760
Every time, right?

418
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,280
Yeah.

419
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:43,400
Like my job, I could no longer

420
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,000
even fully understand everything

421
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,960
that we did. Right?

422
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,200
Like, there's so many things going on.

423
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,760
I certainly didn't have any opportunity

424
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,480
to do things myself.

425
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,600
But like the main way by which

426
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,520
I could impact the organization

427
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,280
was to hire the right people

428
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,520
and to put together a, you know,

429
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,200
a framework or an environment

430
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,920
that would make them successful.

431
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,280
So, in the culture.

432
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,040
So, that was huge as well, so.

433
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,680
Very, very cool.

434
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,000
Lior, we don't have much time.

435
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,360
But the most exciting opportunity now,

436
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,429
Monte Carlo.

437
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,789
At first, when I saw

438
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,200
that you work in Monte Carlo is,

439
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:26,700
I'm like okay,

440
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:27,840
"Is he building the poker chips

441
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,600
that I enjoy playing

442
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,240
with my friends on Friday nights?"

443
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,200
I'm assuming that it's not

444
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,760
that I know that it's all about data.

445
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,520
So, tell me a little bit

446
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,760
about Monte Carlo

447
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,000
and the decision to leave

448
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,400
the incredible role

449
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,200
of senior vice president in Barracuda

450
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,360
to again be a young entrepreneur.

451
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,440
Yeah. I know poker chips

452
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,960
is definitely one of the ideas

453
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,000
we were considering at the time.

454
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,320
We decided to go for data.

455
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,800
I don't know.

456
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
Time will tell whether

457
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,160
that was the right decision.

458
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,680
We'll see.

459
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,320
Yeah, I don't know.

460
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,720
It's early.

461
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,920
But what we do,

462
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,400
so, we're definitely in the data space.

463
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,720
Our customers, our data teams

464
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,160
so, we have data engineers

465
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,320
and data analysts

466
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,440
and sometimes data scientists.

467
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,920
And we help them

468
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,080
with a buzzword called observability.

469
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,800
So, it's the idea of being able

470
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,400
to make systems reliable.

471
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,760
And I'll try to explain that.

472
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,800
So, you know,

473
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,720
maybe the way to think about it is,

474
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,000
especially if you've been in engineering

475
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,440
is, you know, 20 years ago,

476
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,000
if you even had a website

477
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,800
and it was broken and went down,

478
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,040
nobody cared. Right?

479
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,760
Like you might call someone in marketing

480
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,960
to take a look at it the next day.

481
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,600
Today, any sort of business

482
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,040
is strongly reliant on digital

483
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,000
and on online applications

484
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,760
and websites.

485
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,360
And if something gets broken,

486
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,360
you know, someone's going

487
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,600
to wake up at night to fix it.

488
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,680
And in fact, multiple people

489
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,960
and it'll be a CEO level issue. Right?

490
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,760
And we think the same thing

491
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,080
is happening to data. Right?

492
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,400
Data in the past used to be, you know,

493
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,040
BI reporting that you would look at

494
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
once a month or once a quarter whatnot.

495
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,360
And, you know, if it's broken,

496
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,960
if the numbers are wrong, no worries.

497
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,320
You take a few extra days

498
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,480
and you go and fix that.

499
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,040
Right.

500
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,840
And that's changing rapidly today.

501
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,400
Like modern tech companies

502
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,280
kind of live off of their dashboards.

503
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,080
Hundreds, thousands of people look

504
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,480
at the data every day to make

505
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,520
every single decision.

506
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,920
And then increasingly,

507
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,440
people are using

508
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,280
machine learning models

509
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,160
to automate decisions

510
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,920
and to do things

511
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,760
fully automatically based on data.

512
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,520
And data is also

513
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,640
becoming the product

514
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,080
for a lot of companies. Right?

515
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,320
They might be serving data

516
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,280
to their customers as their service.

517
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,880
And so, the reliability of that data,

518
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,440
the accuracy of that data,

519
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,600
the correctness of that data

520
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,440
is becoming important.

521
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,240
And it's no longer something

522
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,400
that you're you know,

523
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,600
you're calling someone

524
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,640
and they might take care of it

525
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,400
a few days later.

526
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,800
It's something that you need

527
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,080
to take care of in real time.

528
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,680
You need to make sure

529
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,440
your data is reliable.

530
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,320
And in the same way

531
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,720
that there's a lot of methodology

532
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
in software engineering,

533
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,680
a lot of tooling,

534
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,240
you know, tools like Datadog

535
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,880
and New Relic and AppDynamics

536
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,560
to manage, you know,

537
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,240
the reliability of applications.

538
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,560
We're helping teams with managing

539
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,880
the reliability of their data products

540
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,520
of reporting, of models, of analytics.

541
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
So, that's what we're working on today.

542
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,840
I love that.

543
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,520
Lior, it's such an exciting journey.

544
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,160
What are some of the biggest insights

545
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,200
that you're taking with you

546
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,160
from Sookasa in the early stages

547
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,520
now to Monte Carlo?

548
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,600
You know, the things that

549
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,040
if you hadn't done Sookasa,

550
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,080
you probably wouldn't know

551
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,560
or you wouldn't believe

552
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,560
if others would tell you.

553
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,520
Yes.

554
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,360
It's a good question.

555
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,040
I hope I learned a few things.

556
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,240
The main why I think,

557
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,560
I think at Sookasa

558
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,520
one of, you know,

559
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,400
looking back in hindsight is 2020,

560
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,040
we were building essentially

561
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,920
a security layer for Dropbox.

562
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,080
Dropbox back then was taking hold

563
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,400
and it was becoming very popular

564
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,560
and we felt that businesses

565
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,520
will need ways to secure Dropbox

566
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
and make it more appropriate

567
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,320
for confidential

568
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,120
or sensitive information.

569
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,160
So, that's what we were working on.

570
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,560
It was an exciting opportunity.

571
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,960
We had kind of early success

572
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,000
and we pretty much dominated that market.

573
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,720
We were,

574
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,560
Dropbox is our number one partner.

575
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,160
And if you needed security for Dropbox,

576
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,800
Sookasa was your go to solution.

577
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,280
And it was all very exciting.

578
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,480
However,

579
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,480
I think that we were so focused on that

580
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,920
specific niche in the market

581
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,720
that we overlooked

582
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,360
even larger opportunities

583
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,520
that existed back then.

584
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,360
A category that was later

585
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,600
that later became CASB,

586
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,520
was happening back in the time.

587
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,000
And we could have gone in that category.

588
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,080
It was a natural extension

589
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,000
of what we were doing.

590
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,960
And we didn't.

591
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,080
We were super focused,

592
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,320
laser focused on optimizing

593
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
for our niche.

594
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,600
And that ended up

595
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,560
being a mistake, right?

596
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,200
Like the CASB market ended up

597
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,080
being much larger

598
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,640
and much more interesting

599
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,440
over the long term.

600
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,360
And I think what I learned from that was,

601
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,000
you know, you have to be

602
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,040
laser focused on what you're doing.

603
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,160
Make your customers happy.

604
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,400
And make one customer happy,

605
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,840
then make 10 customers happy, etc.

606
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,360
And at the same time,

607
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,240
you want to be

608
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,320
attentive to what's going on

609
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,480
and be willing to change course

610
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,320
and expand the definition

611
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,240
of what you're doing

612
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,760
and see where things are going

613
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,560
and where the

614
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,320
kind of broader market is shifting.

615
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,440
And I think that's one

616
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,840
of the biggest things I took away.

617
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,640
Like at the end of the day,

618
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,360
if you want to build

619
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,520
a really large company

620
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,200
and that's our goal with Monte Carlo,

621
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,480
we're here to, you know,

622
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,800
to build a unicorn or a decacorn

623
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,080
or whatever it is,

624
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,920
an industry changing company.

625
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,080
And to do that,

626
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,600
you really need to see things

627
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,760
in a broad way.

628
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,400
It's not enough to build like a feature,

629
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,804
or like highly satisfy

630
00:20:56,805 --> 00:20:58,080
a very narrow need.

631
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,320
You try and need to build,

632
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,840
in this case,

633
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,160
we're trying to build a category.

634
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,320
So, that's kind of what I took away

635
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,360
to keep your eyes open

636
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,920
to category building opportunities

637
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,880
that end up being much more exciting.

638
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,400
I love that.

639
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,320
Lior, thank you so much for the time.

640
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,240
I know how busy you are

641
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,640
and I appreciate it so much.

642
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,280
This is an insightful

643
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,600
and it's an honor to have you here.

644
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,720
What are three words

645
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,240
that you would use

646
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,040
to describe yourself?

647
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,240
Oh, wow.

648
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,400
It's a great question.

649
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,320
I'm probably,

650
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,320
I've been told, right?

651
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,560
I don't know how to describe myself.

652
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,360
But I've been told I'm quiet.

653
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,960
So, that's one thing.

654
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,840
I don't speak much.

655
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,920
I've been told I'm fast.

656
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,200
I do things very fast.

657
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,760
And that's been helpful

658
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,600
in my entrepreneurial career.

659
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,200
Sometimes it's more important to be fast.

660
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,320
And I've also been called stoic.

661
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,320
Stoic.

662
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,280
So, that's it for you.

663
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah.

664
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I love that.

665
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,320
Lior, thank you so, so much.

666
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,240
Really, really great.

667
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:05,803
I appreciate

668
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:07,440
you taking the time to do this.

669
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,960
And stay safe and stay healthy.

670
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,800
You too, Michael.

671
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,120
Great talking to you.

672
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,240
Thank you very, very much.
