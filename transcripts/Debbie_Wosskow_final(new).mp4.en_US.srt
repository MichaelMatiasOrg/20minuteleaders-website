1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,920
I would say, be in the world.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,320
Invest in your network.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,400
Read relentlessly.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,600
If someone asks you to do something,

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,560
try and say yes.

6
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,600
Which is why I'm here.

7
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,109
And it drives my PA completely mad

8
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,557
because I do try to do a lot of this

9
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:15,130
because you never know.

10
00:00:15,131 --> 00:00:16,360
[--].

11
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,360
You never know.

12
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:17,840
You never know.

13
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,320
And the second one,

14
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,440
which gets me into a lot of trouble

15
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,195
is what's the worst

16
00:00:21,196 --> 00:00:22,270
that can happen. Right?

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,000
Debbie Wosskow,

18
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:53,360
thank you so much for joining me.

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,360
How are you today?

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,800
Yeah, I'm fine, thank you.

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,760
Thanks for having me,

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,440
from London.

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,600
It's dark and cold here.

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,680
I love it.

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,040
It's dark and not very cold in Tel Aviv.

26
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,560
It's actually quite nice here

27
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,720
in the middle of winter.

28
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,840
But it's great to have you here.

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,560
I can't wait to talk

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,840
about the sharing economy,

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,600
which I know has been

32
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,160
a topic of passion of yours

33
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,800
for quite some time.

34
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,640
But you've had some really

35
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,800
incredible experiences

36
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,560
with Love Home Swap,

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,480
which you sold in 2017.

38
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,640
And then, with your most recent company,

39
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,240
that you've started now with AllBright

40
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,400
from 2018, in the past two years

41
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:25,920
talking about

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,200
the professional network for women.

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,640
So, a lot to talk about.

44
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,520
But before all of that

45
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,200
I have to learn about what it's like

46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,960
to get married

47
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,480
during quarantine and covid.

48
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,040
Yeah.

49
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,360
So, I had a locked on wedding in London.

50
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,400
And I had that on about

51
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,200
the last day that it was possible

52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,120
to have a wedding

53
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,840
and it was small but perfectly formed.

54
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,720
But actually,

55
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,000
so much love in the room.

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,880
And I think for the people

57
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,480
who were there,

58
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,760
it was one of the first times

59
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,000
that they had been out

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,880
or seeing each other.

61
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,920
But the main thing was

62
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,360
that was my second marriage.

63
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,080
And I have two children

64
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,040
from my first marriage.

65
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,320
And my husband has a child

66
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,240
from his first marriage

67
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,520
and really it was their day.

68
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,320
So, it was a big party for them.

69
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,160
But just a real highlight

70
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,800
and a tough year that we've all had.

71
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,293
We will always remember 2020

72
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:14,200
for good reasons

73
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,240
as well as difficult reasons.

74
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,120
I love that.

75
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,960
That's very inspiring.

76
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,800
Debbie, tell me a little bit

77
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,640
about your journey.

78
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,600
Because it's a really interesting journey

79
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,920
looking from the side.

80
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,520
And then I'd love to transition

81
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,040
to hearing a little bit more specifically

82
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,840
about your ventures

83
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,440
and about the Sharing Economy.

84
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,600
But take me all the way back to Oxford.

85
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,640
How do you get started

86
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,440
with your entrepreneurial self?

87
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,360
And what are some of the things

88
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,640
that are guiding you

89
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,120
as you're making your decisions

90
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,560
to start these organizations?

91
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,800
You know, it's very hard to see

92
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
the narrative in a life

93
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,120
that's being lived

94
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
and going forwards.

95
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,240
But I think when you have some time

96
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,142
to reflect on your why,

97
00:02:52,143 --> 00:02:55,120
I'm from a family of entrepreneurs.

98
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,440
They wouldn't class themselves

99
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,080
as entrepreneurs

100
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,080
so, that's quite a fancy word,

101
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,000
that of a business owners

102
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,040
to self starters,

103
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,360
a Jewish immigrant family to the UK.

104
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm third generation.

105
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,400
And I grew up around people

106
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,640
who work for themselves.

107
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,360
I didn't know anybody

108
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,880
in my extended family

109
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,160
who had a conventional job.

110
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,840
In particular,

111
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,280
the women in my family,

112
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,480
my mother and my grandmother

113
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,240
who I was very close to

114
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,800
who died aged 97 a few years ago

115
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,880
were strong, tenacious women

116
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,280
who control their own destiny,

117
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,760
who ran businesses

118
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,120
and were matriarchs.

119
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,320
And that's very much, I suppose,

120
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,440
the role model that I was very used to.

121
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,560
And in that standpoint

122
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,520
two things are quite important.

123
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,120
I think everybody talks

124
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,560
about work and business

125
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,600
around the kitchen table.

126
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,520
And I'm very aware of that

127
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,480
with my own children.

128
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,880
That it was very normal

129
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,800
to talk about work.

130
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,400
I spent a lot of my formative years

131
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,600
driving around with my grandma

132
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,000
in her armored vehicle

133
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,400
which she never learnt how to reverse.

134
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,840
That's one thing we have in common.

135
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,040
Being terrible drivers.

136
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,760
Dropping money off the bank

137
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,520
and, you know,

138
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,440
it's what you see.

139
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,360
So, I think some of it is

140
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,040
you have to see it

141
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,200
to be a particular as the woman.

142
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,120
The second thing is that

143
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,960
academic excellence is non-negotiable

144
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,280
and that, you know,

145
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,200
you have to work hard at school

146
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,320
and be a be a good student.

147
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,360
So, I think those two things

148
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,200
are very formative.

149
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,120
But I do think,

150
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,680
I set up my first business at 25,

151
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,840
so, 21 years ago

152
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,120
and I think that the risks things

153
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,560
if it's normalized to be part

154
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,440
of an entrepreneurial

155
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,520
self starting community

156
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,320
did not feel risky.

157
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,280
And if I look at my siblings,

158
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,520
I'm from a big family, one of five,

159
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,160
everybody works for themselves.

160
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,480
I actually I worked with my brother

161
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,040
the next one, that one,

162
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,600
he was with the same college as me.

163
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,200
I've worked with him

164
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,120
for over a decade now.

165
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,320
My middle sister is a psychotherapist,

166
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,320
but she runs her own practice.

167
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,920
And she runs buildings.

168
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,440
I think so much of it

169
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,480
is on the nature nurture

170
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,240
debate around

171
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,520
normalization perhaps,

172
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,600
is a bit in the genes.

173
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,920
But I think it just felt like

174
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,280
what you did.

175
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,400
And I think for women,

176
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,720
if I link that to my career

177
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,960
and my business now, AllBright,

178
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,360
I think positive female role models

179
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,960
who take risks and show that

180
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,040
it's possible to start businesses

181
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,760
in your 30s,

182
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,720
which is the main age

183
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,520
to start a business

184
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,360
which is often when women

185
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,720
are having children,

186
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,440
I think really does make you see

187
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,560
the art of the possible.

188
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,160
And I think that's been

189
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,280
a big part of it for me.

190
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,640
I love that.

191
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,200
Talk to me a little bit

192
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,800
about the Love Home Swap.

193
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
So, home exchange.

194
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,680
What even is that?

195
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,760
And how do you then get into

196
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,600
being in the home swapping market?

197
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,320
You know, I think,

198
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,080
you get different types of entrepreneurs.

199
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,040
I'm quite simple in many ways

200
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,400
and that I can only start

201
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,480
and feel passionate about businesses

202
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,200
that I can relate to

203
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,120
and to some extent,

204
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,200
why I am the ultimate consumer.

205
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,400
That's not everybody's journey but mine.

206
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,520
So, all of my businesses

207
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,640
have come from a position

208
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,400
of need or personal connection.

209
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,640
And then of home swap story

210
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,240
and this is the real story,

211
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,520
not just a [--] is that

212
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,800
I went on holiday

213
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,120
when my children were tiny,

214
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,200
three months and two.

215
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,000
And the people who have young children

216
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,240
who were listening,

217
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,160
parent's holiday is a pretty miserable.

218
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,680
You know, you sit in a hotel room

219
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,040
with the lights off.

220
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,640
Watching a movie with the sound off,

221
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,760
eating room service,

222
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,640
and you're feeding one another.

223
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,280
And they're expensive

224
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,680
and they're not a life lived well.

225
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,000
And on the flight on the way back

226
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,080
from this holiday,

227
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,440
I watched the movie, The Holiday,

228
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,700
which I actually re-watched

229
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:53,400
this Christmas

230
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,200
and that's what hold up.

231
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,880
Which for those of you

232
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,600
who haven't seen it,

233
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,160
Cameron Diaz swapped homes

234
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,760
with Kate Winslet.

235
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,520
And it made me think,

236
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,720
A, inspiration can strike at any time.

237
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,680
You have to have eyes and ears open

238
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,240
and be in the world,

239
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,200
is what I was saying.

240
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,800
Right.

241
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,280
Yes, I think it's really important

242
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,000
because that's where

243
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,960
it always comes from for me.

244
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,160
But, B, made me think,

245
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,880
does that even exist?

246
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,760
Because actually,

247
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,560
the holiday that I wish I just had

248
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,120
was to stay in a home, not a hotel.

249
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,512
To swap, frankly,

250
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:26,840
at that time in my life

251
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,800
with someone else's.

252
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,560
Right.

253
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,960
And I think particularly

254
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,680
with small children,

255
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,480
to be in somewhere that

256
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,760
was more spacious in a community.

257
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,800
And this was at the very early days

258
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,960
of Airbnb.

259
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,280
So, the sharing economy,

260
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,520
which I later became

261
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,760
I suppose the sort of queen of in the UK,

262
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,040
I authored the Wosskow Report

263
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,747
to advise the UK government

264
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:50,240
on how to regulate the sharing economy.

265
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
I was the chair sharing economy UK.

266
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,120
So, that sense of making more

267
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,320
of the assets that you own

268
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,400
and the skills that you have

269
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,520
was a big part of my life

270
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,480
for about five years.

271
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,400
But at this stage, nobody,

272
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,360
nobody was thinking

273
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,280
about it in that way.

274
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,160
But I think there was the sense in which

275
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,680
we needed to make our assets sweat harder.

276
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,840
And we needed to think about,

277
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,840
perhaps, living life a bit differently.

278
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,520
So, the inspiration was the movie.

279
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,080
I suppose then the test is well,

280
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,240
what do you do about it?

281
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:22,920
And I think what entrepreneurs

282
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,760
often have in common is

283
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,320
they need an itch to scratch.

284
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,760
They are very relentless.

285
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,440
They don't let something draw up.

286
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,560
The test for me is always

287
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,960
if it gives me goose bumps

288
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,880
or am I still.

289
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:38,240
So, I just kept all night.

290
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,360
I could sort of see the market.

291
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,621
And then you know,

292
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,960
I was management consultant

293
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,880
from a million years ago.

294
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,440
So, I think you always then get to

295
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,840
to analyze an opportunity

296
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,880
and product market fit.

297
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,400
I think it's always a combination

298
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,400
of analytics and instinct for me.

299
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,760
Because my business is a B2C businesses.

300
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,160
So, you've got to be able

301
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,280
to get something up and running.

302
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,240
Consumer test it pretty quickly

303
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,800
to check it's the thing.

304
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,360
I suppose that sort of tipping point

305
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
was my brother Ben.

306
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,280
He was about to go into an MBA,

307
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,600
and I dissuaded him from doing that.

308
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,720
And I said, "I have this idea,

309
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,440
why don't you come

310
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,240
and do it with me.

311
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,881
It's for six months. I'll salary you

312
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:22,040
as my impoverished little brother."

313
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,840
And I'd already have one

314
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,760
and that's my marketing services business.

315
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,280
And that was it.

316
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,600
So, I looked at from the outside,

317
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,960
these things look super easy.

318
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,920
In equal measure, it was hard,

319
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,600
riddled with mistakes,

320
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,760
exhausting, boring.

321
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,640
Can you give me an example

322
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,960
of a mistake that you made

323
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,160
that in hindsight you're saying?

324
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,000
I think it takes, this would be

325
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,120
if I'm to give any advice

326
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,760
to people listening,

327
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,720
to really find your sweet spot

328
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,920
on product market and pricing fit

329
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,640
just takes quite a long time, right?

330
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
You don't just

331
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,520
maybe some people do,

332
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,040
but I never do.

333
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,080
So, you're always tweaking it.

334
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,840
What if it is?

335
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,640
And what if it's that?

336
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,600
And you test this, you know.

337
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,840
And we went on a few blind alleys,

338
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,320
I think.

339
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,760
The aha moment for Love Home Swap

340
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,920
was around what became known

341
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,520
as the three-way swap.

342
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,000
In other words,

343
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,760
I say for at least the first year

344
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,600
of the business,

345
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,960
we'd waste a little bit of capital.

346
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,626
I funded it.

347
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,680
We were, you know,

348
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,960
there was a thing.

349
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,480
But you could, if I'm in London

350
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,760
and you're in Tel Aviv,

351
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,120
we could only swap with one another.

352
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,760
I think it's really freeing up

353
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,760
and developing the algo

354
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,360
that enabled London

355
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,520
to swap with Tel Aviv

356
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,840
to swap with Paris.

357
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
That then meant that

358
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,000
this would be a 365 day a year.

359
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,800
You could bank credit.

360
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,360
And then I think,

361
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,040
that was inflection point one.

362
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,760
Inflection point two was realizing,

363
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,960
and this is why being in the world

364
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,400
is really important,

365
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,120
it was a bit like a modern day Timeshare.

366
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,480
Right.

367
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,360
You were essentially banking time

368
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,840
in your home as a tradable asset

369
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,960
to trade [--].

370
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,560
And that was sort of a moment,

371
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,480
because I didn't know

372
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,160
the Timeshare industry.

373
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,760
But then I, and I think

374
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,520
this is another point around commitment

375
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
and total immersion,

376
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,960
I really got to know

377
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,320
the Timeshare industry.

378
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,080
I went to all the Timeshare conferences.

379
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
I was in the room.

380
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,000
And what happened then

381
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,360
and I'm a great believer

382
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,520
in organized serendipity,

383
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,080
which is partly when we [--]

384
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,360
which I think is really important.

385
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,440
I spoke at the European

386
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,360
Timeshare Conference

387
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,240
on why I thought Home Swapping

388
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,520
was the future of Timeshare.

389
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,240
And I met someone from Wyndham,

390
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,680
the hotel group who owned RCI,

391
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,720
the Timeshare business.

392
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,640
And that was the exit. Right?

393
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,760
And I think, there's a real question mark

394
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,160
I think around

395
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,520
during the pandemic, networks,

396
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,120
in particular, networks for women.

397
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,840
And that's always been a big passion

398
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,081
that women's networks

399
00:12:11,082 --> 00:12:12,440
are not as good as men.

400
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:13,400
And networks

401
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:14,850
are how you get shit done, right?

402
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:15,890
Without networks,

403
00:12:15,891 --> 00:12:17,600
I didn't sell that business.

404
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,880
Without realizing,

405
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,520
"Okay, hang on.

406
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,240
I think it's this,

407
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,360
but actually it's this."

408
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,440
So, I would say be in the world.

409
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,840
Invest in your network.

410
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,920
Read relentlessly.

411
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,080
If someone asks you to do something

412
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
try and say yes.

413
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,045
Which is why I'm here.

414
00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:33,480
And it drives my PA completely mad

415
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,920
because I do try to do lot of this.

416
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,255
because you never know.

417
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,880
You know, [--].

418
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
You never know.

419
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,360
You never know.

420
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,840
And the second one

421
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,960
which gets me into a lot of trouble

422
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,079
is what's the worst

423
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,320
that can happen. Right?

424
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,800
Right.

425
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,960
So, between those two things,

426
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,480
you have to put yourself out there.

427
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,000
And that was Love Home Swap.

428
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,440
Beginning to end, five years, exit.

429
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,400
But honestly, there were so many moments

430
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,320
where that could not have happened

431
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,880
unless you were in the room

432
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,320
and you're always trying

433
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,760
to frame or reframe

434
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,320
what your business is.

435
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,360
And you're not don't be,

436
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,080
be passionately committed to the mission.

437
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,640
Right.

438
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,360
Don't be 100% without openness

439
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,240
committed to the original concept.

440
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,480
Because it will change.

441
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,840
It will just change, you know,

442
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,600
and you have to change with that.

443
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,040
I love that.

444
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,360
The commitment to the mission,

445
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,520
but also a commitment to being able

446
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,160
to change the concept of how you execute.

447
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
There's no weakness in that

448
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,400
in the execution.

449
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,280
You know, we pivot, I mean

450
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,720
I don't even think that as a pivot.

451
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,760
It's just life, right?

452
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,760
We're always doing that

453
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,880
to try and and change up.

454
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,160
And I don't mean to sound trite

455
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,280
and I don't want to sound trite

456
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,600
when commenting on last year,

457
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,120
but if life gives you lemons,

458
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,680
you've got to make lemonade. Right?

459
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,640
And, you know,

460
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,665
I think that

461
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,400
there's been a huge opportunity

462
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,320
in the pandemic

463
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,000
for businesses to really think about

464
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,400
how does their mission support people

465
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,840
within the pandemic.

466
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,400
Right.

467
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,160
What do consumers want.

468
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,280
What do they need.

469
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,440
How can we best service them.

470
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,360
And I think,

471
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,000
I've watched people around me

472
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,585
or businesses,

473
00:14:15,785 --> 00:14:17,726
because I'm a serial angel investor.

474
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:18,480
And in the AllBright

475
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,280
we run off female founders pitch series.

476
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,440
So we have four women pitching

477
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,160
on two occasions a month.

478
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,800
Every single month,

479
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,200
we see a lot of entrepreneurs.

480
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,400
And my advice would be,

481
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,880
you've got to roll with that.

482
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,680
And I think a surprising amount

483
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,520
of people don't

484
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,280
and you do have to.

485
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,360
I just love that.

486
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,680
And I have to say

487
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,360
that I completely agree.

488
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,440
This whole show came about in March,

489
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,920
the rather the peak

490
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,800
of the first week of the pandemic.

491
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,000
And I couldn't get into the Ubers

492
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,200
and meet interesting people

493
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,080
in the Valley.

494
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,960
So, I started meeting them

495
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,080
on Zoom, and at the end,

496
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,760
it was beautiful because

497
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,880
I believe this is episode about 300

498
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,400
or something that we're recording.

499
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,960
And just it's through a lemonade

500
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,720
that's coming out of this.

501
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,120
And I'm so thankful for people like you

502
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,360
that are willing to come on the show

503
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,840
and share their experience and insights.

504
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,080
Debbie, tell me a little bit about

505
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,000
the sharing economy

506
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,680
and then I'd love to move towards

507
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,480
talking about AllBright

508
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,240
and the amazing work

509
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,880
that you're doing there

510
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,200
for networking with women.

511
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,000
You know,

512
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,680
I suppose my final point

513
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,640
on the sharing economy

514
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,120
and people have the stomach for it,

515
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,880
you know, I wrote like a 100,000 words

516
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,840
on this thing so you can go and read them.

517
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,760
With huge opportunity

518
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,360
comes masses of responsibility.

519
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,680
That's life, right?

520
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
So, what was the opportunity

521
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,280
that because of digital platforms,

522
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,360
digital payment platforms,

523
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,040
that's been the big game changer

524
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,760
for the sharing economy.

525
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,600
Businesses like, starts with paper

526
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,440
but stripe, that mean that

527
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,520
I can set up a platform

528
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,880
and take money in real time,

529
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,400
anyone, anywhere without going

530
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,360
into too much detail.

531
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,720
When we first started Love Home Swap

532
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,640
you couldn't do that.

533
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,440
Right?

534
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,680
So, we were having like banking accounts

535
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,120
with money on escrow,

536
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,200
30 day payment.

537
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,120
You know, not possible.

538
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,280
Everything's changed over a decade.

539
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,920
Comes huge responsibility.

540
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,320
And as ever, you know,

541
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,720
I'm a philosophy graduate,

542
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,480
so, I like big questions.

543
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,960
Some existential questions,

544
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,320
what does it mean to be employed?

545
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,760
How should people work?

546
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,680
What is the future of work look like?

547
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,800
What are the responsibilities

548
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,720
of platforms?

549
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,560
What does it mean

550
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
to be self-employed?

551
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,000
What's the responsibility of the state?

552
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,400
You know, it's like really big stuff.

553
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,880
And I think it's the most seismic shift

554
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,120
of the last 50 years.

555
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,084
And it has been exacerbated

556
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:51,320
by the pandemic.

557
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,200
We can work differently.

558
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,680
We have to work differently. Right?

559
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,160
It's a huge opportunity.

560
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,560
It's an absolute radical shift

561
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,640
in the world of work.

562
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,560
And it has the potential

563
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,800
to create massive problems

564
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,440
around ethics welfare

565
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,120
and the way that we look after people.

566
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,080
So, you know, it's not an easy one.

567
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,400
But I like that kind of thing

568
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,280
because I think that the more people,

569
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,160
not just with theoretical brains

570
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,360
but with practical experience,

571
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,560
you can try and think around

572
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,960
those challenges the better.

573
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:24,640
And I think that the relationship

574
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,200
between policy making

575
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,600
and real life entrepreneurial

576
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,080
and front line

577
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,520
business experience matters.

578
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,040
And which is why

579
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,240
I always have something

580
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,360
like that in the go the moment

581
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,069
I'm on the mayor

582
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,760
of London's business board.

583
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,200
I think that

584
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,600
we should have a voice.

585
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,400
We've got a response

586
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,120
but we can't complain

587
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,520
about the laws that are made

588
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,280
across the world

589
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,920
if we're not standing up

590
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,800
and being counted.

591
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,320
So, I always like to stand up

592
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,000
and be counted.

593
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I just love that.

594
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,960
And in just a few words,

595
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,880
a little bit about AllBright,

596
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,960
and why you're spending

597
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,600
your time now working

598
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,760
with this professional network.

599
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,800
So look, I guess

600
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,520
again with this

601
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,040
sort of benefit of hindsight

602
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,040
sweep of history thing,

603
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm so used to being

604
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,160
the only woman in the room

605
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,960
that I didn't even notice anymore, right?

606
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,600
You're woman who raises capital

607
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,960
then you are so in the minority,

608
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,160
you know,

609
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,720
two percent of capital goes

610
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,480
to back a female founder.

611
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,240
Seven percent of investors are female.

612
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,320
Two percent of partner level.

613
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,080
One in six in leadership positions

614
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,880
in corporates.

615
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,440
The stats for backing female founders

616
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,360
are going down.

617
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,800
The pandemic has made it work.

618
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,280
You know, like come on.

619
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,800
So, I think to this point on serendipity

620
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,600
and being in the world,

621
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,880
there have been different points

622
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,240
in my life that change your life,

623
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,080
different people that you meet

624
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,920
that change your life,

625
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,160
that you have to be open to.

626
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,320
And I met Anna Jones,

627
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,960
she's my co-founder in AllBright,

628
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,000
at a party four years ago.

629
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,440
A party I nearly didn't go to.

630
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,080
And she was the CEO of Hearst,

631
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,040
the publishing magazines business.

632
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,960
A mutual friend introduced us.

633
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,040
She said, "You two should be friends."

634
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,920
And the world changed

635
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,160
because we bonded over lots of things.

636
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,560
Life, the universe, everything.

637
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,080
Kids the same age.

638
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,600
We live in the same part of London.

639
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,320
You know, we like

640
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,120
high heels and sequined dresses,

641
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,480
whatever, but primarily,

642
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,806
"where are all the women"

643
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:21,760
became the theme.

644
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,480
Right.

645
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
And if we were going to set up a business

646
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,760
that combined purpose with profit

647
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,880
as my fourth business

648
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,080
that's going to get me out of bed

649
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,720
in the morning,

650
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,840
the one topic that I care about

651
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,720
more than anything

652
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,800
is driving gender equality

653
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,600
and changing the world of work for women.

654
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,560
Not just entrepreneurs,

655
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
but every woman.

656
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,040
Because it has not changed fast enough.

657
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,520
And so, that's what AllBright's about.

658
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,391
It's called AllBright

659
00:19:47,392 --> 00:19:48,920
after the Madeleine quote is,

660
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,261
"There's a special place in hell

661
00:19:50,262 --> 00:19:52,640
for women who don't help other women."

662
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,360
So, our hypothesis is this,

663
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,920
that if women have better networks,

664
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,480
if they can upscale,

665
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,360
if they can access capital,

666
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,480
if they can build confidence

667
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,120
in resilience,

668
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,040
then we're going to change

669
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,640
the conversation for women at work.

670
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,200
So, it's a very ambitious protective.

671
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,040
We want to build

672
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,320
what we call amongst a global sisterhood

673
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,760
of smart minded ambitious women.

674
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,880
And there are two parts to the business.

675
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,680
Physical space,

676
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,850
which stands for something

677
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:19,651
above and beyond bricks and mortar

678
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,080
challenging at the moment.

679
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,320
Some open, some shut.

680
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,775
We've got buildings in the states,

681
00:20:23,776 --> 00:20:24,440
buildings here.

682
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,640
And then what has been

683
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,160
a massive opportunity

684
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,040
and hopefully a huge support

685
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,720
during the pandemic

686
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,960
is our digital platform.

687
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,000
So, for anyone listening,

688
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,720
I'm afraid you do have

689
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,360
to be a woman to do this.

690
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,800
But go into the app store

691
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,640
and find the AllBright digital app.

692
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,320
And it's a page product.

693
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,560
But you get two weeks for free

694
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,200
and then it's $120 a year.

695
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,987
There's tons

696
00:20:51,988 --> 00:20:53,640
of upscaling content in there.

697
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,560
And Anna and I wrote a book

698
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,480
called "Believe. Build. Become.:

699
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,800
How to Supercharge Your Career".

700
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,720
That was out last year,

701
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,800
which you should also check out.

702
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,320
And a lot of the content's on that.

703
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:03,560
Right?

704
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,320
So, everything.

705
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,280
How to negotiate a pay rise,

706
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,720
how to deal with imposter syndrome,

707
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,080
Amazing.

708
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,960
Loads and loads

709
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,200
and loads of women teaching.

710
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,800
And then there's a community.

711
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,000
And that's really important.

712
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So, it's LinkedIn me

713
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,320
as Masterclass for women, if you like.

714
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,000
The community got loads of groups.

715
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,640
It's incredibly active.

716
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,240
And we have something called

717
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,600
sisterhood matching,

718
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,800
which is like online dating

719
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,560
for career women.

720
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,160
Amazing.

721
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,240
Match you up with other women

722
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:35,920
around the world

723
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,800
with similar interest backgrounds,

724
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,600
objectives.

725
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,000
So, it's an incredibly vibrant community.

726
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,920
Bigger, better than ever

727
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,760
because of the pandemic.

728
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,800
And I would encourage

729
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,040
all of the women listening to this

730
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,240
to check out AllBright Digital

731
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,560
and also check out our book,

732
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,680
which is very practical.

733
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,880
So, at the end of every chapter,

734
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
we met, you work.

735
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,080
There's a lot of exercises

736
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,040
you got to practice, practice, practice.

737
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,360
And that's one of our key messages

738
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
that it doesn't just happen

739
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,160
that you have to work at this.

740
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,040
For Anna and I,

741
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,480
even though it all looks

742
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,560
effortless every game,

743
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,920
everything from,

744
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,520
you know, dresses to delivery.

745
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,040
And we would encourage other women

746
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,840
to feel like they can do the same.

747
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,720
Debbie, I love that.

748
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,040
Thank you for the inspiration.

749
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,640
By the way,

750
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,360
that's exactly also the point that I,

751
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,200
that's important for me

752
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
to address in this show.

753
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,320
You remember one of the first question

754
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,960
that I asked was,

755
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,040
what are some mistakes

756
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,200
you've made with Love Home Swap.

757
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,600
Because I think that's just such

758
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,800
an integral part of every journey.

759
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,960
And sometimes we forget

760
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,680
when we look at

761
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,880
these incredible success stories,

762
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,440
that every success

763
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,680
comes after a multitude of failures

764
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,200
in small, perhaps failures

765
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,280
but leading up to that,

766
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,320
to those aha moments

767
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,000
that at the end seem so linear

768
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,680
with a narrative.

769
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,560
But like you said,

770
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,480
it's much easier looking

771
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,800
backwards than forwards.

772
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,840
Debbie, before we finish,

773
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,280
I want to thank you

774
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,600
for being so generous with your time.

775
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,320
And I'd love to ask

776
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,040
the most important question,

777
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,080
which is three words

778
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,480
that you would use

779
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,240
to describe yourself.

780
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,680
Gosh. I would say determined, tenacious,

781
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,280
and on a good day, hopefully fun.

782
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,880
Debbie, thank you very, very much.

783
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,600
Best of luck with the

784
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,200
dark, cold London right now.

785
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,942
And I can't wait

786
00:23:12,943 --> 00:23:13,960
to share this with the world.

787
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,600
Thank you.

788
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,500
Okay. Thanks a lot.
