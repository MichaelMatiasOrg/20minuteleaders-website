1
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,240
Okay. Wonderful.

2
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,480
Jeff Hyman, thank you so much

3
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,470
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

4
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,320
Thanks for having me.

5
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,680
Really really great to have you.

6
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,200
You know, you had such interesting

7
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,360
positions in the legal space,

8
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,880
but also in the HR space.

9
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,040
So I believe you started, you were the general counsel

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,080
and you started the HR

11
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,560
at Pebble Technology, which I love.

12
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,320
I backed both Kickstarters.

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
Incredible.

14
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,078
Thank you

15
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,680
And then ... senior director at Google,

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,440
advisor to several companies.

17
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,640
I think Boosted Boards

18
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,960
was one of them?

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,195
Yeah.

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,960
It's one of my dreams.

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,080
It's one of my life goals

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,920
to be able to ride

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,680
on the Boosted board,

24
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,880
but I'm terrified.

25
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,680
So, maybe you'll ease my concern.

26
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,360
And you're an adjunct professor

27
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,520
at Santa Clara University

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,840
teaching about the legal aspect

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,800
of startups.

30
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,320
Jeff, what does that mean?

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,200
What does that mean

32
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,600
the legal aspect of startups?

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,280
Well, in the course at the law school,

34
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,160
what we do is

35
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,360
I try to present to the students

36
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,240
what the arc of legal issues are

37
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,680
that startups face from formation

38
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,360
to raising capital

39
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,240
and dealing with VCs.

40
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,580
And then key issues about

41
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,960
contracts and hiring people

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,400
and employment law issues.

43
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,760
And then ultimately

44
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,960
working towards M&A

45
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,000
and going public.

46
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,280
And throughout it

47
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,920
the focus of the class is really about

48
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,520
educating the students a bit

49
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,440
on some of the key legal issues

50
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,640
at every one of those steps,

51
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,240
but it's really about how do you function

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,400
in a startup as a lawyer

53
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,480
and what's the most useful way

54
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,840
to be a partner to all of the other

55
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,920
business stakeholders in a company

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,520
in charting solutions to navigate

57
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,200
through all those legal issues.

58
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,760
So, take me through this lifecycle

59
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,120
from you're joining at Pebble

60
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,200
as very early employee, right?

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
I think 35th employee.

62
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,680
What does that mean

63
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,160
being a good partner

64
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,360
at an early stage startup?

65
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,680
And then take me through the journey

66
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,040
of the startup up until the IPO.

67
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,800
So, I think it's really that,

68
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,680
it's an important distinction between

69
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,680
being like a law firm lawyer

70
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,000
or even working at a

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
big company legal department

72
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,280
like I did it at Intel or Apple where,

73
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,880
when you're a huge company

74
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,960
you have so much at stake,

75
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,240
so much at risk

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,680
and a lot to protect and to worry about.

77
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,240
And what a lot of those

78
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,480
companies’ legal practices

79
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,280
are really about

80
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,360
is identifying and managing risk,

81
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,840
whereas in a startup

82
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,320
you have very little to protect

83
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,200
and it's really about you're trying

84
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,760
to do something new

85
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,960
and you're trying to create and build.

86
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,440
And so the orientation I think there is,

87
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,800
and this certainly was my attitude

88
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,280
when I got to Pebble,

89
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,800
you show up

90
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,120
and there is no legal department,

91
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,880
there's nothing.

92
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,600
And there's a business that's trying

93
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,720
to accomplish something.

94
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,080
And really, your job

95
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,520
as the general counsel or legal counsel

96
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,840
is understand what the business

97
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,720
is trying to do

98
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,280
and figure out how can you help

99
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,280
make that happen.

100
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,560
And along the way,

101
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,520
how do you help build the company

102
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,080
and make sure that the company

103
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,680
is making really smart choices

104
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,560
about how it's pursuing

105
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,280
those business opportunities

106
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,360
in a smart way.

107
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,680
How it's complying with the laws

108
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,000
that it needs to comply with

109
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,800
or at least making really informed choices

110
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,360
when it's not.

111
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,960
And sometimes that's part of

112
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,920
what startups have to do too.

113
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,960
But then also being really smart about,

114
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,280
particularly in a technology startup,

115
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,200
you have a great idea

116
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,000
and now you're executing to it.

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,200
How do you do that in a way

118
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,520
that's gonna be protectable

119
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,960
so that you have

120
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,160
a differentiated advantage

121
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,320
and you're able to protect

122
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,400
that differentiation

123
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,160
sometimes through intellectual property,

124
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,280
sometimes through how you set up contracts and

125
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,080
relationships with external parties, etc.

126
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,280
So, there's a lot.

127
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,400
Yeah. I mean, looking in the background,

128
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,560
so besides being a part

129
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,760
of these huge companies,

130
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
very successful companies,

131
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,280
you've taken a very active role

132
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,240
within those more Internet of things

133
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,520
devices like wearable technology,

134
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
like the Boosted boards.

135
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,440
So, I'm guessing there, the IP plays

136
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,640
a pretty strong part, right?

137
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,280
Because especially today

138
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,360
you create some new wearable device,

139
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,440
and all of a sudden

140
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,400
across the sea on the east,

141
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,680
you have companies doing

142
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,560
almost the same thing for much cheaper.

143
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,280
So, what are the different challenges there

144
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,400
that you've seen with these

145
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,160
different companies

146
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,800
that you've worked with?

147
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,920
Well, that's and that's really, I think,

148
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,040
especially in the hardware space,

149
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,040
that's really one of the big challenges.

150
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,440
You can have

151
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,880
If you looked at like a Pebble watch or,

152
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,000
I had the same thought when GoPro

153
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,400
came out with their camera,

154
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,240
when you tear those devices down,

155
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,040
they're just made up full of commodity

156
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,880
off the shelf parts

157
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,880
that anybody can tear it open and copy it.

158
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,200
And if they can offer it at a lower price

159
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,400
because they have cheaper labor,

160
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,840
whatever the case may be,

161
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,080
you're in big trouble.

162
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,400
So, if you wanna have something

163
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,320
that's gonna give you a sustained

164
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,880
differentiated advantage to compete,

165
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,320
you've got to bring something

166
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,160
that isn't so easy to knock off.

167
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,800
And what are those things?

168
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,360
Well, at Pebble, one of the things

169
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,560
that we had was we had software.

170
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,000
We had a distinct UI.

171
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,720
We had a set of software features.

172
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,880
We had a really impressive back-end

173
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,960
cloud based systems.

174
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,080
We had a technology community.

175
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,480
Yeah, I developed apps for my Pebble.

176
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,080
Yeah. So, those are the kinds of things

177
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,360
that if you're smart about how you do it,

178
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,600
those can start to create moats

179
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,040
that will defend your competitive advantage

180
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,560
so long as people like the product.

181
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,120
I mean ultimately all these things,

182
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,240
they all devolve down

183
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,640
to the basic question of:

184
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,440
Are you doing something

185
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,760
that consumers want?

186
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,640
That's the ultimate challenge,

187
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,680
but I think that you can be smart

188
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,160
about how you decide

189
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,440
whether you're gonna try

190
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,120
to protect things through patents

191
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,480
and there's criteria and strategies around

192
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
figuring out that.

193
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,760
There's also a lot of strategy around

194
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,200
when there are things that

195
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,800
are actually hard about

196
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,600
what makes your product work

197
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,560
or how you assemble your product,

198
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,240
and if you keep those things secret,

199
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,720
you can give yourself some advantage

200
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,120
as well. So how you maintain

201
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,960
your trade secrets is important.

202
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,800
So, there's lots of different strategies

203
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,760
and law plays a part of figuring out

204
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,880
how effective a moat can you build

205
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,840
around the business.

206
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,040
And then how does that play, though,

207
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,560
into your role as leading the HR

208
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,520
at a company like Pebble?

209
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,480
Because in my mind, legal and HR

210
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,960
don't necessarily go hand in hand.

211
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,880
So, it's really yeah,

212
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,800
it's really interesting.

213
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,480
When I joined the Pebble

214
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,800
the first day I showed up

215
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
there was a recruiter

216
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,880
and he asked me to go

217
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,080
into a conference room and he said,

218
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,640
"Hey, you know,

219
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,440
you're also in charge of HR.

220
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,080
There's some things

221
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,240
that you need to know about."

222
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,320
And so, it isn't actually that strange

223
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,560
because the intersection,

224
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,720
there's a lot of HR that's really about

225
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,040
not only complying with a whole host

226
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,080
of employment laws,

227
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,760
which are really important,

228
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,160
but a lot of those laws are there

229
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,240
when you think about it

230
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,200
to protect and promote the interests

231
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,160
of the team and the employees.

232
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,200
And when you think in a startup

233
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,000
about what's something

234
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
that's really important,

235
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,120
well, it's the team

236
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,960
and the culture of the company.

237
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,040
And so for me, I had

238
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,640
a really natural interest and passion

239
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,720
for doing the HR work.

240
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,680
I still love doing it.

241
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,960
And I was really,

242
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,760
I was thrilled to get to wear

243
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,160
both of those hats

244
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,640
because sometimes

245
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,040
when you're doing the legal work,

246
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,160
it can be a little isolating

247
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,280
from the team writ large,

248
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,280
and you're doing things

249
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,920
that are important but maybe

250
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,040
don't resonate with everybody.

251
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,240
When you work in HR,

252
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,520
you're doing stuff that affects

253
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,920
everybody all the time

254
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,520
and the feedback loop is instantaneous.

255
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,880
You hear from people all the time

256
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,000
which I enjoyed most of the time.

257
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,640
I love it. I love it. Okay.

258
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,000
And now I'm gonna be starting a startup,

259
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,880
hopefully sooner rather than later.

260
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,280
And how can I as a founder,

261
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,960
as an entrepreneur,

262
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,880
I know nothing about legal.

263
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,480
How can I even go and approach

264
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,800
doing things the right way

265
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,400
and understanding and really complying

266
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,120
with the right things,

267
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,520
but also thinking strategically

268
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,320
about protecting the stuff that I'm doing?

269
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,760
Do I bring somebody in-house?

270
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,960
Do I go outside to a different company?

271
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,520
Sort of what's the best practices

272
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,280
with your insight

273
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,320
over years in this industry?

274
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,280
Well, now what you're gonna do

275
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,960
is call me.

276
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,280
Okay. Okay, it's done.

277
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,280
That's it.

278
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,760
So that's, you know it's funny

279
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,040
'cause that's really what this

280
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,160
consulting business that I run now

281
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,880
is really, in a way,

282
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,680
it's sort of my solution to the problem

283
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,960
that you just raised is.

284
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,960
When you're starting out

285
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,480
and it's early days,

286
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,440
it doesn't make sense to hire

287
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,960
a full time lawyer

288
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,360
at a really early stage startup.

289
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,880
But there are so many things

290
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,120
that even in the early stages

291
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,400
that founders want to get right

292
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,080
and they need,

293
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,680
they're not intuitive.

294
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,880
Most founders are technical.

295
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,360
Sometimes they're sales or

296
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,760
marketing oriented people,

297
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,680
but there's no reason to assume

298
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,600
that you would have

299
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,360
this very specialized knowledge

300
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,640
and the wisdom of experience to know

301
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,360
what are some of the better solutions

302
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,560
than others.

303
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,520
So, you can read a lot on the web

304
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,180
and then I think a lot of founders do,

305
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,000
and some of it's good,

306
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,920
and some if it's not.

307
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,520
There's lots and lots of law firms

308
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,440
you can go to.

309
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,480
And law firms are great at,

310
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,640
if you go to a good one,

311
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,280
there's a lot of subject matter knowledge,

312
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,480
but there isn't always a lot

313
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,920
of practical wisdom

314
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,880
and sort of street smarts.

315
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,480
And so, ultimately,

316
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,320
I think what you want

317
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,760
as a founder is to say,

318
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,160
"Okay, don't just tell me what the law is,

319
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,240
but tell me practically

320
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,800
what's the smartest way

321
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,480
to get from where I am

322
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,800
to where you understand I wanna go."

323
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,920
And I think that's really what makes

324
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,320
for a great in-house lawyer

325
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,240
or even somebody like me

326
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,880
who's a part time GC

327
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,720
and head of HR for lots of startups.

328
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,200
Somebody who brings

329
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,000
that perspective up in reality

330
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,920
like you're always weighing

331
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,360
risk against benefit. Right.

332
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,400
And sometimes, it can be expensive

333
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,240
to comply with every single detail

334
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,480
or to try to tackle

335
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,280
all the problems at once.

336
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,920
And you have to prioritize.

337
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,480
So, having that practical experience

338
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,040
to know, like,

339
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,920
what do I really need to do right now?

340
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,800
What can wait?

341
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,680
What's a good enough solution

342
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,760
vs. the Cadillac?

343
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,680
And you don't always need the Cadillac.

344
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,320
That's really the kind

345
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,680
of practical experience that you need.

346
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,280
But even in, especially in legal,

347
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,720
you have to specialize

348
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,680
in a lot of these things,

349
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,760
and especially when you're talking

350
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,320
about intellectual property

351
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,600
It sounds like you almost have to be

352
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,440
somewhat of an expert on the technology

353
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,600
that this company is developing.

354
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,280
And you're going from smartwatches

355
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,760
to electric scooter boards

356
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,440
to Google, Intel, Apple.

357
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,640
How do you understand the technology?

358
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,960
And how much of a deep dive do you actually need

359
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,520
to have within each of these realms in order

360
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,320
to be giving really good advice?

361
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,160
Well, it's one of the things

362
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,320
that's really fun about working

363
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,280
in the Valley is if you're interested

364
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,080
in technology and in business,

365
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,240
which I am both of those,

366
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,600
as well as the law.

367
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,480
I've had a lot of people I've worked with

368
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,320
say that I'm a business person

369
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,560
who happens also to be a lawyer.

370
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,520
And I try to think of it that way, too.

371
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,560
So, over a number of years,

372
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,480
you work on a lot

373
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,920
of different kinds of things

374
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,520
and you learn from hopefully really smart

375
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,560
mentors and practitioners.

376
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,600
But then, yeah,

377
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,880
you do have to learn the technology

378
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,960
because it it can be relevant sometimes

379
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,920
And sometimes it's not.

380
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,960
I mean, to help address

381
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,520
employment law issues,

382
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,480
it's not necessary that you know much

383
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,240
about the business or the product

384
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,080
or the technology.

385
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,760
But certainly when you're thinking

386
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,960
about intellectual property matters

387
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,480
or even structuring partnerships

388
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,160
with outside companies,

389
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,480
particularly if it involves like

390
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,200
manufacturing or licensing technologies,

391
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,680
you do need to understand at some level.

392
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,280
You don't have to be an engineer,

393
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,960
but the more you understand,

394
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,880
I think it can help you a lot.

395
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:02,440
Definitely.

396
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,080
And so, looking over all these companies

397
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,440
and all these years in your industry,

398
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,920
what are some of the common pitfalls

399
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,000
that you see founders or entrepreneurs

400
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,040
make along the way

401
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,640
that could be avoided?

402
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,760
I'm looking at myself,

403
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,520
things that I wanna write down

404
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,240
that I wanna make sure

405
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,280
that I do things right as I go along

406
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,720
my own entrepreneurial journey.

407
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:27,480
Gosh. Every startup that I've worked with,

408
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,840
and I'm working with

409
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,560
four companies right now,

410
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,280
they all struggle with a lot

411
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,680
of people related issues.

412
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,360
A lot of employment law issues.

413
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,400
Interesting.

414
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,160
And I think they also struggle with

415
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:49,080
how to build and manage teams

416
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,720
and do some of the compensation strategy.

417
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,720
Like all of that people related stuff

418
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,200
is a challenge.

419
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,400
And that's partly because

420
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,520
none of it's intuitive at all.

421
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,920
Like there's nothing intuitive

422
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,440
about employment law.

423
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,920
It's detailed and in California

424
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,480
it's shocking and surprising

425
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,880
what the law actually requires sometimes.

426
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,440
It's very unclear to both sides, right?

427
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,480
Both the employer and the employee

428
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,560
It can be. It absolutely can be.

429
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,120
And there can be a tremendous

430
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,680
amount of problem

431
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,480
when the relationship goes south.

432
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,600
And that can happen, right.

433
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,160
So, getting a lot on this

434
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,400
people related issues is a challenge.

435
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:35,440
I think also, that when founders early on

436
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,920
start engaging with the outside world,

437
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,520
whether it's through contracts

438
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,960
or through collaboration,

439
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,480
talking about technology

440
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,920
developing technology with outsiders,

441
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,320
getting that right with both

442
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,720
in terms of the contracts

443
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,720
that the companies are signing

444
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,920
and the contracts that they're not signing

445
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,800
and putting in place is sort of another area

446
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,240
where I see a lot of opportunity

447
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,320
to benefit from working with someone

448
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,560
who can guide you through that.

449
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,360
I think there's, naturally there's a desire to,

450
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,440
you see a problem you wanna go solve it.

451
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,160
And there's a smart person or a company

452
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,480
that's got some technology

453
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,600
that's interesting.

454
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,440
Let's just dive in

455
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,880
and solve the technical problem.

456
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,440
But if you don't set that up right,

457
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,880
and especially sometimes

458
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,600
before the work begins,

459
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,240
you can really be creating

460
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,160
some difficult problems

461
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,920
that you're gonna have to dig out of

462
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,560
after the fact.

463
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,040
100%. Is it very common

464
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,400
in your industry to go broad

465
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,080
and being at four companies

466
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:39,920
at the same time?

467
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,000
Or do people at your caliber usually go

468
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,000
and do a deep dive into one company?

469
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,320
It's a mix, I think.

470
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,640
I mean, clearly what I'm doing

471
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,040
I think is not the conventional path.

472
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,160
I mean, I've done being a part

473
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,320
of big companies and smaller ones full time.

474
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,120
By the way, what's the difference in that?

475
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,240
So, being in huge companies like Google,

476
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,520
and then being in small companies

477
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,840
like Pebble. Give me a little bit

478
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,920
of a taste of how different it is

479
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,550
from your perspective.

480
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Well, so, if you think about the time

481
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,480
that I was at Apple,

482
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,270
I was part of the hardware legal team.

483
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,590
And within the whole legal team,

484
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,400
there was the software legal team,

485
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,600
and there was Internet services

486
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,360
which at the time was iTunes,

487
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,440
and the bookstore and all of that.

488
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,080
And then there was the privacy team

489
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,280
and the litigation team

490
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,480
and the patent team.

491
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,840
And so, the whole point though,

492
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,830
is you start getting specialization

493
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,720
and a more narrow focus.

494
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:44,360
So, even while I was a senior person

495
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,160
and ultimately led

496
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,240
the hardware legal team at Apple,

497
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,760
I had nothing to do

498
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,600
with all the really interesting things

499
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,560
that Apple was doing

500
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,350
in software and services

501
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,920
and it's completely cool

502
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,960
ways of setting up the Apple stores

503
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,510
and how Apple was selling.

504
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,750
I had nothing to do with that.

505
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,750
Yeah.

506
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,120
So, that focus and specialization

507
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,680
and sort of staying in your lane

508
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,520
is sort of the hallmark of working

509
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,920
at a big legal department.

510
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,200
And I had done that kind of work

511
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,030
for a long time at Intel and Apple.

512
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,240
And I was desperate

513
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,480
to get out of that narrow lane

514
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,310
and have the breadth of all the issues.

515
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,320
And also, when you're

516
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,800
at an Intel or an Apple,

517
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,590
it's like a giant aircraft carrier.

518
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,200
And it will be just fine

519
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,640
whether you're there or not.

520
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,160
And it turns very slowly.

521
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,680
I wanted to go to an early stage company

522
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:42,320
where whether I showed up to work or not

523
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,400
and the work that I was doing

524
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,680
was actually gonna make an

525
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,400
important value impact to the company.

526
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,440
And so, that's really what led me

527
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,000
to go to Pebble and have my first

528
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,550
startup experience.

529
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,480
And I've worked with

530
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,640
many startups since then.

531
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,520
What I like about playing the role

532
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,480
I play now as a part time GC

533
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,800
and head of HR is you get an exposure

534
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,160
At any one time

535
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,520
you've got this group of companies

536
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,200
you're working with

537
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,960
So, there's really interesting variety,

538
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,310
different technologies.

539
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
All my companies are very very different

540
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,070
from each other in their focus.

541
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,110
And you get this breadth of

542
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,160
people and experiences

543
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,040
and you're constantly learning

544
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,560
and then you can take those lessons

545
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,480
and apply them across all the companies.

546
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,560
So instead of being,

547
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,920
all of my experiences

548
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,480
what it's like to work at Pebble,

549
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,040
I actually now have the experience

550
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,550
of having worked with, I think,

551
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,760
eight or nine different startups

552
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,320
over the past few years with a detour

553
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,520
to be a business executive

554
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,030
at Google in between.

555
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,480
And so, I just love it. It's fun

556
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,480
and the variety is there

557
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,790
and I just really enjoy it quite a bit.

558
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,560
I mean, you're almost like

559
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,760
a walking AI machine

560
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,520
because you have all this data in your head

561
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,680
about all these different companies

562
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,640
and I'm guessing some things are

563
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,760
starting to come up that you say,

564
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,240
"Yeah. Well, I've seen something similar

565
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,040
a few years ago at this company."

566
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,960
And that just transcends every experience

567
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,000
that somebody can get in university

568
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,320
or reading in a textbook

569
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,360
because you actually lived

570
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,830
through crises.

571
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,550
You've lived through successes.

572
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,880
And you've seen all the different

573
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,750
complexities of these problems.

574
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,560
I mean, you hear investors talk

575
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,270
about pattern recognition.

576
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,960
And it's the same thing.

577
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,760
And it's funny because one of the things

578
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,040
that you constantly hear about

579
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:43,030
in the Valley is sometimes founders

580
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,880
greatly discount the value of experience.

581
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,510
They build a team and they're like,

582
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
"Just give me somebody who is smart,

583
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,510
enthusiastic, and they can be great."

584
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,000
And sometimes that's right,

585
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,310
but that pattern recognition

586
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,070
and the wisdom of knowing

587
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,590
when this kind of problem has come up.

588
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,160
I've seen this movie 50 times before

589
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,840
and I know that if you go this way

590
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,720
or if you go that way,

591
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,480
so, the smart route is go this way.

592
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,270
Like you only get that from experience.

593
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,480
And so what's fun now is to be able

594
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,440
to operate with that experience

595
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,720
and be able to apply

596
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,160
that wisdom of experience.

597
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,830
And it's really beneficial for companies

598
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,800
and it's a thrill to kind of

599
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,320
be presented with a problem

600
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,600
and you're able to offer

601
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,160
this perspective to the founders.

602
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:30,840
Most of the time

603
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,160
they're really really appreciative of that.

604
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,320
And that's also the kind of thing

605
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,560
that even the law firm lawyers

606
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,750
I think struggle with because

607
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,310
they're much more doctrinal

608
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,720
and they're still in the business of

609
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,520
identifying risk 'cause no law firm

610
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,160
ever wants to be in a position where

611
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,000
something bad happens at a company.

612
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,960
And you go back to the law firm and say,

613
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,550
"You didn't tell me about this.

614
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,920
You didn't warn me about that."

615
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,640
So, they're really in the business

616
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,070
of warning and risk mitigation

617
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,680
whereas I'm more in the business of saying,

618
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,200
"How do I move the company forward

619
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,600
but also navigate around or

620
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,520
through some of these legal issues"

621
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,240
I love it. Okay.

622
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,680
So, Jeff, expect a call from me

623
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,600
hopefully in less than a few years

624
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,160
for my startup.

625
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,360
But before that, I need three words

626
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,440
that best describe you.

627
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,880
All right. I'm gonna go with optimistic.

628
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,440
All right.

629
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,195
Determined.

630
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,960
A lawyer saying optimistic. Interesting.

631
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,360
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

632
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,550
Determined.

633
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,440
And I think the third one

634
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,830
would be evolving.

635
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,480
I love it. I love it very much.

636
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,080
And Jeff, I'm really glad to be

637
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,720
learning all this from you.

638
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,240
And we're both involved with J-Ventures

639
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,000
and I just love how I get to be exposed

640
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,840
to all these incredible

641
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,040
people like yourself.

642
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,240
So, thank you for everything

643
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,880
that you're teaching me

644
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,840
and I look forward to continue

645
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,350
collaborating in the fund.

646
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,320
And I look forward to working

647
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,790
together in the future.

648
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,960
That'd be great. Thanks a lot.

649
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,640
This was a lot of fun.

650
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,110
Thank you. Take care.

651
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,280
Bye bye.
