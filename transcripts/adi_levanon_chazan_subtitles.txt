Adi Levanon Chazan, I'm so happy we're finally doing this. Thank you for the time. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. This is going to be so much fun. And there's so much that I want to talk about. But first, I wanted to start with your journey. Because just going over your background, I got overwhelmed by seeing the number of different places that you've gone through the venture capital firms, to product tech companies, and then, back to venture capital firms across continents. So, Adi, dumbed it down for me. How do you get to where you are now at Flint Capital and helping invest in Israel, but also previously New York. Talk to me about your journey. Yeah, for sure. So, I'm American originally. I'm actually from your neck of the woods right now. So, I grew up in Palo Alto. Parents were Israeli. Moved to Israel when I was 12 with the family. And basically everything I've done after the army was either in startups or in venture capital, some shape or form. I'm a lawyer, but I don't practice. I guess, some call it a recovering lawyer. And yeah, I mean, I think, I've been in different places because I've just been fortunate basically every time to get more exposure, more responsibility. I started off, like I said, as a lawyer, at the one of Israel's first million dollar Internet companies, called Conduit. I start up there as legal counsel. And then, I moved on to manage the compliance team. Michael, you're on mute. Thank you very much. When you go to study law and you go to law school, do you go there with the perception that you want to be a lawyer later on at a tech company? Or, do you just say, Okay, I want to be a lawyer because I'm interested in law? Yeah. It's a really good question. So, I can give you my perspective because it's only from my point of view. But I always, I think for me, the way I got to where I am now is basically I always think a few steps ahead. So, I knew in my mind that even though I liked a lot and enjoyed it, the things I liked most were contract law and business law. So, I knew that even if I would join as legal counsel, I always had the desire to go to the business side at some point. Which I think is why I became legal counsel is my first job as a lawyer. And I basically went down that road. Right? So, from Legal Counsel of the company, then I managed a compliance team. Which in many ways was a combination of, was between law, but also a lot of business, and also very technical. I've managed a team of developers and analyst, and create with the R&D teams. Yeah. And at that time we had two main clients, were Google and Microsoft team. So, I had to be the many ways, the bottleneck with regards to any kind of new product or any kind of major partnership that we had. Yeah. So, it was pretty cool. So, what it sounds to me is that you're taking this, you're starting out as a lawyer, you're joining a billion dollar company, Conduit, in Israel. And you get them and you go and you work with huge clients. And that put you in the position where you're in the intersection between the tech and the compliance. And you're getting the exposure, both of the R&D, but also from your background. And so, you're moving yourself to the business. And then, how do you go to product and venture capital from there? So, first there was, I mean, venture capital. So, I moved on to Rhodium from there, which you know also that [--] was part of the team. And Daniel Recanati obviously. I worked on the financials. And so, I moved on to there. I actually got my first leg into VC as a student at IDC, at International School , IDC at Herzliya. Actually working for what was then Cardinal Ventures. It's now VL. So, I worked there actually as a student. At some point, I did like almost 75% of the position while I was doing two degrees. So that's my first picture in the world of VC. And then, when I heard from a friend actually for portfolio company of Rhodium, they were looking for somebody to join the team, the investment team. I was, Okay. This is where I want to go. I had that just hunger to enter that space. I thought it was so interesting. I heard about it from my parents because they were always in tech and just I was like, I need to go down that route. And yeah, I was really fortunate. I think that a lot of what I went through in compliance managing teams, like you said, and working with R&D teams really helped me then when I met with founders at Rhodium. So, Adi, I want you to take me back a little bit and give me the pivotal moments in your upbringing where, because right now you're one of the most popular investors in Israel. And I've been recommended to talk to you on this show from so many people that I can't even count anymore. Thank you. So, I'm curious, one of the things I'm curious about is what helps a person get to where they are today? Is it just their passion? Is it opportunities that they were seizing? Is it a motivation? So, what were some of the pivotal moments that you really became passionate and you knew, I want to devote myself to the work that I'm doing? I think it's a really good question. I mean, it's a lot of the things you've said, right? So first, people who know me know I'm a very passionate person. I get very very excited about things that I believe in, sometimes too much. But I'm very very excited about things I'm passionate about. And I think that passion is something that is contagious. So, I think that helps. When you meet people, they see that you want something and you're interested, I think that's helped. But, in many ways to get to where you want to go, I mean, I say this a lot, I think you really need to be open to meeting people, be open to hearing other people's stories and learn from their stories, what works for you and what doesn't. Like, I've always done my homework before. Every step I took, whether it was, I moved to New York, I had nothing, right? Like, I had nothing. I had family and everything. But in New York, I didn't come with the partner. I had maybe new three people. I didn't have an apartment. I didn't have a job. But I came very structured. And I think everything I've done was always very structured. Like I said, I always thought a few steps ahead. So, like, where do I want to go and how do I get there. And I think, having a structure, and passion and talking to people, and not being, like not being shy. I was almost saying ashamed. But it's not about being ashamed, it's not being shy to reach out to people. I've reached out to partners, really large VC funds in New York. If I move and said, "I'm moving. This is my background." "I'd love to have coffee." And in many cases, it worked. And I really believe that,  I mean, it worked for me then, and I really believe that also today. So, I hope that answers your question. It definitely does. And my follow up question is why venture capital? It sounds like, with your passion and consistency, you can choose any job you want in the world, yet you choose to focus on venture capital. Why do that instead of continuing to another company, or creating your own company? It's a good question. I love venture. I love this job. I love the ability to, and I'm a very curious person. So, I love the fact that I get to meet so many different people and so many different ideas and learn from them. My curiosity is constantly fed on a daily basis, which really intrigues me. And I really love being able to be helpful and be impactful. And I think that that's a lot of what we do. I mean, not every fund does that, every investor does that. But people that know me, I think founders that would know me, I've tried hard to work, I work for them. And I think that at least, that I see it that way. Hopefully that they will agree. But that's how I view it. So, trying to be helpful. And I think that, in the end of the day, the combination of financial business, in the end of the day, we are an asset class like any other in many ways. But being able to bring something that's beneficial and brings money, but also impacts the world hopefully in a positive way makes me feel really good. And that gets me up in the morning. And of course, I think that working for a startup is fantastic. And who knows what  will happen in the future. But in general, I love this job. I think for me also, I love the fact that I see different things. I've had opportunities in the past to join, even I was in New York, to join portfolio companies as a COO and things like that. And I just thought, I'll come in and I'll do this and it'll be great. But after six months, I think I'll be like, Okay, what's next? Not because it's not interesting, but I do like touching different things at once. That's just me personally. That's so so cool. Okay. So, now, talking about journeys and I'd love to talk about one of the things that you're really passionate about, diversity in tech. And I think, on one hand, it's a subject that has been spoken about more and more in our domain. On the other hand, it's definitely not spoken about enough. And not enough has been done to bring that to level the playing field. And, as a mother and as an ambitious career woman, I'd love to hear your take on where are we at today, and what do you think needs to happen in order to level the playing field much more than what has been done today? So fantastic question. So, I think there is a shift, but it's a little bit, I mean, it's slow, right? I mean, my point of view has been for a while is that, if we don't, I mean, there's some people that focus on the top down approach. Okay? Which is we need to start from schools. We need to start educating. We need to start, even in the form of removing biases. There's this known, I forgot what type of bias it's called, I think it's the acceptance bias, if not mistaken, I don't remember. But, you're not going to think about a doctor versus being a female unless you see many female doctors. Right? There's something about having that vision in front of you that helps children at the end of the day, I think that they can be the next founder, the next CEO, the next astronaut, etc. So, some people focus on that. And I think that's really really important. I really believe that in our world it needs to come top down. And I'm not the only one that thinks this, but I've wrote a few post about it. And I think that, if the problem is that we don't have enough people at the top that trickle down and say, Okay.  Either I'm a CEO of a Fortune 500, or I'm a wealthy individual, or whatever it may be, I have the opportunity to be impactful and be helpful. But do I actually do anything to bring more women to sit next to me? And that's just, it's not enough. And I think it's shifting. But from my mind, it's like I, just as an example, I started, it's not even a very very organized process. But I started something within, there's some female investors in Israel, a few funds. They started this VC group of women in VC. And there were 40 something of us. And said, there's so many pitch events all the time. Yeah, it's a lot. I think you're more than 40 now. I think there's near 50. Which is fantastic. So that, in and of itself, shows that there is a shift. But hold on. That I think is great. And because I notice that we have such amazing power in this platform, let's go and just do pitch events, or office hours as some places call it, for female founders. And we've been doing it for a few months now and it's been fantastic. But the reason why I'm so excited about it is a few things. I think that it's really important that more female VCs make decisions. Because if we're not making the decisions and we're not part of the investment committee, and we're not part of the actual decisions and check writing, we're not going to get to that place of being a partner, and then maybe later in the day becoming an LP ourselves or angel investor, etc. So, that's in one hand from the VC side. And then obviously, helping the founders, female founders who statistically we know they have a harder time raising money, have a better opportunity from women that they usually don't meet at the table. So, both sides of that, I think, it's really crucial. But it really needs to come from the top. We need more LPs that are women. We need more CEOs to be women. We just need more people that have capital and access, and the ability to make decisions to start making it for women. And not just women, by the way. Any diversity. Whether it's in Israel, I would say Arabs and Ethiopians and whatever it may be. People with disabilities, it doesn't matter. 100%. 100%. One of the things that I've been contemplating, here in California, being in the midst of the Black Lives Matter movement, one of the things that, and the movement is talking all about, not the fact that the black lives matter, everybody knows that. But, it's more specific than that. It's saying that people that are not minority, that have what they call white privilege, we have an innate responsibility not only to not be racist, but to actually take action against it. Right? So, being a bystander is a part of the problem. And I think that what you're saying here top down, and being that as a decision maker, not saying that you promote diversity, but actually taking action and speaking out about that. So, I think that's something that's definitely true. But Adi, I also want to talk about a little bit about investing. So, coming in, I'm having the time of my life with Oded and joining at J-Ventures. And as I'm understanding the world a little bit better, one thing that is very evident is that, different places around the world invest in different ways. And as I get to speak to leaders from different areas in the world, I get to hear about the different mindsets. You have the unique privilege of seeing both the New York side and Tel Aviv side. And I'd love to hear a little bit about your investment thesis and how do you approach opportunities, and what are some of the key questions that you're thinking about? So, just take a little bit of a step back. So, in general, I think capital is a global fund. So, we invest out of Israel, but we also invest in the US and Europe. And before that, I worked for two funds in New York that I mean, one of them was actually global, FinTech Collective has a global point of view. global thesis on investing in FinTech companies. And then Symmetrical Ventures, we invested in companies in the US. So, I've had the opportunity to invest in startups that are located in New York, Atlanta, LA, Silicon Valley, but also here in Tel Aviv. So, that's just in general. So, I think I've been fortunate to really have a perspective on different ecosystems, which I think is really important. Right. What I'll say is this, I think that, and this is not just a plug, I think this is something that's really important about investing Is that the fact that, we are as Flint Capital, we have an opportunity to be here. Right? I'm the only person here in Israel in the investment team. But we have a partner in Boston, I think that you know [--]. So, he comes out here often. Or before covid, he came here often. And the ability to be East Coast and West Coast, to be in different ecosystems and have information from different ecosystems, and being able to see what's happening. Get information, understand the different VCs, understand the different leaders is really really important. And I think that's one thing. I would say that investing here is very different than in the States in a few ways. I mean, I think it's just what funds look for, right? There is, I give you an example. And this is going to be very, I mean, this might not sound weird to you because you said people out of 8200 and the like, so I think that in Israel there is a lot of that, which is also not good when we think about diversity, right? Diversity is not just about male or female. It's that being different in general. So, I think that in Israel, there's a lot of this copy-paste fund sometimes, where you can find very talented individuals that came out of prime minister's office or 8200 or any one of the other, 9900, any one of these fantastic units, and then they have not much experience, very tech based, but they're like, this is what I'm doing. I can't tell you what I'm doing, but I'm raising money. And then the expectation is for me to be like, I'm in. And by the way, many funds will be. Now, I understand because you're very smart technically. And you have so much experience and you can get very far. You can. But I don't think that in the States you will see so much of that in general. Somebody coming out of MIT, or Carnegie Mellon or the like, and being like, now we're going to throw five million dollars because, or I don't know, even if you came out of an elite unit in the US Army, I don't think that it would be the same. Because essentially, as you know and I know I think in the States and I think also funds here know that too, that it's really really important to have the business acumen. To understand positioning. To understand how you're going to sell your company. And I think that that is a bit of a difference. But, from the other hand, the reason why that works in Israel is because it's a small ecosystem. And we know each other. And it's easy to get that, to get the viewpoint and people. Understand that they have the capabilities. And then, I think that what's good now is that good or bad, we can discuss. Some people see it differently. A lot of funds, they have now this network that they provide to the founders. Right. And to help them get to where they get to go, anywhere they need to go. It's different. It's just very very different. But I think that there is more camaraderie. I mean, in New York, I was super impressed. Like, I think I loved it that we were sharing between each other. VCs, super cool. I don't know if it's like that in the Valley. In New York. I don't know, the people that I met, and the funds that I met, investors, we would share information. If I saw something interesting, what do you think about this, what are your thoughts, what are you looking at. It was a lot of sharing for the sake of working together and getting feedback. Especially in the FinTech funds at least. I don't know. But not just. And I think here, that's happening, too. But it depends, again, which sectors. Some of them are more like, let's keep it in stealth mode and not really share. So, I think those are the differences. And I think it's really important for founders when they think about, always think of, like I said before, thinking few steps ahead. So, when you get your seed investor, I would always think about, I think a pre-seed, but think about who you want to be around the table for your A and how to get there. And I think, that's really important. I think that one of the things that you mentioned so resonated with me. Because I spent four and a half years in one of those units in the IDF. And then I came here to Stanford to continue my studies and continue enriching my own knowledge, both in engineering, but also in business and scaling products and obviously with J-Ventures. And one of the key distinctions, like you mentioned, is I'm seeing, in the IDF, we're sitting down, we're doing computer science. Really really great advanced technology for many years. And then a lot of my friends go out and they build startups. Here, all of a sudden at Stanford, the first class we have is introduction to deep learning. The second class is how to scale your product. It's constantly intertwined. What often we find, though, is that, and I've talked to quite a few professors here and they mentioned that oftentimes a Technion graduate, or a graduate of the unit, has more skills than a Stanford or MIT graduate, which is interesting. But obviously leads to, No. No. Of course. I mean, that's why it does work. I think that what we get in the army is you can't get that in many other places for sure. But it's, I think you'll agree with me, it's not the same as exactly as working in a company and growing within and doing an internship at somewhere in the States. I think the best thing to be able to do this is some crazy idea. I had one, so that we could get Israelis the opportunity. Israelis out of the army, the opportunity to work for two years, at a ray of fortune 100 companies as a tech job for two years, learn what it's like to be in these companies and they can decide if they want to stay or they want to go and build their own thing. But get that network, get that knowledge and get the expertise what it's like to work in corporate America. Because that will be so beneficial for their next cyber company or whatever company they'll do. That sounds amazing. Adi, I can't believe we're almost at 20 minutes. And I have to spend the last few minutes understanding you a little bit better. And I'd love to ask simply a difficult question. What are you passionate about? Why do you wake up every morning and look at deals and do the work that you do? What are you really passionate about right now? So, I mean, there is the what we do in the fund, right? I mean, we invest and we look at companies that are data driven. Any company that has some form of cognitive technology. I'm going to drop the buzzwords, but there is a meaning behind it. So, we do like companies that are AI-based, NLP, whatever it will be in the world of cognitive tech. But why is that interesting? We really believe, and I myself as well, the ability to use technology, as you know very well, to make our lives better. To make our lives easier. To make certain processes that we didn't think about exist. Or to take processes that didn't work and just make them work better and well. And obviously have a business around it. I personally, obviously am excited about those businesses that also have some benefit to humanity as well. And it doesn't need to be impact. Right? Like if you're a company that obviously, you're helping me with continue to work at the office in a very easy, secure way, okay, that also does good for me. But like, for example, what I liked about FinTech specifically is that, and I still do, is that there really is a way to invest in a company that is financially focused, that wants to work within the world of finance. But you're helping the underbanked the unbanked, emerging markets. You're doing things that you didn't think you were necessarily doing and you're making an impact even think you actually were. So, to me, that's always very very interesting and important. And I think that what gets me up in the morning, like I said, is just being able to be a part of that. To be able to meet these individuals. There's that moment when you meet that entrepreneur with a female mentor, and you're like, holy, wow, this is just the right team, I have to invest in this. I mean, there's a company right now that I'm looking at that I hope we close the deal. I can't give too much information, obviously, but they're focusing on such a big, important market that touches each and every one of us. And the technology's super strong. But I mean, when I will share it with you, hopefully, and we do hopefully invest, you're going to hear about it and be like, wow, like this is so, it seems so simple, but it's so important. And it's so different. And when you meet something like that, where it's a big, big market and really, really pain. And it's not just a pain to a few people, it's a pain to all of us, like in our hearts. I think that it's like you just want to invest. You want to be a part of that journey and be helpful. And yeah, what gets me up also in the morning, is my baby. I love that. I love both answers. And those deals are rare, right? I mean, it's not every day that you meet a team like this. And I'm a good friends with Dror Berman from Innovation Endeavors. And every time I go to their offices and I look at their board of investments and I asked Dror, like, "What are you excited about?" And he shares with me a deal, and then to the outsider, it seems that yeah, there is all these amazing amazing deals that come all the time. But it's not true. And I'm seeing it at J-Ventures. It's hard to find those deals. They're very rare. They're very competitive. But at the end, being a partner on a company that makes a good impact on the world, on a product that scales and touches people's lives, that's what I'm on my journey hopefully to do one day. You're doing it. Hippo was a great example. I mean, Hippo is, yes, it's insurance, but you're helping people have a better security in their lives. And Assaf Wand is just the best ever. That's a company I wanted to invest in. Sitting here, one of the things that I love about covid, and I hope he watches this because he's helping sponsor the show, is that I get to sit next to him in an empty office of 200 people, and I just get to watch him work. And while I'm coding away the product, I'm just listening in. By the way, he's one of the people, I met him, when he was raising, I think, his seed in New York. He came to FinTech Collective, and I've told him this, everything he said he would do, he's basically done. So, hats down to him. Adi, three words that you would use to describe yourself because you already have a meeting with your female VC colleague. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Three words to describe myself. Passionate. Yes Loyal. Okay. Energetic, I guess. I love it. I love it. Passionate, loyal and energetic. Adi, toda raba. Thank you very very much. Toda to you. Thank you so much. You're doing such a great job. And I'm looking forward to maintaining this relationship and continuing to learn over the years. Thank you. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye.
