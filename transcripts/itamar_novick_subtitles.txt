We got it right. Wonderful. Itamar Novick,  thank you so much for being on the show. I really appreciate your time. Michael, thanks for having me. I'm super excited to be here. I am so excited to learn over these next 20 minute what it means to scale businesses, to raise venture capital. You've raised over $270 million yourself of venture capital funds, besides being an early stage investor through Recursive Ventures and being a venture partner of UpWest and Jay Ventures. And I if I begin to say everything that you've done, I'm not gonna end there. Itamar, give me a brief rundown of who you are. What are you passionate about? And let's move from there. Absolutely. Thanks for asking. So, I'm an operating investor, which means that I have a day job during the day and that is the Chief Business Officer at Life360. A company I helped take public last year in the Australian Stock Exchange for a valuation of over 600 US million dollars. And at night and on weekends, I'm at Recursive Ventures, which is a seed fund that I've raised myself. And I've been investing in startup companies at the pre-seeds stage of the last eight or nine years. Incredible. Okay. Hold on, what is chief business officer? I know what a chief executive officer, or chief financial officer. What is the chief business officer? So, I think it's a little bit up for interpretation. Different companies use that title sparingly for different things, specifically for Life360. Being a consumer business, being a seed business, I'm really the person that manages most of the business development opportunities with different partners. Creating an ecosystem of partners and other parties that want to engage with us. And also, doing what's called corporate development, which is mostly M&A. And that's us acquiring potentially smaller companies and expand our product line or help with our talents in the company. Incredible. So, you're moonlighting as the precedent seed investor, yet you're running, you're helping formulate business propositions and M&As for companies that go public like Life360. Is there a dissonance between the two? Is there what? Sorry. A dissonance. A clear distinction. Because it sounds like two different worlds. Yeah, it's true. Actually, I do a little context switching. But, really the underlying thread that connects it all is I just love helping entrepreneurs, right? So, I found early on in my career that I'm okay as a CEO. I can run the company, but I'm actually better at supporting CEOs. Supporting entrepreneurs running companies. So, really, when it comes to when you think about value creation and entrepreneurship and VC, back scalable startups, often at some point you'd either think about fund raising, right? To basically accelerate scaling up the business. Or you'd think about potentially acquiring other companies that can help you do that even faster just getting the business. Or you'd think about going public or selling your company. And those are places where I think if you got a lot of collective experience across different pieces that add up to the startup ecosystem. Whether it's product marketing, technology and of course, adding finance on top of that. You can really add a lot of value when you've got this positive view of of things. And that's really what I bring to the table. Because of my background being engineering product, hands-on operations, business development, and also funding and finance. Okay. So, if you had to guess, how many entrepreneurs have you helped over the years? Honestly, probably hundreds. By the way, I have a rule which I'd like to share with you and the audience. Whenever I engage with entrepreneurs, I just have so much sympathy for what they're going through. Because I've done it myself. And I just try to find a way to help. Even if it's one small thing I make promise to the public that I talk with. If you're spending your time with me, you're very valuable. That I find at least one way to help you and hopefully more. But, you can't be with every entrepreneur. I mean, your time is incredibly valuable, incredibly scarce. So, how do you choose who do you work with and who do you not work with? That's a great question. So, unfortunately, like other VCs, I do have to filter out so I can focus on what I think are opportunities that have the highest propensity or biggest chances to make an impact on me as an investor. And of course, on the founders and on society, right? So, I've got to pick and choose which battles I want to fight. And I do that using the skills that I've learned as an institutional VC from some of the best in the business when they're working more in their ventures. I learn how they evaluate opportunities and I try to focus my time on what I believe is the best way. With that said, I think in this business, in venture capital, you really have to create value for people around you in your network. You've got to make an impact also for your companies. So, I try to do the best that I can and free up as much time as I can. Match to free up, to really help people in my network. Of course. Okay. So, hundreds of entrepreneurs that you've helped. Are there more similarities or differences that you've seen? Because then obviously everybody's crazy. That's like the number one similarity. But more tangibly, are there more differences or similarities? It's funny that you say most entrepreneurs are crazy. I actually think the best entrepreneurs are amazing in mitigating risk. Because startups are so risky to begin with. That really a lot of good founders, what they know how to do well, is like, Okay, we've got those 10 different risk vectors in our business. How do we reduce it down to one? Right? Because startups are so risky. So, I think I've seen a lot of different entrepreneurs and they also invest in entrepreneurs out here in the Bay Area. And entrepreneurs across the US with some focus on Israeli entrepreneurs. Probably 30, 35%. My portfolio is what I call Israeli companies which typically means that they've been started by an Israeli entrepreneur here in the U.S.. Is there a specific reason for that by the way? Why that focus? Well, first of all, I'm Israeli. And I moved to the states a little bit over 10 years ago. So, naturally, culturally, it's easier for me to relate to Israelis, right? And also because I believe in the Israeli startup ecosystem. I think we're just getting started, right? With Israelis back in Israel doing amazing work across different fields, machine learning, cybersecurity, so on and so forth. There's so much more opportunities back in our holy land. That's one. And second thing, I've seen and I've worked with so many successful, resourceful, creative, amazing entrepreneurs. Israelis moved here in the US. So, I think it's actually an advantage that I'm pretty easily able to tap into Israeli entrepreneurs and help them scale their companies. Incredible. And I mean, you are very active with both UpWest Labs and J-Ventures. And I'm probably missing a bunch others that are very involved with the Israeli or Jewish ecosystem. So, that definitely shows. Scaling a startup. You mentioned that a lot of entrepreneurs are saying that they're able to mitigate the risk or the various risks that they have. But at the end of the day, like 99.99% of startups fail. So, what do you see that you're seeing a lot of early stage entrepreneurs coming in before even a pre-seed or a seed? I mean, most of them are gonna fail. What is the distinction that you see? What are the common themes of those that end up able to raise that capital that gets them to where they need to get to or don't? That's a great question. So, there's no science here, right? There is directional thinking on what me personally and other folks in the industry believe that works. So, I think in the early stages, there's three things that I really wanna focus on, which is the quality of the team and how fit is that team to solve this specific problem. TAM, total addressable market. Which is a huge deal for VCs. And it should be a huge deal for entrepreneurs as well, because you don't wanna go after a small opportunity that's not necessarily VC scalable and trying to win that way with all you can. So TAM is I think a really important one that entrepreneurs sometimes miss and should pay more attention to. And the last I would say, which is not always easy for investors to speak up and talk about that is why they call Fundability. So, you know how you sometimes it's really hard to turn down source reactions. There's something there, right? If you wanna succeed in the VC start up game, you've gotta be fundable. And on top of all the other things that I think about when I think about investing in pre-seen and seed companies, I really do have to take into account whether this people, this company, this story would be able to scale to more and more investors that would put bigger checks into the company's scale. So, what you're saying is that as an early stage investor, you're looking at a company that you're not just saying, is this company able to use my money wisely to get to a product or to get to their first customers? But are they able to then use that momentum and raise their series A, their series B from institutional investors? And which is one of the biggest tests, right, for startups. Are they're able to get past that big first institutional funding and propel that growth? And I think having that funding and having better and smarter people are on the table to help you as an entrepreneur. Scale your startup is extremely important. Which is why, also for me, as a VC, I believe that's where VCs can add most value. Make sure that your companies are well funded. That's probably the single thing that VCs can do to help their entrepreneurs most. Of course, there's many other things. But that would be the first. Yeah, I just had a fascinating conversation with also somebody from J-Ventures who's really well known for crisis management and coming into companies who need help when they're not able to necessarily raise another round and maximize the value of their assets. And one of the things that he mentioned is that the real value that the board members and the VCs can provide is grounding the founders and making sure that they understand in the high level of what they need to do, what how much funding they need, how do they raise that funding and make sure that their product, that their company lives on. What's happening today in terms of raising money? Because as a young entrepreneur, it's very confusing. A lot of people are saying, only raise how much you really need. Save the equity. Focus on the business. Don't focus on your ego. A lot of others are saying, raise as much as you can because we don't know what's happening tomorrow. There might to be such a thing as covid-19 and you're not gonna be able to raise that funding from March until May. So, where are you on the spectrum of thought? I'm very entrepreneurial friendly. So, I'd probably say, raise as much as you can, but not too much. Okay. So, explain that. I think having more capital to work with and basically enabling you to have more room for mistakes. And a lot of startups, I mean, startups are really this journey inside the founder and the founding teams have. Like, how quickly do you understand how to position your market, your product. How to brand and sell and operate and scale your business. And it's really that journey where you have to learn all those things is the more that you do it, the more value create, the faster you create that value. So, having more capital enables you to potentially accelerate that journey. And that's, of course, is extremely important. But on the other hand, having too much capital and we've seen some of this with some of the Softbank vision funds, where we've seen the situations of over capitalization that basically leads to mistakes, right? Because it's easy to solve problems with money. But often that is not the right solution for problems. Often maybe you have the wrong team members. Or you've got the wrong business model. Or maybe you've got the wrong go-to market, right? And pouring more money on that problem actually doesn't fix it and masks the real underlying issue. So, raise as much money as you can to give you as many bullets in that gun to shoot and aim and try to hit your target. But not too much that you can become undisciplined. I think that's fascinating. This idea that money can solve a lot of problems, especially early on. And it's almost blind the organization into thinking into masking some of the real underlying problems, because at the end, you wanna be lean, you wanna be efficient, you wanna maximize your product and not just use money to, let's say I wanna get to a million views on this show. I can pay a million dollars for advertising to get a million viewers. But it doesn't necessarily mean that my product is good or that I'm doing something useful. That's not a business. You actually lost money. That's not good business. That's definitely not good business. But if I'm able to do this with a $100 then we know that there's something here that with a million dollars, I can actually scale this in a very healthy way. Right. When you think about it, a lot of VCs these days they're really focused on scaling up. It means that there is already some level of product market and maybe it's really good. And right you need the majority of capital is when you're really scaling up. Going from five salespeople to 50 salespeople. That requires investment ahead of time. If you really hire those people. Train them, make them effective, right? If you're early on the first innings of coming up with your company. Whether it's a B2C or a B2B company, I'd actually say it's not about the money. It's about really coming up with your thesis, having an MVP, getting out there testing stuff. You don't need 100 people and tens of thousands of dollars to be able to do that. To get that motivation. Sure. So, I mean, you've seen quite a few entrepreneurs go in and scale their product or scale their business from five salespeople to 50 salespeople. Well, what are the factors that are gonna make or break you? Or what do I need to keep in mind later on? This is a very selfish advice that I'm asking for now. What do I need to keep in mind as young entrepreneur as I will attempt to scale my business from five customers to 50 customers? That's a very interesting question. So, I've got a little bit of a theory that I've developed over the years, and that is what got you here is not necessarily what's gonna get you there. And more specifically, with startups, what happens is that the culture shifts a lot in the early stages, right? So, early on it's like two gals and a dog. Right? Sitting in some basement maybe. And they're trying to come up with something and come up with a business plan. And that scales all the way to five, 10, 20 people. But, once you get to forward is like, managers and people reporting to them, let's say a 20 to 30 people range, something breaks, something changes with the culture. The lines of communication become longer and more complicated in seeking and getting alignment within the team takes more energy. And that's fine. So, that's that breaking point. There's another breaking point, somewhere between those 50 to 80 employee range where, again, you've got even longer lines of communication. Things are more complicated. Some you have 20 people meetings where everybody else is not there has to say, "Yeah, this is awesome." And then you can get going. So, that's another breaking point. And there's typically another one of the 120 to 150 employee range. And then you're like a big company. You've got other company problems. So, one of the things that entrepreneurs and even investors sometimes fail to recognize is that the same set of people that they've actually gotten from, like 10 employees, zero employees to 20. I think these are gonna be the people that get you from 20 to 60. It requires a different type of leadership. And you have to, first of all, on yourself as an entrepreneur and on your team and who's really the best person for the job at those different stages. And that's something that's not always easy for entrepreneurs to do as the business scales up. I mean, I've heard of this quite a few times. There are there are some points and I believe me, Micha Kaufman from Fiverr, he gave an inspiring talk on one of the conferences I attended. And he mentioned that at every junction of Fiverr, he kept asking himself, "Am I still the right CEO to grow this company?" Now that we're hundreds of thousands of employees. This is a different company than when we were a couple of friends in a garage and just starting out. And it sounds like it's almost an impossible ask to go to an entrepreneur or a founder and say, "Hey, can you please ask yourself, are you still the right CEO to run this?" "And if not, can you please be honest and go to the side and let somebody else lead us?" And Micha is amazing. I love Micha. He's one of those people that, it's like it's the investors dream of somebody who can start by himself and then manage a thousand people after an IPO, right? There's people like that, but it's not everybody. And you have to really reflect on yourself and understand. I mean, even for me, it was a journey. When I was younger, I was like, "Yeah, I'll be CEO and I'll be the best CEO ever." And you know? That's not actually true. Over time, you learn what you're good at. And I'm really good at supporting entrepreneurs first than being an entrepreneur myself. So, I think that kind of self reflection can really go a long way for entrepreneurs. Incredible. Itamar, what are you passionate about? What industries? What type of entrepreneur? What's it really gets you out of bed in the morning? So, I'm actually more of a generalist. To be honest with you, I do have specific areas and things that I focus on. I invest in consumer technologies. but not like e-commerce and media, more services on the consumer side. I invest in data and machine learning tools and capabilities all the way across the stack from infrastructure, deploying, developing different types of data and machine learning services to actually service in financial services and real estate and other verticals where you can use data to disrupt antiquated businesses. And then I also do a little bit of emerging tech, right? Where I've tap them in stuff like mobility, for example, IOT and other areas. And it's interesting because when I look at my track record of success rate, my biggest wins as an investor, Life360 IPO, credible IPO, RING sold to Amazon for over a billion dollars, right? Automatic sold to SiriusXM. When I think about some of those opportunities, They weren't thesis driven. I recognize a strong entrepreneur pursuing a great opportunity and learn and adopted in the process of engaging with them and build my thesis on the go when I did that. That's worked really well for me. Right. That's inspiring. Itamar, one thing I have to ask. Entrepreneurship, a lot of times as a founder, it seems you get a lot of nose. You get a lot of suspicion. You get a lot of rejections, right? For every 99 VCs that say, "No." Or, for every one VCs that says, "Yes." You might get 99 that's say, "No." How can founders get to be really open to really important advice, or be mindful of this advice when they're constantly hearing rejections and No's. How can entrepreneurs filter out the good and the bad and really take in the important stuff? Yeah, I think that's a great question. And when I think about CEOs and start companies, tech startup companies, they have two jobs that matter most to me: one is fund raising and the other one is creating a vision for the company that aligns everybody, every stakeholder in the company. Those are the two most important things. And I think if you're not really, if you're not the right person to raise capital from investors, then I think in the early stages you probably shouldn't be the CEO, right? Because that's something that the CEO is expected to do. Like your team is coming in. So, it's a little bit saliency, to be honest with you. Like, you have to reach out to all people. It's a process like a sales process, right? It's a partnership custom. You're looking for a funding partner for you on this journey. And getting no's is really important. And learning from those no's actually getting valuable feedback, finding ways to get valuable feedback, finding ways to keep engaging with someone, with investors. Who knows, maybe it hasn't worked this time around, but it will work next time around, right? That could be great. And elegantly being able to build your investors network, even through those no's is actually pretty critical for a startup CEO. One way that I always chat about with my entrepreneurs is, often VCs would give you very vague answers and why they chose not to invest in your company. And I think your goal as an entrepreneur is to try to get to the bottom of what's happening, even if it's not something that's comfortable for you to hear, right? One of the best ways of doing that is really [--] and starting back to those VCs to the people that introduced you to them and trying to understand if you can get some more information there. Another good way that I sometimes recommend is, it's actually pretty good if you've got two founders in the meeting with VCs where one, the CEO is just talking because they're the ones that really meeting. But another one could be in the background. So, the more taking notes and just looking at people's reaction. I love that. Like,  what resonates? What doesn't resonate? It's really a different mindset because you're not pitching. You're there to really read the reactions in the room. And I've seen that being successful as well. I love that so much. Itamar, right before we leave, I can't believe 20 minutes are almost over. This always go by way too fast. I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. Can I use three words in one emotion? 100% Okay. So, I Helping Entrepreneurs. I love it. I love it. And when you send me that emoji through the e-mail, it even looked better, but it was much cuter when you did it in person. So, thank you. Love helping entrepreneurs. I look forward to reaching out as an entrepreneur myself to get some really important advice and sending you my slidecks. So, I just love that we're forming this relationship. And thank you for all the inspiring work that you're teaching me through a J-Ventures. And thank you for being so generous with your time here. Absolutely. Thanks for doing this great initiative. I'm really excited about what you're doing. Red leaders all around. And thanks for having me, Michael. Thank you very much. Toda raba. Stay safe out there.
