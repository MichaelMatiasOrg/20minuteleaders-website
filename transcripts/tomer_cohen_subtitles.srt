149
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,280
Tomer Cohen, thank you for joining me

150
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,120
on 20 Minute Leaders.

151
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,120
How are you?

152
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,920
I'm great.

153
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,800
How are you, Michael?

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,640
Fantastic.

155
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
So, you're calling me from Be'er Sheva

156
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,920
next to Ben-Gurion University.

157
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,720
And while you're finishing your undergraduate degree,

158
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,600
it doesn't do justice that title

159
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,920
to what you are actually been doing

160
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,680
in Israel with Tech2Peace

161
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,680
and dealing with one of the most extraordinary

162
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,200
conflicts in history.

163
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Actually, a five thousand year conflict

164
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,680
and making it very relevant to 2020,

165
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,720
bringing technology and peace

166
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,840
into the same equation.

167
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,880
And I am very excited to spend the next

168
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,000
20 minutes or so talking to you about this conflict

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,720
but specifically in the context

170
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,880
of how can we leverage technology

171
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,160
and commonalities and similarities

172
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,280
to bridge some deeper rooted conflict.

173
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,200
So, Tomer, take us away.

174
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,280
Tell me a little bit about yourself

175
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,280
and what is Tech2Peace?

176
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,240
So basically, my name is Tomer Cohen.

177
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,840
I'm originally from Jerusalem.

178
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,360
So I'm 27 years old,

179
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
actually about to finish

180
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
my bachelor's degree

181
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,440
in geography and political science.

182
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,600
Nothing to do with technology so far,

183
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,600
even though in the Army I served

184
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,120
as a finder in a special unit.

185
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,160
But actually the combines between I-Tech

186
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,720
the technology and actually combat world.

187
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,320
So it was very

188
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,280
it was the first very strong moment

189
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,760
of the I-tech in my life in general.

190
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,360
In my first year in my bachelor's degree,

191
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,040
I actually established with

192
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,960
two other founders Tech2Peace.

193
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,360
The Tech2Peace, what we basically do

194
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,640
is to connect between young adults

195
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,320
from Palestine and Israel

196
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,960
between ages 20 to 26.

197
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,920
But two things.

198
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,000
The first thing basically is about

199
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,080
learning technology.

200
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,360
Like if it's programming

201
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,760
or mobile AI development

202
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,680
or AI for programmers and et cetera.

203
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,680
Every participant for two week long seminar

204
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,600
actually dedicated a lot of the time

205
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,840
to study this subject

206
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,480
and actually to build

207
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,600
it's own or his own project.

208
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,600
In addition to very intensive

209
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,280
and very unique dialogue workshops.

210
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,920
That actually my partner is Abeer

211
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,520
which is from East Jerusalem

212
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,520
and Uri from Haifa.

213
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,840
We are actually doing it there.

214
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,200
We speak about everything,

215
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,520
about our personal experiences,

216
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,600
about the history like Nakba

217
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,680
and the Yom Ha'atzmaut Independence Day

218
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,560
and all those issues in two week long seminar.

219
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,160
And actually,

220
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,200
because what we're trying to do is

221
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,560
to build new partnerships,

222
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,320
new friendships and partnerships

223
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,840
that can go for the long term.

224
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,440
Amazing.

225
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,040
So just a little bit of context,

226
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,800
because a lot of the viewers are from,

227
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,880
you know, from California,

228
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,720
not everybody is aware of of the of the

229
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,760
deepness and the complexity

230
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,480
of this conflict.

231
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,440
And I won't be able to do justice

232
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,360
in the 10 second brief.

233
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,280
But it essentially talks about

234
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,440
the Middle East conflict,

235
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,800
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

236
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's much more than just territory.

237
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,440
It's more than just culture.

238
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,600
It's about history.

239
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,200
It's about deep-rooted beliefs.

240
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,760
It's about generations of hatred that have

241
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
that have erupted to where we are today

242
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,840
and then unresolved conflicts

243
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,360
that basically the whole world is

244
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,040
trying to help out or not help

245
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,200
in one way or another.

246
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,640
And so, give me a little bit of

247
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,960
what is this problem?

248
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,560
So it's two weeks

249
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,800
where they would come together.

250
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,920
What have you noticed?

251
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,040
And actually, I want to go back to

252
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,840
how it started, because that's a fascinating story

253
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,400
that you started telling me before.

254
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,800
So basically about how it started

255
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,160
and what we basically

256
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,600
actually do every day at Tech2Peace.

257
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,840
So basically two years ago I met

258
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,280
the two other co-founders

259
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,280
Abeer, as I said,

260
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,760
which is from East Jerusalem

261
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,360
and Uri, he's from Haifa originally.

262
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,920
And they actually told me about the work

263
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,640
we actually was running an organization

264
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,960
we called the [--]

265
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,480
Some Israelis maybe know this organization,

266
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,160
but this is another informal organization

267
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,480
which actually combine between Palestinian

268
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,280
like we connect the Palestinians and Israelis.

269
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,920
A full dialogue.

270
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,200
Just to meet, being friends

271
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,000
and actually make, you know,

272
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,840
the most significant connections.

273
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,160
And they did it for almost 10 years.

274
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,200
And like more than 450% in Israel

275
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,840
is actually meant for this program.

276
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,520
[--]

277
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,400
And once I from a moment two years ago,

278
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,280
I was asking them,

279
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,440
"Abeer, Uri, what do you think?

280
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,120
How can we actually create bigger impact?

281
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,440
How can we actually do something?

282
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,840
Yeah, exactly.

283
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,560
How can we actually,

284
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,320
Because it's amazing.

285
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,760
Palestinians and Israelis meet.

286
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,040
But in order to actually try

287
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,320
and do something very significant

288
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,440
with the future of this region,

289
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,120
maybe let's try other methods

290
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,130
And Uri told me that

291
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,400
he  worked for many years.

292
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,280
He's a project manager

293
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,200
in the I-tech industry in Israel.

294
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,160
And I was about just finished

295
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,680
my role in one of the like I think

296
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,560
two Asian companies.

297
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,000
The Israelis actually likes

298
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,160
doing summer camps,

299
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,720
like I-tech in Israel.

300
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,560
And we thought, Okay,

301
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,720
let's maybe try and do something else.

302
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,600
Let's maybe try to do

303
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,040
dialogue seminars like dialogue camps let's say.

304
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,800
We've I-tech in the same time

305
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That actually the participants

306
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,880
will get that vantage to get better future

307
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,760
and some practical over life, basically.

308
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,600
And the reason that we started with this

309
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,800
model, basically, it's because

310
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,080
of two main challenges.

311
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,880
You basically you and the

312
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,760
audience should know about.

313
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,880
First of all, as you can guess,

314
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,800
many of the people who already go

315
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,640
to dialogue, a camp style of seminars

316
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,320
between Palestinian and Israelis,

317
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,600
those are the same convince people.

318
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,520
Yeah.

319
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,840
Yeah.

320
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,200
Like Israelis home mainly from Tel Aviv

321
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,680
and the Palestinians mainly from Ramallah

322
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,840
on the west part of Ramallah.

323
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,640
And some other very specific places.

324
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,520
But most of the people that actually

325
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,120
go and meet, it's the Palestines

326
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,920
And so we thought,

327
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,680
How can we bring new people,

328
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,000
new people from the periphery of Israel,

329
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,640
from the periphery of Palestine,

330
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,120
from refugee camps,

331
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,080
from like Bedouins, from the [--]

332
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,120
How can we bring someone from Ashdod,

333
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,400
from Middle East and Europe and places that

334
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,040
are a bit far from Tel Aviv from the center.

335
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,360
And then we thought about,

336
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,000
let's try and bring them something,

337
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,640
but actually we can use something,

338
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,320
that all the participants

339
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,360
we get out of the benefit of the doubt.

340
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,320
All right.

341
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,480
Basically.

342
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,720
And the second reason

343
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,920
that we established Tech2Peace.

344
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,320
The second challenge which you

345
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,400
wanted to tackle, basically

346
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,760
it was that in many peace camps

347
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,440
and in many other seminars

348
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
we basically many times, not always,

349
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,800
but many times there's no continuity.

350
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,320
Right.

351
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,440
And if the Palestinians and the Israelis

352
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,480
basically act like it's very significant

353
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,840
moments and we became really good friends.

354
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,520
Probably once the seminar is over

355
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,680
or the camp is over,

356
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,680
the Palestinians go to their home.

357
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,760
The Israelis go to their homes

358
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,480
and there is no continuity.

359
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,240
There's no threat.

360
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,040
Is it possible to to create continuity

361
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,480
in a matter of a two week program?

362
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,440
Basically, yes, because we sleep together,

363
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,120
we eat together at night.

364
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,480
We actually shared the most

365
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,920
intimate and the most the

366
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,800
personal stories with one another.

367
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,920
We're having fun with one another.

368
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,720
And in those moments of

369
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,000
after we finish the program

370
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,480
around nine or 10PM

371
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,520
those are the moments

372
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,880
where the friendship actually created.

373
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,240
And this is actually what we're trying

374
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,640
to achieve besides all the

375
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,000
very intense survey reasons.

376
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,360
And this is what we do in the seminars.

377
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,880
But other things that you and the audience

378
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,800
actually should know about Tech2Peace.

379
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,600
That once the seminar is over.

380
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,160
All the participants become

381
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,640
automatically alumni of Tech2Peace.

382
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,480
And they start the alumni program,

383
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,360
which means before the coronaviruses,

384
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,160
they give you like every one or two months

385
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,920
actually meeting with experts,

386
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,160
if it's from Google,

387
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,120
fron Microsoft,

388
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
sometimes from MIT,

389
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,080
from other places.

390
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,240
In order to give them the additional

391
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,120
value of after the seminar.

392
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,040
Yeah.

393
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,680
And sometimes also, of course,

394
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,400
also dialogue to  get in-depth into the issues

395
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,040
that actually talked during the seminar.

396
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,240
And also between the 90 alumni of Tech2Peace

397
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,640
that we have so far,

398
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,600
17 of them actually work

399
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,440
on cross-border startups together.

400
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,320
This just started in a couple of months ago

401
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,080
to work on cross-border startups

402
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,600
with our amazing partners from Boston.

403
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,960
It's got a 50-50 startups.

404
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,960
It's a new startup incubator.

405
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,560
So it's very exciting.

406
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,040
Wow.

407
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,760
So at the end then,

408
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,800
how many people went through this?

409
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,320
How many of these two week programs

410
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,160
have you done so far?

411
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,360
Since the inception of this.

412
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,160
So the first seminar took place in 2018.

413
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,880
In Yeruham, down south

414
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,880
in very isolated small town.

415
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,640
With actually Michael Biton

416
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,720
who is now in the government

417
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,800
[--]

418
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,560
he actually was the mayor of the city,

419
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,640
in a small town,

420
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,720
and he was very  advocated in order

421
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,680
to let us do the seminars in his town.

422
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,080
And after the pilot seminar we were surprised

423
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,200
because no one think

424
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,080
with actually what is the connection

425
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,080
Between I-tech and dialogue?

426
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,720
But afterwards,  it actually it works.

427
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,320
We did other two seminars

428
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,760
in the summer of 2019.

429
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,800
And in this upcoming summit,

430
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,320
we've actually gonna do

431
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,520
two or even three seminars.

432
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,440
And that that's gonna be online I guess. Right?

433
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,800
Basically no.

434
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,280
It's exactly.

435
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,800
As far  as the situation now,

436
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,200
there is a very good chance

437
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,280
that it would work out.

438
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,560
But of course, no promises.

439
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,040
It depends.

440
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Actually, I keep forgetting that I'm here.

441
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,120
I'm here in California

442
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,240
and the situation here

443
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,560
is much different than it is

444
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,760
back in the Middle East.

445
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,480
So I'm very happy to hear that.

446
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,800
So tell me a little bit about you.

447
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,000
So you've had, I guess,

448
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,400
And it's about fifteen people each

449
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,800
for each two week program?

450
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,240
Fairly, 50 Palestinians, 50 Israelis

451
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,480
So you've had about 90 people

452
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,400
go through this thing so far.

453
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,720
Tell me a little bit about what

454
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,360
you've noticed about the the openness

455
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,600
that you're contributing or so,

456
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,000
you know, and I'm especially interested about

457
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,720
the continuation of what do you see

458
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,120
happening after the program

459
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,600
with these participants?

460
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,120
So basically,

461
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,080
we try to  find in terms of applicants

462
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
before the seminars,

463
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,440
before we accept the participants,

464
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,040
we try and find people.

465
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,040
Well, actually, like kind of sense of,

466
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,600
We could be entrepreneurs.

467
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,840
It doesn't have to be about I-tech.

468
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,680
It would be also about social impact stuff.

469
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,440
Of course, it could be also about

470
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,840
the other in the private sector

471
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,000
and also the public.

472
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,000
And also to work in the government one day.

473
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,400
If it's about the past 40 or in Israel,

474
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,560
we look to find the people who actually

475
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,440
want to be leaders one day.

476
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,280
And enough open minded to listen to ideas

477
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,680
and concepts that are

478
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,560
really not used to hear.

479
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,800
Right.

480
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,960
If it's in the West Bank or Israel.

481
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,080
So this is what we tried to find

482
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,040
before the seminars

483
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,720
and after the seminar.

484
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,320
So it really depends.

485
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,200
Those are you know, they're like alumni.

486
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,320
I really want to open start up.

487
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,760
So we actually help them

488
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,320
to get inside on top that.

489
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,840
The partnership with the accelerator,

490
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,920
which we have in [--]

491
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,480
and those were most, you know,

492
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,720
more thinking about getting into the I-tech.

493
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,320
We also nowadays try to find more

494
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,560
solutions, for also for them.

495
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,080
With Microsoft and Cisco

496
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,880
and other companies.

497
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,880
So it really depends about the situation.

498
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,360
Sure.

499
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,440
And now let's go a little bit higher and broader.

500
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,760
So this is now impacting,

501
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,720
you know, a few dozen of people

502
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,280
in dozens of people per summer.

503
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,720
How do you get this to scale?

504
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,640
So then how do you get the two

505
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,760
populations to have meaningful dialogue

506
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,320
and not just in small groups?

507
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,120
So the best and the easy thing for us

508
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,040
is basically to do, to create

509
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,160
more and more seminars.

510
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,360
Like now we do two seminars here.

511
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,880
Hopefully because

512
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,800
the demand can be easier.

513
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,320
We so far, the application is still open.

514
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,880
We got more than 400 applicants for it

515
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,920
and allowing for only 60 spots,

516
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,520
spots for the summer,

517
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,240
90, if we will actually be able to do

518
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,360
in the end free seminars

519
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,240
instead of only two.

520
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,480
And the demand is this.

521
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,960
So we definitely look to do more seminars

522
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,600
a year and in more concepts, for example,

523
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,040
each one of our partners, MIT

524
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,600
So now we're talking about actually

525
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,720
creating short a one week long seminar,

526
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,160
which will focus only about the

527
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,640
mobile app development and dialogue.

528
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,760
And also we talk about like doing another

529
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,760
concept, the four week long seminar

530
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,760
with Google, Google for startups,

531
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,440
with the office in Tel Aviv

532
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,720
of one week long seminar,

533
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,360
which actually focus about

534
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,920
dialogue and about entrepreneurship

535
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,840
to build up actually out to build startups

536
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,720
for those who are actually interested.

537
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,480
And then we can also find other thousands,

538
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,560
I guess, of applicants,

539
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,120
new applicants for the notes.

540
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,640
Now, we try to be candidates Tech2Peace

541
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,640
because, you know,

542
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,160
to take a vacation,

543
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,170
a two-week long vacation,

544
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
It's for many people to be tired

545
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,080
mainly for people who must work all

546
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,480
the year or in the summer vacation.

547
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,400
So.

548
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,920
That was my next question then.

549
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,760
These are everybody.

550
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,160
Everybody is busy and taking out two weeks

551
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,880
to form this dialogue and to be open

552
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,280
and to learn, even to learn new things,

553
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,520
even if it's disconnected

554
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,360
from the Israeli-Palestinian

555
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,160
conflict, is very demanding.

556
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,320
So how do you actually find this this

557
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
balance in this Win-Win situation where

558
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,320
people can balance it with their jobs?

559
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,120
Do you think there's room to do things

560
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,640
like this outside of a context of just

561
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,120
two week seminar, but throughout

562
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,840
the year and throughout the life?

563
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,240
So basically,

564
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,320
basically if I got your question right,

565
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,400
So definitely we can scale it much more.

566
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,960
We can do much more seminars.

567
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,760
We can create new concepts with similar

568
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,960
to our concept, basically, for example.

569
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,600
Now we collaborate with M.I.T. about a

570
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,880
We're hoping a MISTI

571
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,280
It's the internationally Department

572
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,280
of M.I.T. to basically help them

573
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,760
to a implement take the best

574
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,400
model in our place.

575
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,840
And the best location hopefully

576
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,280
going to be South Africa.

577
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,120
It gets dark in Judaism and local youth.

578
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:05,800
Yeah.

579
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,120
So, you know, for me, as the Jewish guy

580
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,800
for me, I just know it once.

581
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,680
It will also spread

582
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,560
a lot of places around the world.

583
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,600
For me, it's amazing example of decoding,

584
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,000
[--]

585
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,320
Yeah.

586
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,400
Even besides our region,

587
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,240
which we hopefully know in few years,

588
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,240
we're going to have Anglet and then after

589
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,840
that, a thousands of alumni,

590
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,840
that will to the government.

591
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,320
So you're you're definitely

592
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,440
seeing this grow and grow at scale.

593
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,680
And what do you see yourself continuing

594
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,160
to be a part of this full time over

595
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,040
the years or or these years of slowly

596
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,000
transitioning out and thinking about

597
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,880
other ventures that you want to do?

598
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
So it really depends.

599
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,960
Because throughout the year,

600
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,640
there are really really really

601
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,440
tough moments you know.

602
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,280
Three days before a seminar.

603
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,400
When we also do not get sometimes

604
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,960
the permits for the Palestinians

605
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
to enter Israel.

606
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:01,800
Wow.

607
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,440
And we don't know if the seminar actually

608
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,480
will take place as planned

609
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,880
with the same participants

610
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,040
or if it's it's about.

611
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,680
Also now with the Corona virus.

612
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,040
Of course, there's other NGO's

613
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,280
the budget today is really

614
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,640
suffering out of it.

615
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,200
So there are very, very intensive

616
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,280
and hard moments throughout the year.

617
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,600
But, you know, for me as a co-founder,

618
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,720
like, it's pretty hard

619
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,120
to fall asleep at night.

620
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,200
But on the other end.

621
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,760
When someone Palestinian or Israeli

622
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,880
in the last day of the seminar come to me,

623
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,280
you know, with the tear under the eye

624
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,120
and actually say to me, you know,

625
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,280
this experience actually changed my life.

626
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,680
This experience was so significant for me.

627
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,600
So it's so amazing.

628
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,160
I never thought that they're going to have

629
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,120
a Palestinian friend and or Palestinian.

630
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,640
I never thought that I gonna

631
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
have an Israeli friend.

632
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,720
Totally.

633
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,280
So those moments of people

634
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,200
and it's out of the topic

635
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,120
but it's a lot for Tech2Peace because

636
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,800
it's very emotional and very connecting.

637
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,280
I think to myself,

638
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,920
I do not wanna be out of it

639
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,840
Never.

640
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,200
But in the very hardly night.

641
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,800
That I cannot fall asleep.

642
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,080
Of course, I was thinking about.

643
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,640
Maybe it's too tough to do

644
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,720
something so, so crazy.

645
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,480
Because in this reality,

646
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,760
it's not something usual

647
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,780
to actually connect between Palestinian and Israelis.

648
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:30,040
In our region of course, it's something,

649
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
you know, in the United States.

650
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,360
So sometimes not nowadays, of course,

651
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,520
but in other times it's easier to bring

652
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,880
people from different backgrounds

653
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,400
in the Middle East with all the suffer,

654
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,800
with both sides, with many.

655
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,560
There are so many victims of both sides.

656
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,360
There's so many suffering,

657
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,960
so much [--]

658
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,800
so just bringing new people to be friends

659
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,440
with people that been never thought

660
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:58,920
they gonna be friends with

661
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,440
and not for only two week long seminars

662
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,160
You know, it's four months

663
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,000
and hopefully years after.

664
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,680
So those moments are the most significant.

665
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,240
This is why I hope to continue doing this.

666
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,120
Yeah.

667
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,400
I think that it's it's amazing because I

668
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,560
think it's very easy from far away to take

669
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,240
for granted this idea of bringing

670
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,760
together people for dialogue.

671
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,800
And, you know,

672
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
it's just peaceful dialogue.

673
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
On friends without the differences.

674
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,560
And I think that it's it's just hard

675
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,200
to grasp this idea that in the region

676
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,160
that where we're at in Israel

677
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,880
and the Middle East in general,

678
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,680
it's not that simple to get a Palestinian

679
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,760
and Israeli in the same room.

680
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,480
It's that simple, even logistically just

681
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,840
passing the borders,

682
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,360
putting aside all the personal differences

683
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,200
and then and the fact that  your

684
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,480
friends are gonna think you're crazy.

685
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,480
Your family's gonna disown you potentiall.

686
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,040
It's a problem.

687
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,640
And I think that being this

688
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,880
catalyst and fostering this annoying

689
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,200
happenings is something

690
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,040
that's really remarkable.

691
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,200
And I I've always said it to my family

692
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,800
and friends that I, unfortunately

693
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,880
have started losing faith.

694
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,680
And in the current system

695
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,880
of how we're trying to solve this.

696
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,240
And my personal

697
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,000
belief is that the only way this will be

698
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,560
solved is if my generation

699
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,120
if our generation can grow up

700
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,240
more open minded,

701
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,240
Visit the world

702
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,560
to talk to each other in a friendly way.

703
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,560
Start putting aside 5000 years

704
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,280
of differences, but focusing on the next

705
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,760
five thousand years

706
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,280
and potentially using technology to help

707
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,320
bridge that gap and the similarities.

708
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,640
I think that would be wonderful.

709
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,600
And first, I can't leave.

710
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,640
20 minutes are almost up

711
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,320
But Tomer, I have know three words

712
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,520
that best describe you.

713
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,600
Well,

714
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,040
it's a challenging to choose

715
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,400
It came by quickly.

716
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,960
Yes.

717
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,520
I would try.

718
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:44,530
Determined.

719
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,320
sometimes too much determined.

720
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:47,330
Honest

721
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,280
I try to be honest

722
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,920
to people as much as possible.

723
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,840
It's also very Israeli feel to

724
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,040
to be in that way.

725
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,480
Yeah.

726
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,480
I have other words,

727
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Multi disciplinary.

728
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,320
Maybe a bit impulsive.

729
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,840
Maybe

730
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,520
I love it.

731
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,760
So I brought four different words.

732
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,800
I hope you were.

733
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,920
Very, very Israeli.

734
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,480
I  asked for three.

735
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,320
You give me four.

736
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,880
That's a plus.

737
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,880
Wonderful.

738
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,520
Tomer, toda raba.

739
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,880
Thank you for the inspiration.

740
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,800
And best of luck with Tech2Peace.

741
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,080
It sounds amazing.

742
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,880
Thank you so much, Michael.

743
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,560
Great.

744
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,920
Bye.
