1
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,320
Stav Erez, thank you for joining me

2
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,760
on my show for the second time.

3
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,000
How are you?

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,600
I'm good.

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,680
Thank you for having me.

6
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,360
Of course. Of course.

7
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,080
Okay. So, just today we have

8
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,560
the huge fires all over California

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,160
so I appreciate you being flexible,

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,920
and hopefully by the time that this airs,

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,400
there will be no more fires.

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,280
But in any case,

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,520
thank you for joining me.

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,120
With pleasure.

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,080
Wonderful. Wonderful.

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,400
Okay. So, I have to start again

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,280
from the fun fact

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,680
because it's so much fun.

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,160
And the first fun fact

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,520
that you told me about

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,760
is the fact that you're able to hold

22
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,560
boiling pots without getting burned.

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,480
How is that possible?

24
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,440
Or with getting burned

25
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,200
but without feeling pain, actually.

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah, I just don't feel it.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,640
So basically, you can say I'm a hero

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,960
and this is my superpower.

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,640
I just I can hold it

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,920
and don't feel anything.

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,320
I will still burn though.

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,240
You will still burn.

33
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,200
You actually showed me before

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,520
that you had some burn marks

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,120
but I have to understand.

36
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,920
Literally you can go and hold

37
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,280
a boiling pot,

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,800
but you're not gonna feel the pain?

39
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,720
Yup.

40
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,280
That's just unbelievable,

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,720
but that's just the first fun fact.

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,680
The second one, which you have

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,400
an interesting story, back from the Army

44
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,360
and you discover by chance

45
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,560
that you're colorblind.

46
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,040
Now I have to understand, first of all,

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,240
how is it possible

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,720
that only at the age of 18 or 19,

49
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,120
you get to a point where you understand

50
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,960
that you're colorblind?

51
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,800
It must not be that severe, right?

52
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,000
So I don't know about severe,

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,280
but I was always told

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,240
that I have really bad taste in clothes.

55
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,240
So, but yeah, in the army,

56
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,400
just like I was in the intelligence force

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,920
and everybody is writing something

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,480
from the board.

59
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,480
I'm like looking to the left, to my right,

60
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,400
I really don't understand

61
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,280
what's happening.

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,320
And then I just realized

63
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,400
that I don't see anything

64
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,520
because I'm colorblind,

65
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,480
which makes sense,

66
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,960
my father is colorblind,

67
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,400
but for females it's pretty rare.

68
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,520
You need both parents.

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,680
Interesting. Okay.

70
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,800
So, you need both parents to be colorblind

71
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,720
for females to be colorblind.

72
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,080
To have the gene at least.

73
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,800
To have that recessive gene

74
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,760
I guess, right?

75
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,840
Unbelievable. Okay.

76
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,920
So Stav, you're an investor

77
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,160
and entrepreneur.

78
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,200
You ran an accelerator.

79
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,840
You're very knowledgeable

80
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,600
about the Israeli ecosystem,

81
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,400
but specifically about

82
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,120
the Jerusalem tech ecosystem,

83
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,360
which I'm especially curious about.

84
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,440
And today you're investing with Labs/02.

85
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,760
So, I'd love to start off

86
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,640
with your journey.

87
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,600
Take me back to the old days

88
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,240
when you are just starting out,

89
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,560
your entrepreneurial experience

90
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,400
in Jerusalem.

91
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,600
How do you make your way?

92
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,880
What are the biggest milestones

93
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,400
towards you becoming an investor

94
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,440
as a part of Labs?

95
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,440
Walk me through that journey.

96
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,240
Sure. So basically,

97
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,200
I consider myself

98
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,520
to be a social entrepreneur.

99
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,040
Back in 2012, I co-founded Siftech

100
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,040
and was the CEO.

101
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,240
It was the first entrepreneurship center

102
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,800
and first accelerator

103
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,320
in greater Jerusalem.

104
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,040
Basically, our mission was to help

105
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,840
young people like us stay in the city

106
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,400
and build companies and startups.

107
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,880
And there were no startups

108
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,960
in the city back then.

109
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,680
So like any pitch,

110
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,120
like what is the pain point?

111
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,440
Like why do you have to create

112
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,400
different mechanisms to have people

113
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
stay in Jerusalem?

114
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,160
I love Jerusalem.

115
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,440
Why would people leave it?

116
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,040
So, I think that the biggest problem

117
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,000
for young people

118
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,840
was basically employment.

119
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,760
And so you can work for the government,

120
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,200
but if you want to do anything else

121
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,080
and if you have an idea

122
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,680
and you want to become an entrepreneur

123
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,280
in Israeli startup nation, right. You basically

124
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,560
would have pack your bags

125
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,520
and move to Tel Aviv

126
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,280
because this was

127
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,960
the only ecosystem in Israel.

128
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,640
And we wanted people

129
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,400
to be able to stay in Jerusalem

130
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,020
although they want

131
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,240
to become entrepreneurs.

132
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,320
And we thought that this is a big,

133
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,040
maybe a major milestone

134
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,640
to develop Jerusalem economy.

135
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,440
So we did that in 2012.

136
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,520
Later on we really, we were

137
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,360
a part of the group

138
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,400
that founded a community

139
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,280
of entrepreneurs in Jerusalem.

140
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,000
I think that the next milestone was JNEXT.

141
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,760
Back then, it was

142
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,960
the prime minister office,

143
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,720
the Jerusalem Development Authority,

144
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,600
and the Jerusalem municipality.

145
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,680
So, I founded the project

146
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,040
to develop Jerusalem economy

147
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,840
through high tech entrepreneurship.

148
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,960
My next stop was at OurCrowd.

149
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay.

150
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,080
To build basically the platform

151
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,240
for value creation.

152
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,160
To connect all the tens of thousands

153
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,880
of accredited investors

154
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,760
to the portfolio companies

155
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,360
for business development purposes,

156
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,520
but not only for also

157
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,960
for deal flow, due diligence,

158
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,520
and stuff like that.

159
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,040
And then I gave birth

160
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,040
the day after we launched the platform.

161
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,320
The day after you launched. Wow.

162
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,120
Yeah. During OurCrowd's summit.

163
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,440
It was on a Thursday,

164
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,560
and I really remember John

165
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,760
telling everybody,

166
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,760
I was the last speaker and like,

167
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,960
You just wait. Maybe we're gonna have

168
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,680
like live birth on stage.

169
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,480
Luckily we didn't.

170
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,680
Only the day after.

171
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,480
Wow. Unbelievable.

172
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,880
And then during my maternity leave,

173
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,840
I realized that basically my dream

174
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,880
is to do venture creation,

175
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,080
to build companies

176
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,920
based on academic institutions, IP.

177
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,160
And then we founded Labs/02.

178
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,720
So, we're an early stage seed fund

179
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,560
and incubator.

180
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,480
And we invest in early stage companies,

181
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,520
but also we do venture creation.

182
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,960
And we have a partnership

183
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,640
with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

184
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,760
And we're working

185
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,480
with professors and doctors

186
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,800
to really try to see

187
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,240
how we can take their technology

188
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,440
and turn it into a company.

189
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,040
Fascinating.

190
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,600
So, I am aware that the default way

191
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,640
of starting a company is

192
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,200
you have a couple of people

193
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,120
who are coming together,

194
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,520
they agree on a problem,

195
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,000
then they think of a solution,

196
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,240
and they go and bring that

197
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,560
and hopefully find a good go to market

198
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,520
and a product market fit.

199
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,720
But what you're saying here is that

200
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,160
with venture creation,

201
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,240
a lot of times you're going

202
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,760
into these academic institutions

203
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,400
and you're taking technology and solutions

204
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,320
that don't necessarily

205
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,200
even have a problem

206
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,560
and you're finding ways to adapt them.

207
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,480
Is that the way that it works?

208
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,240
Basically, yeah.

209
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,240
It's not only that.

210
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,480
It's also like build a team.

211
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,240
So it's everything.

212
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,680
It's really understanding the technology,

213
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,080
trying to think what you can do with it,

214
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,400
and usually you have plenty of ways

215
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,920
of solutions and problems

216
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,600
that it can solve.

217
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,360
Do market research.

218
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,400
Talk a lot with the industry,

219
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,200
and try to understand exactly

220
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,400
which is the biggest problem

221
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,120
that they're solving,

222
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,480
the biggest need.

223
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,960
And then bring in,

224
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,880
along with the professor,

225
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,760
the relevant team.

226
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,600
Usually, by the way,

227
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,360
the professor stays in academics,

228
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,440
not usually, it's always.

229
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,560
He stays in the university.

230
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,960
He becomes an adviser

231
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,000
to ...

232
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,640
Okay. And then

233
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,120
So how is that lifecycle different

234
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,880
than the regular startup?

235
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,440
So, you're helping them

236
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,280
do the market research,

237
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,120
form a team.

238
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,760
And then maybe down the line,

239
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,440
invest, I guess.

240
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,120
Because you're not, it sounds like in the beginning

241
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,480
it's more of a mentorship

242
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,120
type of engagement,

243
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,800
and then it becomes a pre-seed

244
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
and a seed stage investment?

245
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,720
Yes. We're really working with them

246
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,520
for a period of time.

247
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,960
This takes time.

248
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,360
Usually when a company comes

249
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
and they pitch,

250
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,440
so it will take a couple weeks,

251
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,000
couple of months like tops

252
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,080
to decide to invest.

253
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,640
Here, we're talking about a process

254
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,200
that can take up to a year.

255
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,160
But when we're happy with the results,

256
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,440
we're putting in the money

257
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,240
and we can move forward.

258
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,040
So then how do you divide your time

259
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,760
because it sounds like

260
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,640
if you have a few of those ventures

261
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,280
that are almost a year long process

262
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,360
and there's only a finite

263
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,600
amount of time and resources

264
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,200
that Labs/02 can provide,

265
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,960
how do you divide that up?

266
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,320
So, we invest

267
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,080
in around six companies per year.

268
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,400
We won't do more than two

269
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,840
venture creations per year.

270
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,680
Okay. So you're focusing, so the venture creation

271
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,320
is even more exclusive, is even more selective

272
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,360
than the investments.

273
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,800
For sure. It takes time.

274
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,760
We can't really do six

275
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,280
I wish I could. But I really can't.

276
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,240
Right. 100%.

277
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,080
So, one of the things

278
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,200
that we talked about before,

279
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,840
which was really interesting to me,

280
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,480
is this sort of the do's and don'ts

281
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,520
of an early entrepreneur

282
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,880
going to their first investors.

283
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,640
And I'd love to get your take

284
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,160
on your impression

285
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,040
having met so many entrepreneurs

286
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
and so many companies.

287
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,840
What are some of the pitfalls

288
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,440
that you notice

289
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,560
that young entrepreneurs make

290
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,280
as they start their journey and approach

291
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,040
their first institutional funding?

292
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,960
So I actually

293
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,120
have a full lecture about it,

294
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,120
but I'll maybe pick like the best ones.
- I love it.

295
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,280
So, I think that the first one is really

296
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,200
that it's all about

297
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,800
personal connection.

298
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,520
So, a lot of the times entrepreneurs come,

299
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,280
they sit down,

300
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,760
they connect their computer,

301
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,760
and they start to talk.

302
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,280
"So, the problem we're solving

303
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,880
and the solution and"

304
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,680
Guys, wait for a second. Let's talk.

305
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,640
It's like a relationship.

306
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,160
It's not an interview, right?

307
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,560
You need to form a connection

308
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,480
with the person,

309
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,920
because if I'm going to invest,

310
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,040
I'm gonna work very closely with you.

311
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,560
I want to make sure not only

312
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,280
that you know what you're talking about,

313
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,800
that you're tackling a relevant problem,

314
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,240
that your solution is good.

315
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,760
I want to find out, first of all,

316
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
who are you

317
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,040
and are you the kind of person

318
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,560
that I want to work with.

319
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,680
So just start

320
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,800
by getting to know the person,

321
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,480
and maybe it can lead me

322
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,040
to how to really connect

323
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,280
and how to approach.

324
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,320
So a warm introduction, I think,

325
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,600
is always the best way to go.

326
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,480
But I think it's really important to say

327
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,960
that even if you don't,

328
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,760
you can't find a warm introduction,

329
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,800
a cold email is okay.

330
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,360
Just do your research.

331
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,360
So, go and see my interview, for example,

332
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,960
for 20 minutes and just write something

333
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,480
about something specifically I said that,

334
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,840
I don't know, clicked.

335
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,440
Go try and find out

336
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,040
if the investor wrote anything,

337
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,080
he did a TED talk.

338
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,000
Go into his portfolio companies

339
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,160
and see which kind of company

340
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,320
he invests in.

341
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,640
So when you're writing an email,

342
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,560
a cold email, just make sure, by the way that's fine,

343
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,360
but just make sure it's not

344
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,480
the same email you're sending everyone

345
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,440
because if an investor gets an email

346
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,320
that he sees that everyone

347
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,080
got the same email, and it's a cold email,

348
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,520
he's probably going to pass from ...

349
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,320
So this is like a small something

350
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,760
that you can do pretty much right away.

351
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,160
I think that another thing is that

352
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,520
you must be proficient in what you do.

353
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,640
So, I know that a lot of people

354
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,440
are starting with

355
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,200
like a story about themselves

356
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,680
and how they encountered a problem,

357
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,320
but I really don't think

358
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,040
that that's enough just to

359
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,920
that you encountered a problem.

360
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,600
It really needs to be something

361
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,040
that you dealt with, you worked with.

362
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,000
Not just something

363
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,040
that occurred one day,

364
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,160
but something that time

365
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,160
you thought a lot about it.

366
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,000
You're proficient in the field

367
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,080
that you're talking about.

368
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,360
I think that this is super important.

369
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,000
I think that

370
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,200
even for pre-seed and seed investors,

371
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,960
it's very important to do

372
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,360
as much as you can by yourself.

373
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,840
So, by the way it's fine

374
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,720
to come to an investor

375
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,280
with a presentation only,

376
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,280
but also, just with a presentation, just show

377
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,520
that you gave it some thought.

378
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,440
That you did your research

379
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,960
as much research as possible.

380
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,520
If I know more about the subject

381
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,000
than you do,

382
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,960
that's not a good thing.

383
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,080
So, really do as much as possible.

384
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,040
And I understand that not everyone

385
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,480
can really put everything on hold

386
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,120
and now focus solely on their company

387
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,440
and build it from scratch,

388
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,040
and that's okay.

389
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,120
You don't have to get to paying customers.

390
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,800
But as much as you can,

391
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,840
try to do on your own.

392
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,320
But there is something

393
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,120
that speaks to this idea

394
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,000
of being scrappy and bootstrapping

395
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120
and being able to leverage

396
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,640
whatever minimal resources

397
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,880
you have starting out.

398
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,200
And coming with some good foundation,

399
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,840
not necessarily with paying customers.

400
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,240
A lot of times investors

401
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,440
don't even expect to see that

402
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,400
up until the seed or the series-A,

403
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,880
but at least coming with proof

404
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,840
that you as a team can leverage

405
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,120
whatever small resources

406
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,840
a pre-seed investor can provide you,

407
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,880
because those few hundred thousand dollars

408
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,560
or those few million dollars,

409
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,640
they're not gonna be

410
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,040
the deciding factor of whether

411
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,720
you're able to execute well.

412
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,800
They might help you get there,

413
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,280
but at the end, the team,

414
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,480
it's how you leverage

415
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,560
those minimal resources, right?

416
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,080
Exactly.

417
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,200
And we're taking a risk, right.

418
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,440
You're sitting in front of us

419
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,880
and you're selling us a dream.

420
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,680
By the way, I love the job

421
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,560
being an investor,

422
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,600
specifically in the pre-seed seed.

423
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,880
I don't need to start like,

424
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,320
I'm not going to the excel link

425
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,620
Okay. You're ...

426
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,120
I see the ...

427
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,800
I get to see people's dream,

428
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,440
so like, that's the best ... ever, right?

429
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,480
But I'm still taking a risk.

430
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,120
And I do want to see

431
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,520
that you took some risk as well.

432
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,680
So, just try to do as much as possible.

433
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,120
I want to say something else.

434
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,240
Just food for thought.

435
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,280
So I see the relationship,

436
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,960
like I mentioned earlier,

437
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,960
I see it as a two way street.

438
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,880
So, it's not only that you're coming in

439
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,200
and you need to impress me and sell.

440
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,600
I really do think that

441
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,800
what you can do for me,

442
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,840
if you're asking an investor

443
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,760
what he can do for you,

444
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,960
is super valid question.

445
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,880
And I want to see more entrepreneurs

446
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,840
actually ask this.

447
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,920
I want them to understand

448
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,960
that they don't only need money,

449
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,240
they need value

450
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,400
and to choose investors

451
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,040
based on value.

452
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,440
So, I will say I had quote a lot of companies

453
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,960
that I said no to

454
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,520
not because they weren't good,

455
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,680
not because I didn't have

456
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,920
a personal connection,

457
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
just because I thought

458
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,200
that I wasn't right investor.

459
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,880
I didn't think that I can bring

460
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,480
additional extra added value.

461
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,560
That's important.

462
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,320
So, this is just a tip

463
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,800
that when you approach investors,

464
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,640
come with the confidence.

465
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,680
Understand that you're coming

466
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,520
into a marriage

467
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,480
and you're choosing the person

468
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,960
as much as he's choosing you.

469
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,400
Right.

470
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,040
Stav, what is your number one turn off?

471
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,280
That when somebody approaches you

472
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,200
You see a lot of companies.

473
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,920
What is like one thing

474
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,120
that really makes you tick,

475
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,320
and not perhaps just you,

476
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,000
but the average investor?

477
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,120
Maybe arrogance, and probably

478
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,800
the biggest problem, I think,

479
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,640
is lack of diversity.

480
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,560
So, I think that a lot of the time

481
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,480
you can see when it's a group of men only

482
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,120
just because they still haven't recruited

483
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,000
the relevant people,

484
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,520
but this is part of their culture.

485
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,640
Or just because they're men

486
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,720
like men and that's it.

487
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,240
I think that this is, by the way,

488
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,520
I think this is a big problem

489
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,400
for our industry.

490
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,360
The lack of diversity is, for me,

491
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,880
it's a big problem.

492
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,560
No, no, definitely. And this is something

493
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,560
that comes up often in this series.

494
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,040
And a lot of others that I've spoken with,

495
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,080
we've spoke extensively about the role of,

496
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,320
the responsibility of having diversity

497
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,480
from both the investor side,

498
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,800
but also the founder side.

499
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,320
And on the opposite side

500
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,160
of this question of

501
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,960
what makes you tick,

502
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,800
what really makes you excited?

503
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,000
So what quality, or what happens

504
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,160
that makes you really excited

505
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,040
when you meet a new entrepreneur

506
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,440
and you're like,

507
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,080
"Wow, this is somebody

508
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,960
that I might really want to work with"?

509
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,440
So, when they're super super excited

510
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,680
about what they're doing and when

511
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,880
I really love crazy ideas, basically.

512
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,720
So the crazier, the better

513
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,560
from my perspective.

514
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,080
But really when you see like this,

515
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,520
I don't know,

516
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,080
this professor from the university,

517
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,840
and he's coming.

518
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,200
And he's talking to you about

519
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,640
like quantum physics.

520
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,240
And he's super excited, and he's sure

521
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,640
that this is the most exciting topic

522
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,640
in the world.

523
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,640
I'm excited as well.

524
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,640
I love it. I love it.

525
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,440
I remember I had a great conversation

526
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,280
with Dror Berman

527
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,560
from Innovation Endeavors a while back.

528
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,280
And their whole thesis is moonshot ideas.

529
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,600
And I was just so inspired

530
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,200
by this notion of investing

531
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,600
based on the idea that

532
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,720
you're only going to go for the companies

533
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,640
that have a shot at changing the world

534
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,400
in a really substantial way.

535
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,320
So I love this idea

536
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,400
of the crazier the better.

537
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,200
But Stav, you gave a tip

538
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,840
that for anybody

539
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,200
who wants to approach Labs/02

540
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,520
should should get to know you better.

541
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,080
So, I'd love to get

542
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,320
to know you better myself.

543
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,480
Hopefully one day I'll also come

544
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,200
and pitch a company to you.

545
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,760
But talk to me a little bit

546
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,960
about what you're passionate about.

547
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,560
So, you see all these different companies,

548
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,880
all the different industries,

549
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,400
what really makes you excited

550
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,040
about the entrepreneurship world,

551
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,640
and what types of projects

552
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,150
do you really get excited about?

553
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,160
So I have to say that

554
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,440
we're pretty generalists.

555
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,360
So, we're excited about a lot of things,

556
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,040
but we are looking to solve big problems.

557
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,920
You called it shooting to the moon

558
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,160
and I actually I love it.

559
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,960
So, it's really hard for me

560
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,760
to pick a specific sector,

561
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,640
but I think what gets me excited

562
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,840
if it's like big ideas

563
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,600
that are going to change the world.

564
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,080
I love the fact that in each one

565
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,760
of my portfolio companies,

566
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,560
I can really see the impact.

567
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,000
We're not impact investors.

568
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,240
This is not what we base

569
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,040
our decision upon,

570
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,880
but still, like if you go through

571
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,400
my portfolio company,

572
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,920
you can actually see

573
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,960
like the how they're going to affect

574
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,600
and change something in the world

575
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,960
each and every one of them.

576
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,720
So, on my personal level,

577
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,240
this gets me excited.

578
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,040
So, I love the fact that people

579
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,830
are thinking like beyond-

580
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,520
Okay. So, you were telling me

581
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,960
a little bit about the portfolio.

582
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,080
I missed it a little bit.

583
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,040
So, just go back and we'll figure out

584
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,640
how to stitch it together properly.

585
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,760
Okay. So, we are pretty much generalists.

586
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,000
So, there's not like one sector

587
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,720
that I could tell

588
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,040
that this is our sweet spot,

589
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,680
although I'm super excited

590
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,080
about NeuroTech.

591
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,520
I think that this is the future.

592
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,360
But I think that we're excited about people

593
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,000
that are coming

594
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,840
that are trying to solve big problems,

595
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,840
that are coming with futuristic ideas,

596
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,440
and, on a personal note,

597
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,600
I love the fact that

598
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,800
if you look at my portfolio,

599
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,520
you can find the impact

600
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,020
that each and every company does.

601
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,200
So, take me back

602
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,240
to the portfolio companies.

603
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,080
You're agnostic.

604
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,640
You're generalists.

605
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,360
This time I'm gonna hear you.

606
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,000
Okay. So, we're pretty generalist.

607
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,240
We're looking for people

608
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,680
that are solving big problems,

609
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:04,080
futuristic, with deep technology.

610
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,280
But on a personal note,

611
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,080
I really like companies

612
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,560
that have an impact.

613
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,040
We're not an impact fund,

614
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,640
but I love the fact that if you look

615
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,200
at our portfolio companies,

616
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
you'll see that each one of them

617
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,720
really is making an impact.

618
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,640
And a sector I would say

619
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,920
that my new passion is maybe NeuroTech.

620
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,120
So, I love that.

621
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,160
Okay. What do you love about that?

622
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,560
Why specifically that?

623
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,320
I think basically we're gonna see,
I think that this is a field

624
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,920
that it's only in the beginning,

625
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,240
and I think that's we're gonna see

626
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,600
much more.

627
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,600
We know very little about our brain,

628
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,040
so we have a lot more to explore.

629
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,200
And I love the fact that until today,

630
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,040
I think that most of the companies

631
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,800
that we saw was very,

632
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,880
you had to put something on your head.

633
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,760
Not to say, in your head.

634
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,440
And we're now going to a phase

635
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,160
where it's going to be

636
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,760
non-invasive completely.

637
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,160
So, you're going to be able

638
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,520
to just make your brain work better

639
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,040
without really hurting him.

640
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,520
So, that's interesting.

641
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,280
I love it. Okay.

642
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,160
So, along the same lines

643
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,660
of getting to know you, I have to ask you

644
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,680
the most important question

645
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,480
which is three words that you would use

646
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,440
to describe yourself

647
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,880
and why those three specific words?

648
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,200
Okay. So I would say I'm an entrepreneur.

649
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,960
I really like to build things.

650
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,560
I have to say that I don't really like

651
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,040
to manage them afterwards,

652
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,280
but I like to build things.

653
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,000
But that is why being an investor

654
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,200
really suits me.

655
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,480
Alright.

656
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,640
Maybe the second word would be smile.

657
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,880
So, I'm a very happy person

658
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,480
and I smile a lot.

659
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,640
And this is the way

660
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,040
I want to live my life.

661
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,520
So when I was really young,

662
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,880
my mother told me that

663
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,520
if I'm not happy about something,

664
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,440
just walk away.

665
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,760
You don't have to stay in a place

666
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,560
where you're not happy.

667
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,240
And I did that.

668
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,440
So, I smile most of the time I think.
- Wonderful

669
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,400
And the last thing

670
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,880
that describe me, talk.

671
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,800
So, basically it's really hard for me

672
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,560
to shut up.

673
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,800
I love it. Explain a little bit more.

674
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,640
So, I think that I know a lot

675
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,440
about a lot of topics.

676
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,440
So I can talk to you about

677
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,040
all these kinds of different things.

678
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,800
If you try to go in depth to some of them,

679
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,200
maybe it won't work as well.

680
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,120
But I love it.

681
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,920
So, we can jump from one topic to another

682
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,040
and I can really hold a conversation

683
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,080
for a couple of hours.

684
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,680
I love it.

685
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,200
Stav, thank you very much

686
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,520
for your time and generosity.

687
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,840
Thank you for staying

688
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,680
with all the mishaps,

689
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,920
with the fires, and the Internet

690
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,120
but we managed to get this.

691
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
And this was just wonderful

692
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,160
and very insightful.

693
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,920
And stay safe and stay healthy.

694
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,880
Thank you very much.

695
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,600
You too. Bye.

696
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:19,280
Wonderful.
