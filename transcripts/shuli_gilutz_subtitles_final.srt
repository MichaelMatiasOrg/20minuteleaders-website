1
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,499
All right. Shuli Gilutz,

2
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,932
thank you so much for joining me.

3
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:13,866
Great to be here or there. Somewhere.

4
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:14,732
Who knows anymore.

5
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:17,499
Shuli, what does it mean to be an expert

6
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,932
on Children’s User Experience in digital?

7
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,099
What does that mean?

8
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,766
It's a great question

9
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:25,499
because I don't know if the word digital,

10
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,532
like how that refers to user experience,

11
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:29,666
but generally what we look at is how

12
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,399
to design environments, digital

13
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,732
environments, interactive

14
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:33,832
environments for kids

15
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,532
which are age appropriate.

16
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:36,799
So, age appropriate design.

17
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,199
It started out with a more cognitive focus

18
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,832
in terms of learning and attention,

19
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:45,066
but today we talk about social, relevance,

20
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:45,899
and emotional

21
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,366
and all these other challenges

22
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,866
that we have in designing.

23
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:51,299
So okay. So, when you talk about children,

24
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,499
what demographic are you an expert on?

25
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,199
Which demographic are we talking about?

26
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,932
So children zero to 18

27
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:01,199
that's the legal boundaries.

28
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,566
Even though research today talks about

29
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:06,266
childhood ending at around 25. So -

30
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:10,866
I'm still a kid! Great!
- Sorry all those out there

31
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:11,799
Finally, I have confirmation

32
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,166
that I can be a kid again.

33
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:13,966
Wonderful.

34
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:16,966
You are. But legally 18.

35
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:18,499
I guess it depends in different countries.

36
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,832
Some countries legal age

37
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,932
for different things

38
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:23,232
varies. The US 21 for some things,

39
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:25,332
but legally zero to 18.

40
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,766
So you know it's such a confusing time,

41
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:29,099
and it's such a fascinating time

42
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,932
to think about this

43
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:31,766
because I'm looking at all these

44
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,466
social media apps that are arising.

45
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:35,799
And it's incredible to see how,

46
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,966
I'm 24. I consider myself a child still

47
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:40,866
and a very young user,

48
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,599
yet I use Facebook primarily

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,732
then Instagram.

50
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:46,832
I don’t really know what Tiktok is,

51
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,399
but I heard that I'm supposed to be there.

52
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,832
But it's crazy because already I feel

53
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,932
illiterate when it comes to the usage

54
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:58,566
of how young people use social media

55
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:02,199
and interact with it overall.

56
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,532
So, tell me a little bit about

57
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:06,132
what is the study that you're doing?

58
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:08,699
And what are the differences between

59
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,832
the way that young people

60
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,899
use these things

61
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,199
versus the older generations

62
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,232
like myself?

63
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:17,499
So that's, exactly that's a great question

64
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,932
because you would not be considered

65
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:20,566
an old generation. You're a millennial.

66
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:22,899
I mean you're the younger generation

67
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,099
right? But what we see now is fascinating.

68
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,599
I've been in this field for about 20 years.

69
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,299
And we've always divided up kids

70
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,366
to five age groups, right.

71
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:31,666
So, you have your babies, your toddlers,

72
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:34,399
early elementary, tweens, and teens.

73
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,499
You'd think that that would be enough.

74
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,432
But apparently, it's not

75
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:39,632
because it turns out that every five years

76
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:41,199
there's this jump in technology

77
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,299
and what happens is

78
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,866
is not that the children become smarter.

79
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,332
Evolution doesn’t happen over five years

80
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,032
it happens over millions of years.

81
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:50,932
So what the difference is

82
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:52,166
is that when they're born with

83
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,332
certain technologies as a baseline,

84
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,832
they start from there,

85
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,032
and that's what the minimum

86
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,399
they expect everything

87
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,132
to work in a certain way.

88
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,532
So, you can even see with kids today,

89
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:04,199
like I have two children one is 13

90
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,366
and one is almost 10.

91
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:07,632
So my 13 year old, when he searches,

92
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:09,632
goes primarily to text based search,

93
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:11,432
YouTube, other place.

94
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:14,132
My 10-year-old, when she was very young

95
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:16,666
when she was four, YouTube Kids came out.

96
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,699
And I showed it to her.

97
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,099
And it has voice search.

98
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,432
So she would go, "Elsa."

99
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:24,666
and it would play Let It Go whatever.

100
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,399
She uses voice search today.

101
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,532
She can write. She could do anything.

102
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:29,666
It's a very, it just opened kind of a gap.

103
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,632
And he never uses voice search.

104
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:32,532
Why would he use voice search?

105
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:33,032
He could type.

106
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,199
But he's 13. So, you see already those

107
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,732
a few years have very different behaviors

108
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,532
and we see that with voice a lot today.

109
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:41,532
Kids growing up with Alexa at home,

110
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,566
and Google home, and Siri,

111
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,232
they treat voice very naturally,

112
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:46,966
while kids who are just a few years older

113
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:50,366
and old 20-year olds like yourself,

114
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:53,266
are like, "Okay. Maybe I'll use Siri here.

115
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:54,266
Maybe I'll use voice there"

116
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:56,532
But younger kids, it's just so natural to them

117
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:57,566
because it was always there.

118
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:59,499
Like their Legos and like their other books.

119
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,866
It was even there before they were able

120
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:03,966
to read and write, they were able to speak

121
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:06,266
and therefore if that's an option

122
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:08,332
on YouTube Kids then that becomes

123
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,966
their default way.

124
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:11,899
Exactly. And they're just used to it.

125
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,632
And when adults use it, they are like

126
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:15,866
"Okay. What should I say?

127
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:16,666
What's the command?

128
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,732
What's the right thing to do?"

129
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:20,132
Yeah. I think that's fascinating

130
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:23,399
because it's been, it must be already a few years.

131
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,232
My father is at Google and I've seen him

132
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:26,532
talk to his Google assistant

133
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:28,666
and I hate voice.

134
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:29,399
I can’t do voice.

135
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,299
I don't do the right command.

136
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,366
My phone doesn’t understand me.

137
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,399
I feel so old when it comes to these.

138
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,699
So, now I'm thinking that he's a revolutionary

139
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,466
that in his great age and he's been

140
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:41,566
using it for years. But it makes sense

141
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,999
that the new generations,

142
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,466
that's what they're gonna be adapted to.

143
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:46,099
So, this is where we should capitalize.

144
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,632
So, what else?

145
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,299
What other -

146
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:48,999
But I have to say though,

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,966
in defense of your father,

148
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:52,532
who is not a typical in his generation

149
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:53,132
I would say.

150
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:55,632
But actually voice is very big

151
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:57,632
with the older generation, with older adults

152
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:59,266
because it, again, allows them

153
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:00,899
to do things that maybe is harder

154
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,832
for them in other ways.

155
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:02,866
So, they are actually

156
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:04,032
early adopters in that area

157
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:05,066
which is really interesting.

158
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:05,499
I mean there are a lot of

159
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,066
parodies if you've seen the SNL ones

160
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:08,266
and others,

161
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:10,432
but voice is very big. And in many ways

162
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:12,166
I have this colleague who talks about

163
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:13,966
designing for older adults

164
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,432
and a lot of times we find ourselves

165
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:16,532
together in conferences.

166
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:17,466
Me talking about kids

167
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:18,599
and him talking about older adults

168
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,299
- Oh, that's awesome.
- ... there's a lot of similarities

169
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,966
Oh, that is so cool. Yeah.

170
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:23,399
Very interesting.

171
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,566
But the thing about kids is that

172
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,066
they're not afraid.

173
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:28,799
So, that's why kids are such great learners.

174
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,032
They take a phone and say,

175
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,132
"Hmn, what will happen if I put this

176
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:34,199
in the toilet? You know that would be cool."

177
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,032
And the parents are like, "Aaahh."

178
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:36,699
And they put it in and

179
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,299
then you have to put it

180
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,399
in rice and whatever.

181
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,799
Just so you know, rice works.

182
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,966
But they're curious

183
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:42,732
and they try everything.

184
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:44,199
So, when you try everything

185
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,732
you figure it out.

186
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:45,799
That's how you learn the best.

187
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,699
When you're like,

188
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,766
"Oh my God, what will I press?

189
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:48,732
What do I do?"

190
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:49,699
Then you don't learn anything.

191
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,699
Then it's much slow.

192
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,732
It's not that they're smarter.

193
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:53,266
It's just they're more open.

194
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:54,066
They're not afraid.

195
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,799
They don't care that it costs so much.

196
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,632
That's why they're great learners.

197
00:07:57,633 --> 00:07:59,066
And especially with technology,

198
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,032
and also the fact that they're not,

199
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,399
especially the younger kids,

200
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,132
they're not really aware to

201
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:05,166
what we mean by technology.

202
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:07,266
Like if you talk to young children, you ask them,

203
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:09,032
"You know, what's your favorite technology?"

204
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:10,032
They would be like,

205
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:12,432
"The refrigerator. The car."

206
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:14,599
Technology's everywhere. Right?

207
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,632
The distinction between digital,

208
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:18,032
that's what I said UX digital,

209
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:19,166
and non-digital

210
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,832
is a very old distinction.

211
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,899
It's an adult thing.

212
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,699
'cause you work in high tech.

213
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,432
Whatever that means.

214
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:26,099
They don't care you're creating stuff

215
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,732
for fun, for game, for learning, for play.

216
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:30,566
They don't care if Lego has sensor

217
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:32,432
or it doesn’t have sensors. Is it a fun game?

218
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:34,066
Yeah. That's what they care about.

219
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:36,366
So, these distinctions are very like

220
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:38,232
top down and very adult

221
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:39,566
and not relevant to their lives.

222
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:40,966
They are looking at the final product

223
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:41,966
and it's pure UX.

224
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,299
Like what's the experience here?

225
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,532
Is it a great learning experience?

226
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:45,466
Is it a fun experience?

227
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:46,632
Is it motivating?

228
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:47,732
Do they wanna play it more?

229
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:50,332
They don’t care if it has sensors, or digital

230
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,332
or whatever in it or not.

231
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,266
Right. So, you're teaching at Shenkar

232
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:54,566
and Tel Aviv University.

233
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,532
And what do you focus on?

234
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:58,832
And what do entrepreneurs

235
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,066
today who are building products

236
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:02,332
that are going to be used by kids

237
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,399
or other demographics,

238
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,666
is this something that they need to

239
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,266
keep in mind and really understand

240
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:08,032
the different user experiences?

241
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:09,932
Is there a really clear distinction?

242
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:12,499
Yeah. I think that's two different things.

243
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,599
I think students at Tel Aviv University

244
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,232
and Shenkar, they're very interested in this.

245
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:19,266
They see what's happening around them.

246
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,599
They can tell the difference.

247
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,699
They don't really know

248
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,232
how to gauge it exactly.

249
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:24,932
You know, are people are into Minecraft

250
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:25,666
or Fortnite

251
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:26,799
these days? Or is it Tiktok

252
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,032
or Snapchat. Like, what's going on?

253
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:31,099
And it's fine and it's exciting.

254
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,566
But I think, the important thing for

255
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,566
entrepreneurs is really to understand

256
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,966
that there's a variety of kids.

257
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,299
I've worked with so many companies

258
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:38,866
that come and say,

259
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:42,566
"Okay my kid, they love reading on an iPad

260
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,266
so I'll develop a blah blah blah blah"

261
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:44,866
Okay.

262
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:46,432
Let's see what their age group.

263
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:47,266
You know how many kids,

264
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:48,832
what's developmentally appropriate?

265
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,866
So there are all these myths that we really

266
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:52,832
have to do ... user research to,

267
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,332
but like with any other UX

268
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,432
and any other product,

269
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:56,866
to tease them apart.

270
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:57,766
There are a lot of myths

271
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:58,666
about kids and technology.

272
00:09:58,667 --> 00:09:59,999
And unfortunately,

273
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,299
the biggest one is screen time.

274
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,299
Everybody is afraid of screen time

275
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,999
especially in the valley.

276
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,566
And I think it's really interesting because

277
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,399
there is no such thing as screen time.

278
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,499
If you look at,

279
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,499
I gave my kids 20 minutes

280
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,299
of screen time today.

281
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,066
What does that mean?

282
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:18,232
Were they watching 20 minutes

283
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:19,266
of Sesame Street?

284
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:21,499
National Geographic? Or porn?

285
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,099
Were they watching reality TV

286
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,599
or sports? Was it Dora?

287
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,666
What does that even mean?

288
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:28,899
It's like you would never,

289
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,866
you know in a book or any other game,

290
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:32,299
it's about the content

291
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,366
and then the context.

292
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:34,299
What are the alternatives?

293
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,932
Now 20 minutes of screen time

294
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:37,432
can mean talking to grandma.

295
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:39,399
You know because you can’t go visit her.

296
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,199
So is screen bad?

297
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,966
Right.

298
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:44,599
So it's really about the content,

299
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,632
the context, and the alternative. Right?

300
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:49,532
And also the specific child.

301
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:50,732
What's the age group?

302
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,466
What are their capabilities?

303
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:54,666
What do they need in their lives?

304
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:58,599
So, I think by boxing it all on screen time,

305
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,632
we're really doing a disservice for our kids.

306
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:04,432
And also, we're kind of not looking at ourselves

307
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:07,166
because as the adults around the kids,

308
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,499
we're on this thing all the time.

309
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,899
Not 20 minutes. Not 20 hours,

310
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,699
but 24 hours 24/7.

311
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,332
And there's so many surveys to show that.

312
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,432
So, these kids are growing up

313
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:22,699
in a very different childhood

314
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,432
than you grew up in,

315
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,032
than I grew up in for sure

316
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:26,432
where everybody's connected

317
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:27,066
all the time,

318
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:28,066
and they wanna be like the adults

319
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:28,766
around them.

320
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:31,899
So, it's not fair to judge them and say

321
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,032
"Oh, but when I was a kid

322
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:34,632
we use to play outside all the time."

323
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:37,266
Right. Because you didn’t have this

324
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:39,599
super computer library in your pocket

325
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,199
all the time and neither did your parents.

326
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,599
or your siblings, or your friends,

327
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,299
and everybody else.

328
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,032
Very different childhoods especially 2020.

329
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:52,232
This, everything's changed -
- This acceleration is amazing. Right.

330
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:53,466
I mean amazing in the sense

331
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:54,832
that it's remarkable. I don't know if it's,

332
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,199
I don’t know what it's going to be on kids.

333
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,366
But one of the things that

334
00:11:58,367 --> 00:11:58,932
I’m curious about,

335
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:01,132
so we talked about this trend that

336
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:03,866
kids are much more into experimentation

337
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:06,332
and as the generations grow older,

338
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,432
the will or the excitement

339
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:11,232
about experimentation decreases or

340
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:13,132
there's an increased anxiety or fear.

341
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,666
Are there other key differences

342
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:16,666
that you've noticed

343
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,799
between the usage of kids

344
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,466
versus the usage of adults?

345
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:23,366
And something that product designers

346
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,999
or entrepreneurs can keep in mind

347
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,832
as they're designing their products

348
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,132
for the different demographics?

349
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,566
Yes. Definitely.

350
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:31,832
So, number one I think

351
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,199
the most important one is motivation.

352
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,132
So when you're designing a product

353
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:35,766
for adults,

354
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:37,132
your motivations are a lot of times

355
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:38,866
utility. You wanna be efficient,

356
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:40,999
you wanna get time on task

357
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,532
is a measure.

358
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,932
You check your ROI according to

359
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:46,199
how much time you saving,

360
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,332
how much money you're saving.

361
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,766
With kids, it's just not the case.

362
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:51,299
Again, it depends on the age group,

363
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,699
the content, and the context,

364
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,599
but a lot of times, kids are using

365
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,299
technology for fun, for entertainment,

366
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,932
for learning.

367
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:59,932
They will spend an hour watching

368
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:02,266
something that you think is not of value

369
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:03,799
but for them it's huge.

370
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,232
And if you really wanna empower them,

371
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,132
and give them the ability to create

372
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:10,232
like drawings, so if they're drawing a ...

373
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:13,266
if they're creating stop-motion animation

374
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,899
or if they're creating video games

375
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,766
that they're programming.

376
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,066
That will take hours.

377
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:20,099
So, it's not about efficiency

378
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,199
which is very important.

379
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,099
It's a very different thing

380
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,432
when you're doing UX for adults.

381
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:24,699
Efficiency is a very big thing.

382
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,932
So motivation, intrinsic motivation,

383
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,099
things that I'm passionate about

384
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,432
while adults a lot of times have

385
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:33,199
external motivation. Things for work.

386
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,199
Changes the ability.

387
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,099
There was a bid trend of gamification a few years ago.

388
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,532
I think that's gone down a bit

389
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:40,832
'cause people understand that

390
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,966
once you're doing things for badges and

391
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:44,366
leaderboards and stars,

392
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:46,799
that becomes the motivation and

393
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,666
you forget about

394
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,366
what you're actually loving to do.

395
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:52,466
So, even in places like Khan academy

396
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:54,132
and places that have really

397
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,099
kind of novel ways to treat education

398
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,099
are doing great things,

399
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,499
they've lowered the gamification of it
- Really?

400
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,399
so the focus is still the content.

401
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,632
So, gamification works.

402
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:08,199
No doubt about it. It works.
- 100%

403
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,132
It just changes the focus

404
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:11,699
from the content

405
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,532
So for different people

406
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:14,332
it does different things.

407
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,966
Interesting. But I do have to say that

408
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:18,432
I was looking for motivation to finish

409
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:19,666
a course on Khan Academy back

410
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:21,099
when I was in high school.

411
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,566
And I was doing self-study

412
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:23,432
for advanced math.

413
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:25,399
And the fact that I had those badges

414
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,866
and I had that streak.

415
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,732
All of sudden it kept me from

416
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,532
exiting a video because I knew that if

417
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,099
I just listened to the last two minutes,

418
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,932
which are always important because

419
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:34,532
that's where you usually

420
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:35,232
have the summary,

421
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:36,632
but we think,

422
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:37,832
every kid thinks

423
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:38,899
he's the smartest kid in the world.

424
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,132
So you think "Ah I don’t need to listen

425
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:41,166
to the summary. I got it"

426
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:43,566
But I wouldn’t have received my

427
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,632
extra 90 tokens if I didn’t stay on.

428
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,799
So I stayed on and I'm very thankful

429
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,399
that I did that.

430
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,199
Shuli, talk to me a little bit

431
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,732
about your work.

432
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,066
What does it mean to be

433
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:54,732
an expert on user experience for kids?

434
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:56,232
Do you work with startups?

435
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:57,832
Do you teach? How does it work?

436
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:02,232
So okay. So, I have a few different bits

437
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:02,766
to my work.

438
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:03,899
I'm very inter-disciplinary

439
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,266
I got one foot in academia

440
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:06,099
one foot in industry.

441
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,299
I don’t really fit anywhere.

442
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,266
But I really enjoy it

443
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:09,499
'cause I love theory

444
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,799
and I love research

445
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,732
and I love thinking about products

446
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:13,999
that just benefit kids

447
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,932
without have to thinking

448
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:16,132
about marketing, sales,

449
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:16,932
and all of that stuff.

450
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:19,332
However, I like doing things

451
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,166
in the real world that

452
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:21,432
actually reach kids too.

453
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:23,199
So trying to do both.

454
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,399
I consult companies who develop

455
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:26,932
products for kids.

456
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:28,732
These could be AR, VR,

457
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:31,966
and apps like digital TV apps.

458
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:33,299
Or now I'm working with a company

459
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,666
that's developing an online platform

460
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,499
for education.

461
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,099
So, when they're doing

462
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,266
these products we do the full UX process.

463
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:41,466
So we think about who are the stakeholders?

464
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:42,166
Who are the users?

465
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:43,866
Where are their painpoints, the ...

466
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:44,299
the journey,

467
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,766
but we do add the unique factors

468
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,966
of designing for kids and for families

469
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:51,266
which go together with designing

470
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:51,866
for Children's Rights

471
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,232
which is another organization

472
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:55,166
I'm part of. And thinking about

473
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:57,066
what this affords them?

474
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:58,766
What this really gives them?

475
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:00,466
More than only what they need

476
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:03,266
'cause needs is again, it's a very adult kind of a word,

477
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:05,299
our painpoints,

478
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,432
that means you have a goal

479
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,032
and you have an efficiency and so forth.

480
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,132
And there are also

481
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:10,499
some legal considerations

482
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,632
of course to consider,

483
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:14,332
data, privacy, security,

484
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,399
when you're designing for kids

485
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,666
which are slightly different

486
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:17,699
again, depending on the

487
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,032
different age groups.

488
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:21,966
When you said the word children’s rights

489
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:23,299
immediately my thought was

490
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,299
How do you design responsibly for kids,

491
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,966
not just in terms of the legal aspect

492
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:27,932
on the data and privacy,

493
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:29,866
but also in terms of,

494
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:31,532
it's much easier I think,

495
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,699
I'm assuming, to get a kid addicted to

496
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,432
something than it is

497
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:35,299
to get an adult addicted

498
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,899
because the adult has those firewalls,

499
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,166
those internal firewalls, that tell them

500
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,099
"Uh-Oh, I'm actually spending too much time here

501
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,599
or I'm not doing the right thing"

502
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,999
A kid may not have that.

503
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,999
So, what is the responsibility here

504
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,132
in terms of understanding

505
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,299
how to design responsibly for kids?

506
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,699
So, ethics are big.

507
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,732
So, you hit the point.

508
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:56,666
I mean adults have that or not,

509
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:57,766
but we can’t, they're adults.

510
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,532
They can do whatever they want.

511
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:00,999
We do have legal protection

512
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,966
for different things,

513
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:03,066
from gambling to other things,

514
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,699
but we know that there are ways

515
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,099
you could use dark UX

516
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,232
to create addictions and so forth.

517
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:09,766
Now, for kids that's worse because -

518
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:11,999
I like that term. Dark UX.

519
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,166
Dark UX. There you go.

520
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,666
Look it up. You'll find creepy stuff.

521
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:20,532
But for kids, especially younger kids,

522
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:21,232
they don’t even know

523
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:22,199
that some things are ads.

524
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,932
I mean I had this conversation with my son

525
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:24,666
a few years ago

526
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:26,166
when one of his favorite youtubers

527
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:27,699
was showing him something

528
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,232
with Lego or Minecraft I don't remember.

529
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,266
And I told him,

530
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:31,599
"Well you know he gets paid for that."

531
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,066
He looked at me he's like,

532
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:33,999
"What?"

533
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,632
I said, "Yeah,

534
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:35,732
you know they're promoting it."

535
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:36,266
And I said,

536
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:37,399
"You know I like this youtuber.

537
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,832
I really do. He's awesome.

538
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,332
He picks really good products.

539
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,799
I like the way he does stuff.

540
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,799
That's why I let you watch him,

541
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,199
but you should know that Lego

542
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,732
paid him to go to Legoland

543
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:47,532
to get this stuff."

544
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,432
He started crying and he's like,

545
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:50,732
"How can you say that?

546
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:52,832
This is just what he loves."

547
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,166
So we had now,

548
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:55,699
of course, my kids,

549
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,199
they're involved in my career.

550
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,532
So they know what’s going on.

551
00:17:58,533 --> 00:17:59,932
But a lot of kids don’t.

552
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:01,899
You know they believe that these influencers

553
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,066
are passionate about this stuff.

554
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:05,466
Now, some of the stuff that

555
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:06,866
youtubers pull are awesome.

556
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:08,666
A lot of environmental stuff,

557
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,166
a lot of great stuff.

558
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,799
But they are promoters

559
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,299
of all kinds of efforts

560
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,399
and there's no way,

561
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,666
and TV, in linear TV, there used to be

562
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,432
"We'll be back after these messages"

563
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:19,866
Right? When you were watching a show

564
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:21,032
and you were going to commercials.

565
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,299
That was a way to tell children

566
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,132
okay, the cartoons you're seeing now

567
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:25,932
are ads.

568
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:27,932
The cartoons you saw before are content

569
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,366
'cause how would they distinguish it

570
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:30,499
they have the same characters.

571
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,332
There's a Spiderman here and Spiderman there.

572
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,732
It’s the same.

573
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,232
In internet and digital,

574
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:36,299
we don’t have that linear experience.

575
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,732
So you have to be very responsible.

576
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:40,299
There's a lot going on in terms of ads

577
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,099
and kids’ apps, and paid stuff,

578
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,932
and different models for it.

579
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:46,432
But yeah, you have to be aware

580
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:47,732
of these things and think about it,

581
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:49,499
and think about what kind of experience

582
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,699
you want to create for your users

583
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,099
ethically not only legally.

584
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,899
I think two things came to mind

585
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,099
when you were giving that example

586
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,132
of my beautiful niece

587
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,299
who's now five years old

588
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,866
but this is already relevant

589
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:00,766
from when she was three

590
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:01,666
that she would watch these

591
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,432
unboxing videos on YouTube.

592
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,566
And when I saw that,

593
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:05,166
I thought it was the

594
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:05,766
most ridiculous thing.

595
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:07,299
I couldn’t believe that we're watching

596
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,999
another kid unbox a toy now.

597
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,966
And then I looked at how many

598
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:12,866
views and it had a billion views.

599
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:14,199
It was one of the most

600
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,366
popular videos on YouTube.

601
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:17,932
And then every time

602
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:21,199
on YouTube there was the ads

603
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,399
that come up in the middle.

604
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,599
She would go furious.

605
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,332
She would say, "I don’t understand.

606
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,932
How do I exit out of this?

607
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,032
How do I skip?"

608
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,099
And I thought it was just incredible

609
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,899
because I grew up

610
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,999
Saturday morning I go to the TV,

611
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,099
and I watch my cartoons

612
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,399
and I wait. And I wait for the cartoons

613
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,966
and whatever happens happens.

614
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:41,399
Right. But that's a great point

615
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,999
because first of all the cartoon thing,

616
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,232
yeah they don’t get the whole

617
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:45,632
why do we have to wait

618
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:46,566
and why do I have to watch?

619
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:47,866
But the adults don’t get it either.

620
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,166
So, they're good.

621
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,532
They're along with everything.

622
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:53,332
But the thing about the unboxing

623
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,866
and there's a lot been written about that

624
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:55,666
but it's really cool.

625
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:57,166
So if you think about play patterns.

626
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:59,299
Play patterns don’t change across media,

627
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,966
but if you think about peek-a-boo, right,

628
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,566
it's the same thing. It's unboxing.

629
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:06,132
So, you're just walking and, "Wow! Surprise!"

630
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:07,066
And then another one.

631
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:09,099
"Wow! And I wonder what's gonna be

632
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,299
in there now." So, it's so exciting.

633
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,266
We call it unboxing because

634
00:20:13,267 --> 00:20:15,366
we have no clue what's going on there.

635
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:17,799
But for them it's just a surprise show

636
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,499
after surprise after surprise

637
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,199
which is really cool.

638
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,566
You know how when kids get gifts

639
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:22,366
they say that

640
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:23,499
the box part is the best part

641
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,499
they play with the cardboard.
- Yeah!

642
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,066
That's it. Over and over again.

643
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:28,866
It's amazing.

644
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:30,066
It's perfect.

645
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:31,332
That is so so cool.

646
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,499
Are there different things

647
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,799
that we should be worried about

648
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,999
with the way that generations are moving

649
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,566
and interacting with technology?

650
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:40,699
Should I be worried about

651
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,966
some of the things that my niece

652
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:44,199
is going to experience different

653
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,199
from the way I will

654
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,999
whether in terms of social interactions,

655
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,199
or personal fulfillment,

656
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,699
or emotional intelligence?

657
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,932
Well yeah, but it's hard to say what.

658
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:57,199
So I think the problem with that is that

659
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,832
a lot of parents today

660
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,666
don’t know what their kids are doing.

661
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,466
They can’t deal with it.

662
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:04,266
Parenting is hard. You're parenting,

663
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:06,266
your kids are doing stuff you haven’t

664
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:07,099
done when you were a kid.

665
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,199
They're not watching Saturday

666
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,166
morning cartoons anymore, or

667
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,199
maybe they are but they're doing

668
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,366
a million other things.

669
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:13,499
And so, you have to learn

670
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,499
what they're doing.

671
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,532
What's right and wrong.

672
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:16,532
What's going on.

673
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:18,332
It's really really difficult.

674
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,499
So, a lot of parents are like just

675
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,366
do whatever you need to do.

676
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:22,432
Let me know if I have to buy something.

677
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:24,732
And that's a bit problematic

678
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:26,066
because you would never let your kid

679
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,032
just go around the street

680
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:28,432
and go to people you don’t know.

681
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:30,866
And there could be things that are not

682
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:31,999
for them or dangerous.

683
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,832
Or even if you let them play like

684
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,932
I had a mom, I talked about Fortnite and

685
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:37,099
how I thought it was actually

686
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,732
a pretty cool game for tweens.

687
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:40,532
And she was so angry and she said

688
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,966
"You know my kid you should see him after

689
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:44,599
he plays eight hours of Fortnite.

690
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,499
He's like a zombie."

691
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:45,966
And I'm like,

692
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:47,966
"Why is he playing eight hours of Fortnite?"

693
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:51,132
One hour. Two hours.

694
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:52,899
With his friends that's awesome.

695
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,532
It's a game that has diversity.

696
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:55,299
You play with groups.

697
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,266
You're assigned gender and ethnicity,

698
00:21:57,267 --> 00:22:00,499
random. There's no blood.

699
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,066
There's sweet little cute animals.

700
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:02,932
There's dances.

701
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:06,599
Eight hours? Like eight hours?

702
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,032
So and I think,

703
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:09,366
'cause she's like, "Ah, yeah

704
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:11,232
he's playing with his friends"

705
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:13,032
So, I think the problem for the kids

706
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,799
is not the technology per se,

707
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,899
but the problem is the parents

708
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,099
are kind of stuck. They don’t know.

709
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,266
They don’t know enough about

710
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:20,132
when to say yes.

711
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:20,932
They have to sit down

712
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:22,266
and play with their kids.

713
00:22:22,267 --> 00:22:24,432
They have to know what Fortnite really is.

714
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:25,732
What Minecraft really is.

715
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:28,166
And then they’ll know how to parent it.

716
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:29,366
Like they do with anything else.

717
00:22:29,367 --> 00:22:30,366
There’s no other way

718
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:31,366
because it keeps changing.

719
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:33,866
It's like you said about Tiktok.

720
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:35,666
Today it's Tiktok.

721
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,199
Two years ago it was Snapchat.

722
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,499
Two years ago it was something else.

723
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,532
It's gonna be something else soon

724
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:41,432
'cause too many adults are in Tiktok.

725
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:42,366
The teens are gonna leave.

726
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:43,932
They don’t want adults there.

727
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:45,732
Really, adults are going on Tiktok?

728
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:48,932
Oh yeah. All these moms are trying

729
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:49,866
to be cool.

730
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:51,266
And all these companies are trying to

731
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:52,299
use Tiktok as a platform

732
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,899
for products of course.

733
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,299
So, the minute that happens

734
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,699
you know it's gonna shift soon

735
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,566
in some way.

736
00:22:58,567 --> 00:22:59,866
But the thing is that,

737
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:01,399
parents have to know.

738
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,732
So, my advice would be

739
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:03,799
just sit down and play.

740
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,132
Don’t read articles whatever.

741
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,332
Just sit down and play with your kids.

742
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,566
Just see what's going on.

743
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:09,199
What do they do?

744
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,499
They'll love it.

745
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,299
They wanna talk to you about these things.

746
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,299
Fascinating.

747
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,732
And if they're at the point where they don’t,

748
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:15,532
where they’re teens already,

749
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:19,832
that's difficult. But still, be there with them.

750
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:20,899
Just show them you care.

751
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,066
Show them that you're into it

752
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,532
'cause once you dismiss it all as screen time

753
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:26,732
or "Oh c'mon I don’t understand about that"

754
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:29,766
then you're just creating a bigger gap

755
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,066
and it's harder to parent that way.

756
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:32,999
100%. Shuli, 20 minutes go by

757
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,899
so so fast, but I have to ask you the most

758
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,932
important question. Three words that

759
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:37,699
best describe you.

760
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,799
... okay. One I guess it would be

761
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,632
interdisciplinary because I don’t know

762
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:44,432
what I do.

763
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:46,932
The other one would be curious 'cause

764
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:49,066
I'm always interested in what’s going on.

765
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:50,566
And the last one would be an optimist

766
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:53,299
because I really believe it's all good,
and it's gonna better

767
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,566
Wow. Most people when they talk

768
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,799
about this the way that kids

769
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,732
interact with technology

770
00:23:58,733 --> 00:23:59,932
and the addiction, they're very,

771
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:02,166
they're on the opposite spectrum

772
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:03,366
of optimism.

773
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:04,832
Because they haven’t talked to kids.

774
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,932
You know what, that's what I love about what I do.

775
00:24:06,933 --> 00:24:08,366
I get to sit and talk to them,

776
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:08,866
and play with them,

777
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:09,566
and they’re the best.

778
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:11,766
That's amazing. Shuli, toda raba.

779
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:12,966
Thank you very very much.

780
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:14,899
Toda. Stay safe and stay healthy.

781
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:43,467
Thanks. Bye.
