1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,239
It was a way for people

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,119
to authentically connect to one another

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,199
and have a community

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,142
and get to know people

5
00:00:05,143 --> 00:00:06,319
based on their values

6
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,350
without necessarily being salesy.

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,239
Stephanie Andrews, thank you so much

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,559
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,360
How are you?

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,159
I'm great. How are you?

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,199
I'm doing fine.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,559
Thank you so much for joining me.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,079
Thank you for being generous

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,839
with your time.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,039
I can't wait to talk to you about

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,399
your journey, about co-founding a startup

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,279
with your two best friends.

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,519
And more importantly, about

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,679
the world of podcasting.

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,106
So, I've had the privilege

21
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:03,999
of being a podcaster for,

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,719
I guess, about almost 8 months now.

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,439
And I've seen the ups and downs of it.

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,440
But I'm excited to learn about

25
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:11,919
the industry from you.

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,439
So, Stephanie, before we get started,

27
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:13,879
can you tell me

28
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,919
a little bit about yourself

29
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,800
and what you're doing at Quill today?

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,159
Yeah, absolutely.

31
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,247
Hi, I'm Steph to everyone listening.

32
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:24,399
And I am currently

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,119
Quill's Head of Production.

34
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,759
Prior to that,

35
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,440
I was the co-founder and CEO

36
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,720
of a startup called Origins Media Haus,

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,480
which was a boutique podcast

38
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,440
and video agency in Toronto.

39
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,320
And it definitely wasn't

40
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:39,440
a linear path to get there.

41
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:41,239
We pivoted multiple times.

42
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,679
We actually started

43
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,639
the company as a online magazine back

44
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,319
when I was in my first year of university.

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,519
And over three to four years we pivoted,

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,559
tried to understand

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,719
the content creation world,

48
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,639
and eventually landed on podcasting

49
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,119
as a way for brands

50
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,999
to connect really interestingly

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,959
with their consumers.

52
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,879
Because it was a way for people

53
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,759
to authentically connect to one another

54
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,839
and have a community

55
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,783
and get to know people

56
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:06,959
based on their values

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,239
without necessarily being salesy.

58
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,982
So, that's really what we stood for

59
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:11,679
as a company,

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,399
as we wanted to make sure

61
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,519
that brands were connecting

62
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,799
with their consumers in a way

63
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,359
that was authentic and it was real.

64
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,279
And it wasn't just like a sales pitch

65
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,679
or buy this or buy this.

66
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,359
We wanted people

67
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,519
to make informed decisions.

68
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,359
And so, that was really kind

69
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,359
of our bread and butter

70
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,159
and where we started

71
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,159
and how we landed

72
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,759
on the podcasting realm.

73
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,199
And yeah, so then we ended up getting a part.

74
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,319
So, before we move on to that other part,

75
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,119
I have to understand a little bit better

76
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,759
the pain point

77
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,599
that you're trying to solve.

78
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,079
So, you're mentioning that

79
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,919
you're looking at podcasting

80
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,959
as a tool for brands

81
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,079
to engage with their users

82
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,039
in a more authentic way,

83
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,559
less salesy way.

84
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,319
Can you paint me a picture of what

85
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,679
that looks like today

86
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,519
or what it looked like

87
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,020
a few years ago

88
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:55,119
when you were just getting started?

89
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,999
Because I do know that podcasting

90
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,799
is that at peak. Right?

91
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,719
We're seeing more and more podcasts.

92
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,079
But what is it about podcasting

93
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,160
that is so engaging and non-salesy?

94
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,479
Yeah.

95
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,159
So, what's really interesting

96
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,999
about podcasting in my opinion is

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,959
it's kind of a two fold.

98
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,479
So, one is your connection

99
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,399
with the host of the show.

100
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,159
And then the second is really

101
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,479
the convenience of the medium itself

102
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,479
as being the audio.

103
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,999
So, one, being able

104
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,319
to connect to a host.

105
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,719
When you're able to listen

106
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,279
to someone for 40 minutes,

107
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,079
a really good host should sound like

108
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,759
you're talking to a good friend.

109
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,359
It should sound like

110
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,520
you're just on the phone.

111
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,440
You don't have to say anything

112
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,280
and you're comfortable.

113
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,200
And what that does is

114
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,400
it builds a really interesting

115
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,640
parasocial relationship where you're

116
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,400
the host is able to essentially

117
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,040
talk to you and talk to your values

118
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,240
and you're able to relate to them

119
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,680
and feel like you know them,

120
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,080
but you've never actually met them.

121
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,080
And what that does is,

122
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,680
as a friend, let's say,

123
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,200
if this host is maybe the CEO

124
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,680
of a company then

125
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,920
and you connect with their values,

126
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:56,279
then you're going to be more likely

127
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,919
to like that company

128
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,119
and you're going to be more likely

129
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,319
to probably buy from that brand.

130
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,399
Let's say it's a consumer brand.

131
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,039
Right?

132
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,839
And so, for example,

133
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,799
there's been some really interesting

134
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,519
shows that have used this.

135
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,039
So, Breadwinners is an example

136
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,239
from Harvest Bread

137
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,079
where what they did

138
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,072
was they created a show

139
00:04:14,073 --> 00:04:15,279
all about women empowerment

140
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,959
and women breadwinners.

141
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,999
And what that did is

142
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,759
it showed that this bread brand

143
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,759
had like values and it had,

144
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,999
it wanted to empower women.

145
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,799
And so women listening are like,

146
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,799
okay, well, if I'm going

147
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,879
to buy bread brands

148
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,119
and I believe in these values,

149
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,440
I'm going to buy Harvest right?

150
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,520
So, that's kind

151
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,720
of the interesting part of it,

152
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,000
podcasting from a connection standpoint.

153
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,200
And then in the medium,

154
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:41,759
what's interesting is if you look

155
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,119
at video, if you look at blogs,

156
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,399
the correlation to those two mediums

157
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,239
is you have to be staring at a screen.

158
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,319
And especially today,

159
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,079
I think when we look at covid

160
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,279
and the pandemic,

161
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,265
what are we doing all day every day

162
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:55,450
is just staring at screen.

163
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:57,999
It's like you stare at the middle screen

164
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,239
and then you go off work

165
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,559
and then you stare at the big screen

166
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,039
and then you stare

167
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,743
at your small screen

168
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:03,639
when you're talking to someone

169
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,359
and you just can't get away from it.

170
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,599
So, podcasting offers a really nice,

171
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,839
convenient medium where

172
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,319
you can literally listen to it anywhere.

173
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,760
You can listen to it in your car

174
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:12,599
while you're driving,

175
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,799
you can listen to it

176
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,719
while taking a shower,

177
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,439
while you're cooking,

178
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,679
whatever you want.

179
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,519
And video and blogs

180
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,879
just can't offer that.

181
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,680
And especially today

182
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:22,919
when we look at how fast everything

183
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,239
is rapidly evolving,

184
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,879
humans are trying to constantly keep up

185
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,320
and humans are trying to constantly

186
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,559
consume information.

187
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,079
And so, podcasting offers

188
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,919
a convenient way

189
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,959
to be consistently consuming

190
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,039
without necessarily having

191
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,039
to put energy into consuming.

192
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,519
So, that makes all sense.

193
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,320
So, I'm completely sold on this idea

194
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,759
that podcasting is important,

195
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,759
it's something relevant,

196
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,959
it's extremely relevant for brands.

197
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,639
I feel a little bit silly that

198
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,359
we're doing this over a video then.

199
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,879
But good thing that we're also taking

200
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,959
the audio for Spotify

201
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,559
and Apple podcasts, at least that.

202
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,279
I'll give you a pass.

203
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,279
Thank you.

204
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,199
Give me a little bit

205
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,039
of a higher understanding as to

206
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,119
the market of podcasting.

207
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,519
How many are there like,

208
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,559
how many people podcast generally

209
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,639
or listeners?

210
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,440
I really don't know.

211
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:09,879
Yeah.

212
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,399
So, podcasting is actually

213
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,239
a really interesting medium

214
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,719
from an audience standpoint because

215
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,159
it's all made up

216
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,319
of mostly affluent millennials.

217
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,879
And obviously that's expanded a bit

218
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,394
since podcasting has kind of

219
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:21,799
increased over the years.

220
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,160
But the base of it is really

221
00:06:23,161 --> 00:06:24,439
that niche audience.

222
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,679
And people are highly educated as well.

223
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,800
And so, if you're looking

224
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,360
for brands, it's kind of

225
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,640
this beautiful medium because

226
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,519
it's people who generally have

227
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,679
a higher income,

228
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,879
who are wanting

229
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,799
to connect with values,

230
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,199
who have that kind of higher,

231
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,959
they're looking for basically brands

232
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,799
to connect to.

233
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,519
They're looking for that information

234
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,599
and they're looking for brands

235
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,959
that are conscious, I would say.

236
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,239
So that's interesting

237
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,239
from an audience standpoint.

238
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,639
In terms of how big the market is,

239
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,839
there's over a million podcasts.

240
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,119
But what people don't realize,

241
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,040
is that there's a ton of podcasts out there

242
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,960
that aren't active.

243
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,359
A million podcast?

244
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,679
Yeah.

245
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,840
We surpass a million this year as well.

246
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,192
But what people don't realize

247
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:09,639
is that sounds like a lot.

248
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,239
But it's really not, because if you look at

249
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,400
how many videos there are,

250
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:15,199
if you look at how many blogs there are,

251
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,519
there's so many more.

252
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,439
And then on top of that,

253
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,279
if you look at the podcasting industry

254
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,279
out of that million,

255
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,439
there's so many that are inactive.

256
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,760
So, when you're actually starting a podcast,

257
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:26,799
if you're going to actually

258
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,400
do it properly,

259
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,800
you're going to be consistent.

260
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:29,919
You're going to be putting out episodes.

261
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,319
You're going

262
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,640
to look at it like a marathon,

263
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,200
not a sprint.

264
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,000
You're going to consistently

265
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,040
put out episodes.

266
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,360
Your ability to build an audience

267
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,880
is going to be a lot greater

268
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:38,039
than it would in my opinion,

269
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,079
than any other medium

270
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,639
out there right now.

271
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,160
Wow.

272
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:44,239
Okay, so where we seeing this going?

273
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,359
So, do we see

274
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,199
a continuous linear growth,

275
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,239
exponential growth?

276
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,839
Are more brands understanding this?

277
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,000
What's happening to the market?

278
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,320
Yeah.

279
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:54,599
So in terms of the market right now,

280
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,120
we're seeing a lot

281
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:57,239
of brands invest pretty heavily

282
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,919
into podcasting ads.

283
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,520
And I think people

284
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,320
are starting to kind of open their eyes.

285
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,400
Specifically in the US,

286
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,880
you'll see a lot of brands that

287
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,000
are having,

288
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:09,959
a lot of brands that have

289
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,400
their own podcasts already.

290
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:14,119
Canada, I think is a little bit behind.

291
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,039
But that's usual.

292
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,159
Not surprising there.

293
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,679
And you're from Canada, right?

294
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,320
But it's.

295
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,680
Oh yeah.

296
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,279
Yeah. I'm from Toronto.

297
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,279
So, I'm very used to

298
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,440
the conservative nature of Canadians.

299
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,920
But yeah.

300
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,680
So, I would say that

301
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,720
the media industry honestly is just much

302
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,519
it's just more advanced down south.

303
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
So, yeah, we're starting to see

304
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,240
a lot of brands kind

305
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,760
of pour more dollars into it.

306
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,160
And I personally think that

307
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,520
in the next couple of years

308
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:44,759
we're going to start seeing

309
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,000
the same trend as videos, like eventually

310
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:48,679
I think there's going to be people

311
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,639
whose job titles are podcast marketers.

312
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,479
And I think it's going to be

313
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,479
a mainstream media that

314
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,279
you just have to have as a brand

315
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,500
and as part of your playbook.

316
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,000
That makes a lot of sense.

317
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:58,759
So, tell me a little bit about

318
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,279
your entrepreneurial journey

319
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,920
with creating a company

320
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:05,600
with two of your best friends.

321
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,080
Yeah, sure.

322
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,400
So, when we started the company,

323
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,840
I was literally 17 years old.

324
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,680
And I remember,

325
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,440
I walked into my first year

326
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,160
of university business class.

327
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,680
And the first thing that the prof said

328
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,280
was that 95% of startups fail.

329
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,320
And so, me being a small

330
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,560
17 year old human

331
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,200
who wanted to start her company so bad,

332
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:33,719
I was like, great, that's fabulous.

333
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,639
And so, I basically being someone

334
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,760
who in high school,

335
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,240
I was like a straight-A student.

336
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,280
I was very perfectionists

337
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,640
and I never failed at anything.

338
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,840
And so I was like, okay,

339
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:46,119
so, how do I not fail at this?

340
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,039
I'm going to go and interview the 5%

341
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,039
of entrepreneurs that are successful

342
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,519
and figure out how they did it.

343
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,239
And so, long story short,

344
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,159
we ended up creating an online magazine

345
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,160
where we interviewed over

346
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:58,599
100 entrepreneurs, Britt and Ali,

347
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,239
my two co-founders ended up coming

348
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,479
into the folds a few months after

349
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,679
I kind of conceptualized it.

350
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,839
And we were all

351
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,720
in our first year university

352
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,040
at that point.

353
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,479
And basically we started interviewing,

354
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,560
interviewing, interviewing.

355
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,720
And started to build it up.

356
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,000
Britt was an amazing

357
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,320
at technical video production, recording,

358
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:21,799
of anything web related.

359
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,639
She was just really good

360
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,159
at figuring things out.

361
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,239
I tended to be more on the marketing

362
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
and business development side,

363
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,520
getting into interviews.

364
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,640
And Ali was always really good

365
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:31,399
at kind of tying those two worlds together

366
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,119
in terms of content creation and brand,

367
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,719
which neither Britt and I really have

368
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,280
much of an eye for, I would say.

369
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,120
So, it kind of worked out really well

370
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:41,679
and we realized

371
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,279
that we really loved working

372
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,519
with each other.

373
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,359
Although that came up

374
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,159
with its ups and downs,

375
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,519
sometimes being friends.

376
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,639
Sometimes it's a little hard

377
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,475
to be transparent

378
00:10:49,675 --> 00:10:50,960
when you're giving constructive feedback

379
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,640
and that kind of stuff.

380
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,400
And it was something,

381
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,560
a challenge that we had to work around.

382
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,560
But we ended up pivoting several times

383
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,120
to try and make the magazine work.

384
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,000
So, whether that was

385
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:01,039
a website we design

386
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,279
or whether it was pivoting

387
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,599
the type of content.

388
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,799
So, Interviewing entrepreneurs

389
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,520
about their journey.

390
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,800
Let's talk about their failures.

391
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,000
And we tried to pivot

392
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:09,639
and pivot and pivot

393
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,359
and get an audience around it.

394
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,519
And what we realized was

395
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,439
just it wasn't working.

396
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,999
And this was two years in,

397
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,559
yeah, that's two and a half years in.

398
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,479
We were incubated,

399
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,959
a accelerator called the Trans Media Zone

400
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,079
at Ryerson University in Toronto.

401
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,199
And that was the point where

402
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,439
they started to kind of sit us down

403
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,470
and be like, all right,

404
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:32,319
like you guys need

405
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,959
to figure out what you're doing.

406
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,679
This is clearly isn't working.

407
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,799
Like your audience isn't growing

408
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,679
so, what can you do.

409
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,519
And at that point,

410
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,039
we had luckily started experimenting

411
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,559
with podcasting actually, as a way

412
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,519
to interview entrepreneurs,

413
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,999
and as an extension

414
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
of this online magazine thing

415
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,360
that we were trying to make.

416
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,920
And at the time,

417
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,680
I was also working full time,

418
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,560
as well as also being in school, too.

419
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,240
And while I was at my full time job,

420
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,600
I was working in business development

421
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,840
at a tech startup.

422
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,440
And what I was doing was

423
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,720
I would go find conferences

424
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,320
and then I would basically try

425
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,400
and find executives

426
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,600
and essentially hunt them down

427
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,800
at conferences to try

428
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,400
and sell them our software at the booth.

429
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,640
And that was pretty much my main role.

430
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:16,879
And I just felt it was

431
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,160
really inauthentic.

432
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,800
It was awful.

433
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,960
It was so terrible.

434
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,000
And I remember always just feeling like

435
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,920
there was something

436
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,840
that I could be doing

437
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,600
and that would create

438
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,400
a better connection with someone.

439
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,280
And that's actually where the idea

440
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,400
for branded podcasts really sparked.

441
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:32,960
Because I was like,

442
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,839
what if you could put an executive

443
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,120
and a startup in the same room together

444
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,440
and they could talk about

445
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,680
something related to it

446
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,680
and that would actually build

447
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,280
a genuine connection.

448
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,840
And so, we ended up starting

449
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,880
a show called The Tech Haus,

450
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,400
which was our first ever original podcast

451
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,480
as Origins Media House,

452
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:52,239
which is the company

453
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,039
that we eventually evolved into.

454
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,999
And that's exactly what it was.

455
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,440
We put Fortune 500 execs with startups

456
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,200
talk about the future of technology

457
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,600
and that show went okay.

458
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:05,319
It didn't do great,

459
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,399
It didn't do amazing, but still running.

460
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,120
So, that's good.

461
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,680
And while we were doing that,

462
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
we realized, oh, well, maybe

463
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,480
what's actually going

464
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,240
to make the money here is

465
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,800
if we got brands to pay us

466
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:18,319
to make their shows for us.

467
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,440
And so we pivoted again

468
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:21,119
and then eventually found our niche.

469
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,039
And the product market fit

470
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,639
was really like getting brands

471
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,599
to pay us to do full service production.

472
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,400
And that's where we found

473
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,960
our bread and butter.

474
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,640
After four long years.

475
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,640
That's a pretty fascinating thing.

476
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,960
Thank you for sharing that.

477
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,440
And I can't imagine how difficult

478
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:37,719
it must be to be co-founding a startup

479
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,479
with two of your best friends.

480
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,519
I love the pivoting.

481
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,279
I love the insights along the way.

482
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,879
It's really just

483
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,079
the pure entrepreneurial journey.

484
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,920
So thank you very, very much

485
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,880
for sharing that.

486
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,640
What do you do today

487
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,680
as head of production at Quill?

488
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,880
Yeah, so head of production is

489
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:55,639
an interesting role.

490
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,920
I would say it was a little odd

491
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,280
to transition from being a CEO into

492
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
this role today.

493
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,240
But now that it's been a few months,

494
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,760
I actually I've really enjoyed it.

495
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,240
It's great.

496
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,640
It's a lot less stress

497
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,840
and I'm really lucky to have

498
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,080
an incredible team that I work with.

499
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,840
But basically my role

500
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,480
as head of production

501
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,520
is basically to make sure

502
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,720
that a show goes

503
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,440
from initial idea and concept,

504
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,200
mapping that out,

505
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,920
making sure that there is going to be

506
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,120
an audience for it

507
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,000
as best as I can,

508
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,640
and making sure that

509
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:23,519
we're going to hit the goals

510
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,999
with the concept that we have,

511
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,919
building up the structure

512
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,159
and then basically taking that

513
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,400
and rolling it out

514
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,240
to make sure that

515
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,760
we execute it properly,

516
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,720
making sure that everything

517
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,360
gets booked in,

518
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,880
making sure that

519
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,680
the recordings go smoothly,

520
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,000
making sure that the content is

521
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,160
as good as it can be

522
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,000
in the post-production

523
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,560
and editing process.

524
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,920
And then from there,

525
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:46,159
working on distribution,

526
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,440
making sure it goes smoothly

527
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,560
onto all the platforms,

528
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,440
and then also working

529
00:14:49,441 --> 00:14:52,239
on the second half of the challenge

530
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,159
when you're creating a podcast,

531
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,480
which is audience growth.

532
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,960
So, working there

533
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,880
and figuring out, okay,

534
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,600
how do we look at the show

535
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,120
not necessarily as just a podcast,

536
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,200
an extension of a brand,

537
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:04,399
but how do we look at a podcast

538
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,719
as a brand in and of itself.

539
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,119
And so then

540
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,559
how do we grow an audience

541
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,839
and a community around that's going

542
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,880
to rally around this idea

543
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,120
which then will feed back

544
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,880
into your brand.

545
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:13,839
I think a lot of people kind

546
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,319
of look at it opposite to that.

547
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,440
And at this point,

548
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:18,479
I think we just start looking

549
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,920
at podcasts and shows as

550
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,400
brands in and of themselves.

551
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,320
That's really interesting.

552
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:26,159
I didn't think of podcasts

553
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,199
in such a way until now.

554
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,959
But it makes perfect sense

555
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,279
from the similar experience

556
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,479
that I've been having

557
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,919
with this and it's been a lot of fun.

558
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,440
So, I know quite a few people

559
00:15:34,441 --> 00:15:35,957
who are running podcasts.

560
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,039
Now that we're talking

561
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,999
about how big the market is getting.

562
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,039
I am reflecting back

563
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,079
and I'm realizing

564
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,600
that I have a lot of friends

565
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,840
that are starting podcast,

566
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:46,079
that have already been running podcasts.

567
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,480
What are some high level

568
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,160
or low level pointers

569
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,103
that we can provide to some of

570
00:15:52,303 --> 00:15:54,240
to myself and some of my friends

571
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,720
on how to create a successful podcast?

572
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:58,599
And when I say successful,

573
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,079
I mean engaging with

574
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,040
the right audience

575
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,520
and having speaking to them

576
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,840
and having them really interact

577
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,480
with the content.

578
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,240
Oh, yes. I love this question.

579
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,360
So, there's a couple of different ways.

580
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:11,919
And I always say

581
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,079
it's almost like a road map

582
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,879
that you should follow.

583
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,559
And I actually pretty much stole this

584
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,999
from building a business.

585
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,519
But basically what you need to do,

586
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,039
it's the first thing when you're starting

587
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,759
a podcast is think about

588
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,479
what are you trying

589
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,559
to actually achieve.

590
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,199
I think a lot of people,

591
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,239
when they're starting a show,

592
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,959
they're like, oh yeah.

593
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,999
I'm just going to start a show

594
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,319
and it'll be a fun side hustle.

595
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,160
And it's like, okay, cool.

596
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:33,679
But like, what's the point?

597
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,199
At the end of the day,

598
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,519
when things are really hard

599
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,320
and you're going to have

600
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:38,759
to edit for hours to make sure

601
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,079
that the show gets out on time,

602
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,719
what's going to make you go back to it

603
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,359
and say, yes, this is worth it.

604
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:43,559
Right?

605
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,359
Because if you don't have that thing

606
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,919
that is telling you that your show

607
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,919
is worth doing

608
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,599
and the time that you're putting into it

609
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,679
is worth doing,

610
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,359
then your show is going to flop.

611
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,639
Because you're going to do maybe

612
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,559
five to 10 episodes.

613
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,119
You're going to be like,

614
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,999
this is a lot of work.

615
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,800
And that's going to be that.

616
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,880
Unless you go and hire someone,

617
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:01,079
which most indie podcasters won't,

618
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,680
because this is generally

619
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,560
can be very expensive to hire someone

620
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,920
unless you're just doing parts

621
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,840
of the process, maybe like

622
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,960
you're outsourcing another here.

623
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,920
But anyways, so, first things first.

624
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,680
Start with the goal.

625
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:13,079
Next, what you want to do

626
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,439
is you want to think about your ILP

627
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,399
or your Ideal Listener Profile.

628
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,039
And so full disclosure,

629
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,959
I fully stole this

630
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,880
from ideal customer profile.

631
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:24,839
But what you want to do is map out

632
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,399
who exactly your target listener is.

633
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,959
So, who are they,

634
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,039
what age are they,

635
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,239
what gender are they,

636
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,279
what are their hobbies,

637
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,239
what are their interests,

638
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,159
why do they want to listen

639
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,079
to this podcast,

640
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,319
what are their motivators in life, like,

641
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,360
what do they need to hear from you.

642
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,800
Essentially, what are their

643
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,880
behaviors every day,

644
00:17:44,881 --> 00:17:45,879
like what are their hobbies.

645
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,320
I want to know all of that.

646
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,960
Because then when you're talking

647
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,040
and shaping the content

648
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,960
and the structure,

649
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,840
you're going to know what's going

650
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,960
to engage them better because

651
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
you're thinking of it from

652
00:17:53,961 --> 00:17:56,279
a listeners first standpoint.

653
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,519
And a lot of podcasters

654
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,439
that I think also start

655
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,399
from this place of

656
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,599
I'm going to start with me

657
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,319
and I'm going to start

658
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,039
with my content

659
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,920
and what I want,

660
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:04,199
instead of thinking about,

661
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,799
well, what do the listeners want,

662
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,079
what does the audience want.

663
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,279
Right?

664
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,119
And just like a company,

665
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,399
if you start a company

666
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:10,959
and you say,

667
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,051
I want to build a product

668
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:13,480
because I like it

669
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,400
and you're not considering

670
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
what your customers want,

671
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,560
it's not going to be very successful.

672
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:16,960
Right?

673
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,680
And so, it's the same thing

674
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,400
with podcasting.

675
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,000
You have to look at it

676
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,960
from a listener standpoint.

677
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,240
Your listeners are your customers

678
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,320
at the end of the day.

679
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,720
And then from there,

680
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,800
once you have kind of like

681
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,280
your ideal listener profile mapped out,

682
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,920
can be like a two pager, it's fine.

683
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,600
One pager even.

684
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:34,239
Then, what I like to do

685
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,200
and what we do at Quill

686
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,720
is we do a positioning

687
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,760
or a competitive matrix.

688
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,880
So, take a look at

689
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,600
the type of show that

690
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,080
you're thinking you're going to create. Right?

691
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:43,599
By this point,

692
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,599
you kind of probably thinking

693
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,399
you have a concept,

694
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,999
you know what category it's going to be.

695
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,399
Let's say

696
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,919
it's an entrepreneurship podcast

697
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,999
like this one.

698
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,359
And look at the category.

699
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,799
So the entrepreneurship category

700
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,319
on Apple will be like, okay,

701
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,599
what are the top podcasts in my category.

702
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,840
Map it out,

703
00:18:57,841 --> 00:19:00,319
maybe do like six or seven.

704
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,679
However many you want.

705
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,999
And then take a look

706
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,039
and think about them

707
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,559
in terms of show duration,

708
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,239
in terms of post engagement,

709
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,800
think about their structure

710
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,880
and rip them apart and be like, okay,

711
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,480
what did I do really, really well

712
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,360
and what did I not do really well.

713
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,200
What did I not engage with

714
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,040
and then map it all out

715
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,440
and find the patterns.

716
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,840
So, find the patterns of what

717
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,000
they're all not doing well

718
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,840
or what listeners aren't

719
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,360
necessarily getting from the top shows

720
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,280
in your category

721
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,760
and then provide that value.

722
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,600
So, that's basically my philosophy

723
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,799
on how to create a successful show,

724
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,840
because once you have all

725
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,880
of those pieces together,

726
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,840
you can map out a structure

727
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,760
that's going to be effective

728
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,480
and engaging for your listeners.

729
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,080
And also, just another side note,

730
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,200
a lot of people also that

731
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,600
I've met that are doing podcasts,

732
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,120
generally, people think of it as a sprint

733
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,440
and not a marathon.

734
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,840
And podcasting,

735
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:52,399
when you put out your first episode,

736
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,439
it's okay to have fifty listeners.

737
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,159
You're not going

738
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,839
to have thousands and thousands

739
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,559
of people listening

740
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,720
to you right off the bat.

741
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,200
That's totally fine because

742
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:01,959
listeners accumulate over time.

743
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,559
The whole idea of podcast

744
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,199
is you need to be consistent

745
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,599
and constantly putting episode out,

746
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,119
episode out, episodes out.

747
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,799
Right?

748
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,920
And then your audience

749
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,280
will build over time

750
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,760
as people discover you,

751
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,800
as you get more guys,

752
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,280
as you get more exposure.

753
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,680
And so just because

754
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:18,199
you put out 10 episodes

755
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,119
and maybe you only have like

756
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,080
3,000 listeners on the entire show.

757
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:23,639
That's actually not necessarily

758
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,559
a bad thing,

759
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,479
just keep going and keep going,

760
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,800
and then eventually

761
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:29,214
you'll do 20 and then maybe you'll have

762
00:20:29,215 --> 00:20:31,239
6,000 or even 10,000 by then.

763
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,160
And then that's metrics

764
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:33,253
that you can get behind

765
00:20:33,254 --> 00:20:34,480
and you can present to sponsors,

766
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:36,039
if that's what you're looking for.

767
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,999
So, yeah, that's basically

768
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,999
my general advice for podcasting.

769
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,329
I think

770
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,399
I'm definitely going to take that to heart.

771
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,119
And obviously,

772
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,759
even once you have the whole structure

773
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,279
in the envelope around it,

774
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,375
you still do the hard work

775
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:49,422
of actually producing quality content

776
00:20:49,423 --> 00:20:50,199
and having fun.

777
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,307
And I think that

778
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:53,398
when I thought about going into

779
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:54,639
this project myself,

780
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,980
I never thought of it as quitting

781
00:20:55,981 --> 00:20:57,199
a podcast or quitting a show.

782
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,439
I thought of it,

783
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,528
how can I engage

784
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:02,444
with really interesting  people

785
00:21:02,445 --> 00:21:04,824
in all sorts of industries

786
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:05,816
and get their nuggets

787
00:21:05,817 --> 00:21:07,131
and insights from their life.

788
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,943
Things that I am truly interested in,

789
00:21:08,944 --> 00:21:10,943
having a truly fascinating

790
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:12,239
conversation for me.

791
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,719
And, you know, by association,

792
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,757
a lot of my friends

793
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:17,557
that are also like minded with me,

794
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:18,999
will also be interested.

795
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
But Steph, I really want

796
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:20,959
to thank you for being

797
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,399
so generous with your time.

798
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,612
It's been really, really wonderful

799
00:21:23,613 --> 00:21:24,359
and very insightful.

800
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,119
So thank you.

801
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,959
And before we leave,

802
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,239
I have to ask you for three words

803
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,720
that you would use to describe yourself.

804
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,839
Oh, Lord, I have to think about it.

805
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,399
Even though I've had like a full half

806
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,235
and an hour to think about it

807
00:21:36,236 --> 00:21:37,337
because you told me

808
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,959
that you would ask this question.

809
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,799
All right.

810
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,929
So, I'd say the first word.

811
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,799
Oh, Okay.

812
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,640
I'd say the first word is probably,

813
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,243
ambitious, I guess.

814
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,360
The second word I would say

815
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:57,359
is connected.

816
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,359
I generally like not connected

817
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,679
in the sense of being well connected.

818
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,399
But I would say my biggest

819
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,359
curiosity in life is how people connect

820
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:05,971
to one another

821
00:22:05,972 --> 00:22:06,986
and how we connect

822
00:22:06,987 --> 00:22:08,714
to the world around us.

823
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,759
So, I'd say that's a big one for me.

824
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,359
And the third one,

825
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:18,679
I would say quirky, I guess.

826
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,119
I don't know.

827
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,799
I love that.

828
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,439
People have told me that a lot.

829
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,719
So there you go.

830
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,559
That's perfect.

831
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,279
Steph, thank you very much.

832
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,600
Stay safe and stay healthy.

833
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,679
Thank you.

834
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,800
Yes, you too. Thank you.
