1
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,520
Wonderful.

2
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,880
Dennis Cagan, thank you so much

3
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,560
for being on my show.

4
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,480
How are you?

5
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,720
I'm good. Thank you, Michael.

6
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,680
How are you?

7
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,560
Wonderful.

8
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,120
Where are you calling from?

9
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,360
I'm in a suburb of Dallas, Texas.

10
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,080
Wonderful.

11
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,680
Okay. I'm actually going to Texas

12
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,400
just in a few days

13
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,280
to see my brother's newborn.

14
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,400
So third time uncle and

15
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,040
I'm very very excited.

16
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,400
What city?

17
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh, in San Antonio.

18
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,480
Okay.

19
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,960
So, not too far.

20
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
But what I'm very excited to talk to you

21
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,560
in these next 20 minutes or so

22
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,720
is the fact that you've been a part of

23
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,040
I think 67 for profit board of directors,

24
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,400
mostly tech companies.

25
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,760
And I don't think I've met anybody

26
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,000
who was on 67 boards.

27
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,840
So, I'm very excited to talk

28
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,560
in the next 20 minutes

29
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,960
about what it means to be a board member

30
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,400
and what is the role of a board

31
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,880
of a for profit company.

32
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,640
But aside from that, a published author,

33
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
an instructor in a business school.

34
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
So Dennis, I would love for you

35
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,520
to just give me a really brief intro

36
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,400
to your journey.

37
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,920
How do you get to be on 67 seats

38
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,520
in tech companies?

39
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,640
Well, I started working for IBM in 1967

40
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,520
and I hold some kind of a record.

41
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,720
I worked for IBM for 366 days exactly.

42
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,440
I quit one year to the day

43
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,360
when I started

44
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,960
because I realized that big company

45
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,760
wasn't for me.

46
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,920
But I was already sort of

47
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,600
in the computer industry,

48
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
obviously in the '60s.

49
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,880
Then I got a job

50
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,920
selling computer time sharing,

51
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,160
and I realized that the customers

52
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,480
I was trying to sell to didn't know

53
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,000
what to do with a computer.

54
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,400
They liked the idea of time sharing

55
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,720
and remote computing,

56
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
but they didn't know what to do.

57
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,560
So, two of my buddies who were engineers

58
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,520
and I, started our first company,

59
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,640
my first company.

60
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,080
And it was a remote access

61
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,240
computing application software company.

62
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,920
And we started it in 1968.

63
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,120
1968 for remote access computing?

64
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,280
That's right. Application software.

65
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,720
That's before the Internet.

66
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,480
Long before the Internet.

67
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,680
And so, and I was an avid reader.

68
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,800
I read the Wall Street Journal,

69
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,760
Business Week, Forbes,

70
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,640
and Fortune, not much else.

71
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,720
So I knew if you had a company

72
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,800
you were supposed to have a board.

73
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,240
So, we had a board.

74
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,280
We created a board.

75
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,760
So, that was my first board.

76
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,480
And then every company I started,

77
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,560
I've started about 18 or founded or co-founded about 18 companies,

78
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,960
mostly tech.

79
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,600
Every single one after that had a board.

80
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,480
So by the time, time passed,

81
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,160
people that I was in business with

82
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,280
knew me as having a board.

83
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,040
So, whenever they thought about a board,

84
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,200
the only person they knew

85
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,320
that was on one was me.

86
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,400
So, I got a lot of questions.

87
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,120
So, that's how I got involved

88
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,800
in one company after another. They said,

89
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,280
"Well, what does a board do?"

90
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,520
And I would talk about it.

91
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:30,800
And they said,

92
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,760
"Well, would you help me?

93
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,880
Would you be on the board?"

94
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,040
And that's still happening today.

95
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,560
Okay. So, that's how you get introduced

96
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,920
to 67 different board positions.

97
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,560
But when thinking a bit more broadly

98
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,560
about the role of the board of directors,

99
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,760
that's not a controversial topic, right?

100
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,200
I mean, growing up

101
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,040
as a young entrepreneur now,

102
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,320
it's very natural for me

103
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,880
to understand that

104
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,680
Yeah, every group that has

105
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,400
some difficult decision making processes

106
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,560
needs this other group who will oversee it

107
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,120
and sort of strategically think

108
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,040
what is the best way to get

109
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,840
from point A to point B?

110
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,960
Well yes, but you seem to be a step ahead

111
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,040
of most young entrepreneurs.

112
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,160
Most of them recognize,

113
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,040
Well yeah, I have a board,

114
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,280
but me and my partner are fine.

115
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,560
We don't need any other advice

116
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,000
or we don't want

117
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
to get anybody involved

118
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,720
because we're afraid.

119
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,920
What if they get control,

120
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,600
and what if we have to listen to them.

121
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,360
And there's a lot of different arguments

122
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,000
and questions.

123
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,040
So they're not as educated as you are.

124
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,160
The primary reason, if you have a company,

125
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,320
you have a board by default, legally.

126
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,680
Right right. In the bylaws. Right.

127
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,240
It may be just you, but you've got one, okay.

128
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,760
Right.

129
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,520
If it's just you, or just insiders,

130
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,680
you're getting the opinion

131
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,360
and the guidance of insiders,

132
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,480
employees and family and whatnot,

133
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,320
you get their guidance anyway.

134
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,040
They're not bringing

135
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,440
anything new to the party.

136
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,480
The reason to have a board

137
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,240
is to expand the perspective

138
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,840
that you're getting to include

139
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,240
highly capable other people

140
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,840
that you respect

141
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,000
who can give you a different perspective,

142
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,840
different experience, different context

143
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,400
than you already possess

144
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,840
to expand your capability.

145
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,880
So, it's like going out

146
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,200
and bringing on some other people

147
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,480
who are highly regarded in their fields

148
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,360
as consultants, so to speak.

149
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:14,880
Right.

150
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,160
And if you have a private company,

151
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,120
people don't understand.

152
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,080
The CEO reports to the board.

153
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,200
If you're the board,

154
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,240
then you report to yourself, okay?

155
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:25,520
Right.

156
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,640
But even if you were

157
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,120
the only person inside

158
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,480
or on a seven person board

159
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,920
and you had six other people on the board,

160
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,840
and they all voted against you,

161
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,560
if you own controlling interest,

162
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
you just call a meeting and fire 'em,

163
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,240
or you do whatever you want anyway.

164
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,560
If you ... the board reports

165
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,320
to the owners

166
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,400
even though the CEO reports to the board-

167
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,080
So, but Dennis, when I'm thinking about this,

168
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,400
it makes perfect sense.

169
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,840
But there must be some conflict

170
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,080
that sometimes getting a board too early

171
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,240
invested in the company

172
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,680
and too many different ideas

173
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,080
and different perspectives too early

174
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,320
can actually be detrimental

175
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,280
to your progress,

176
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,360
because in my mind,

177
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,520
you're starting a company.

178
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,120
The earlier you are,

179
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,440
the faster you have to move

180
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,640
in order to prove yourself

181
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,560
and to sort of break things, right?

182
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,480
And having more people involved

183
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,600
in the decision making processes

184
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,960
can just make it more difficult.

185
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,400
So, is there a sweet spot

186
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,760
from your perspective on

187
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,680
when it's the right time to have

188
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,960
external people coming in

189
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,760
with their specialty and expertise?

190
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,480
The issue that you're alluding to

191
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,200
is really a factor

192
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,360
of who those people are,

193
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,440
not whether you have 'em or not.

194
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,840
And so, at an early stage,

195
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,480
if you could afford to hire

196
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,800
six of the top people in the country

197
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,440
in certain fields like sales, finance,

198
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,480
marketing, manufacturing,

199
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,720
software development, whatever it is.

200
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,840
If you could afford to hire

201
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,560
six people like that and you would,

202
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,680
then why wouldn't you get

203
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,640
those same types of people,

204
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,400
if not the same people,

205
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,840
to join the board for a few stock options

206
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,560
and get their advice and their input.

207
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,680
Because isn't a board much longer term

208
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,560
that you're saying, you're sort of committing

209
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,200
to have this person a part of your journey

210
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,400
for many years down the line?

211
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,760
Well, that's a good question.

212
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,640
The board is not a lifetime position.

213
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,560
And companies, particularly

214
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,520
in the early stage,

215
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,120
they tend to evolve quickly.

216
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,440
So, the best you might be able to do

217
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,160
is get somebody

218
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,040
who used to be a director of something

219
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,360
at a big company.

220
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,560
But you grow a little

221
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,360
and you gain a little bit more experience

222
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,280
and your company becomes

223
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,400
a little bit more valuable, so to speak,

224
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,440
then you might be able to approach

225
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,360
somebody that has more experience,

226
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,800
is more accomplished.

227
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,070
But what happens to that first person?

228
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,280
You cordially ask them to resign.

229
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,960
You give them their stock options,

230
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,680
and you move on, you cycle through.

231
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,920
Is that common to cycle through

232
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,050
and ask board members to leave?

233
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,160
It's not common enough.

234
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,360
Too many people think

235
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,040
Well, I've committed to them.

236
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,320
I don't want to get rid of them.

237
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,360
Now, one mechanism that most companies use

238
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,480
to avoid that problem

239
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,160
is they have terms.

240
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,520
Like a one year board term,

241
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,440
or a two year board term,

242
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,360
or something like that.

243
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,240
And so, even if

244
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,760
they don't like the person,

245
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,720
they're reticent to ask them to resign

246
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,880
even in a very cordial way.

247
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,040
So they, well, we'll live with this person

248
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,120
even though they're disruptive

249
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,840
and their advise isn't

250
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,760
any good anymore

251
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,240
because in a year and a half,

252
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,280
they'll be off the board anyway.

253
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,040
No, that's wrong.

254
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,120
Make arrangements

255
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,560
for them to leave the board

256
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,040
if they're not doing what you-

257
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,000
That's fascinating. Okay.

258
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,800
I don't think I, in all the board

259
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,440
discussions that I've had around

260
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,880
about the strategy behind

261
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,280
structuring for a board and so on,

262
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,400
very rarely I hear about this, what to do

263
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,000
when you don't have a successful board.

264
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,560
And what I'd love to spend some time on

265
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,680
with you, Dennis, is to get sort of your

266
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,680
to pick your brain on your experiences

267
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,800
and what are some of the most

268
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,040
successful parts of the board

269
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,600
and the least successful parts

270
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,800
of the board experience,

271
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,320
so that I can learn

272
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,640
from your personal experiences.

273
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,560
Well, the best part of a board is that

274
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,920
you receive first class advice

275
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,760
from experienced experts

276
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,360
particularly in areas

277
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,320
that you may not be as competent in,

278
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,240
or you may not have other people

279
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,760
involved in your company

280
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,760
that know a lot about that.

281
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,880
In the early days,

282
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,960
you may not be able to afford a CFO.

283
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,760
So, having an experienced CFO

284
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,920
gives you a financial perspective.

285
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,880
Maybe you can't

286
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,840
Maybe there's nobody in the company

287
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,400
that has big time CEO experience.

288
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,560
So, having a big time CEO

289
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,960
might give you the benefit.

290
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,520
So, you're receiving best of class advice.

291
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,600
Number two, no one person

292
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,000
can think of everything.

293
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,720
And so, by getting together

294
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,960
with a capable group of board members,

295
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,680
men and women and so forth,

296
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,640
then you're likely to get

297
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,920
fresh perspective, innovative ideas,

298
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,400
that you didn't already think

299
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,560
about yourself. Like,

300
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,600
Whoa, I never thought of that.

301
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,320
Particularly board members

302
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,360
are very good in one industry of saying,

303
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,240
"Well in my business,

304
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,680
when we face problems,

305
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,880
we did this and this and this"

306
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,320
And it might not be common

307
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,400
in your business,

308
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,440
but they bring a perspective of things

309
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,360
in other industries,

310
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,120
in other countries, or whatever,

311
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,480
that may have worked well for them.

312
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,040
And it may spark an idea.

313
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,080
It really, it's using the board

314
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,560
as a competitive advantage,

315
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,280
giving you an inside track.

316
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,520
The next thing is, that it can provide

317
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,360
very very impressive optics

318
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,240
for customers, for vendors,

319
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,160
for investors.

320
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,600
I've put people on the board

321
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,640
that people said,

322
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,160
"How did you ever get a person like that

323
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,240
on the board of a startup

324
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,680
that had no revenue?"

325
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,480
I mean, world renowned CEOs

326
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,560
and four star admirals

327
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,360
and all kinds of key.

328
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,280
I got the guy that had been

329
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,080
previously the director of the NSA

330
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,880
to join the board

331
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,120
of a cybersecurity software startup.

332
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,520
So, you don't know who you can get.

333
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,600
I recruited a guy

334
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,720
to one of my boards

335
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,520
a number of years ago,

336
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,080
like 15, 16 years ago,

337
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,720
he's still on the board. He had to retire

338
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,280
because he reached a retirement age.

339
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,480
So, he had been on the board

340
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,800
of General Motors, Raytheon,

341
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,400
Hewlett-Packard, and Hughes electronics

342
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,920
for four years,

343
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,560
and he was previously

344
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,800
the president of Caltech.

345
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,040
And he joined the board of a startup

346
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,600
for some stock options.

347
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,200
And he's still on the board today.

348
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,320
It's not a startup anymore,

349
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,720
but he's still on the board today.

350
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,040
His experience and connections

351
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,120
were invaluable to the company.

352
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,520
And he's just one of a number

353
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,200
of board members over the years.

354
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,320
You don't know who you could get

355
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,440
until you try.

356
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,640
It's an honor to be asked

357
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,600
even if it's not something

358
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,680
that you would consider

359
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
for a variety of reasons.

360
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,360
So it gives you, and then

361
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,600
if you're an early stage company,

362
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,160
and you're completely controlled

363
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,200
by insiders,

364
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,000
whether it's a family business

365
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,440
or whether it's a tech startup

366
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,040
and you've got one or two

367
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
or three founders,

368
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,000
having independent board members

369
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,920
provides a good buffer

370
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,040
between disagreements.

371
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,880
An independent board member

372
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,280
can mitigate issues between founders,

373
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,320
whether they're family issues,

374
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,480
or founder issues,

375
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,680
and give some perspective.

376
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,720
Like, "Hey Sam. You know,

377
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,520
Bill's got a good point there.

378
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,040
Have you considered this or this"

379
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,280
So that they can soften the kind of conflict

380
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,480
that founders often have.

381
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,440
So, what I'm hearing from this is that

382
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,280
So there's two

383
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,400
really critical lessons there.

384
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,440
One of them is to approach.

385
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,320
Not be afraid, shoot for the stars,

386
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,240
approach the people.

387
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,520
Even if they don't have time,

388
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,680
they'll be honored for asking.

389
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,280
Even if they were

390
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,040
the previous president of Caltech.

391
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,720
And worst case, you'll get a "No.

392
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,600
Talk to me later in a different time"

393
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,080
Right?

394
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,680
The second lesson here is

395
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,040
that you want to make sure

396
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,480
that your board members

397
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,360
are as independent

398
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,560
of a relationship with you as possible,

399
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,760
because they will then

400
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,880
be able to help you go

401
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,520
help mediate through conflicts.

402
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,360
And even if you and your co-founders

403
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,760
are the best coworkers in the world

404
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,600
and you get each other,

405
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,320
conflicts are inevitable.

406
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,200
The decision making will be difficult,

407
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,480
and having somebody independent

408
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,880
will be very useful for those moments

409
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,160
where emotions might kick in

410
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,000
or there's really a vehement disagreement

411
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,840
over something, right?

412
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:33,720
So, I recruited once the founder,

413
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,200
chairman, and CEO

414
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,200
of one of the five largest tech companies

415
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,760
in the United States to a board

416
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,440
of people he didn't ever know,

417
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,680
in a city that he wasn't in,

418
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,520
but he was interested in their business

419
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,040
so he agreed to join the board.

420
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,320
Now, he was the CEO and chairman

421
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,040
of the company up until the time

422
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,760
it went public originally.

423
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,680
Then he retired.

424
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,360
But on a growing tech company,

425
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,360
that had some similarities to his,

426
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,760
he regretted not staying with the company

427
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,600
after it went public.

428
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,840
It's a very very very famous company.

429
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,600
He left when it went public,

430
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,440
but he never took it from that point

431
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,200
to where it is now.

432
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,360
So he regretted that.

433
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,200
So the opportunity

434
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,240
to join the board of a company

435
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,120
where his input might be beneficial

436
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,360
to get them to the next point

437
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,320
was just a way

438
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,840
that he could participate again

439
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,040
and sort of contribute something.

440
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,120
So, you don't know,

441
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,800
you don't have any idea

442
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,400
the types of people you can get.

443
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,040
Now, it's a chance to interview somebody

444
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
even if they don't agree

445
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,080
to join the board. And even if

446
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,560
they don't want to join your board they're,

447
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,880
the likelihood is they're gonna say,

448
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,320
"You know, I can't do it

449
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,160
for these reasons,

450
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,320
but I know somebody else

451
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,320
that might be interested."

452
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,720
And then you get a recommendation

453
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,920
to them from this person.

454
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,080
Right. Definitely.

455
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,600
Okay. So, looking back

456
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,360
at these 67 board positions,

457
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,160
what are some of the key things

458
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,880
or key takeaways that you take

459
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,160
from having a successful

460
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,240
group of board members?

461
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,400
I get why specific individuals

462
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,240
will be great for the company

463
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
and for the team.

464
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,880
But at the end, when I think

465
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,960
of a board of a company,

466
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,920
I think of about seven, eight people

467
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,920
sitting around a table

468
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,800
and each of them alone

469
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,920
is a superstar perhaps,

470
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,040
but together, they have to work together

471
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,920
to make some decisions, right.

472
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,520
A lot of the time

473
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,880
there's voting decisions.

474
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,760
So, what makes a successful

475
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,200
group of board members

476
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,760
rather than an individual?

477
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:36,360
Well as I think you know, in 2012 I thought,

478
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,240
What is it that I know more

479
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,160
about than most people?

480
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,240
I'm a okay CEO, I'm okay at this,

481
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,800
okay at that,

482
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,640
but I'm not the world's best at this.

483
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,480
But what can I claim that I know as much

484
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,720
or more than anybody about?

485
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,320
And it dawned on me, this was in 2012,

486
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,680
that it's private companies

487
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,360
and boards of directors.

488
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,680
And so, that's when I decided

489
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,320
to write my book,

490
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,880
which was published in 2012,

491
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,920
"The Board of Directors

492
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,440
of a Private Enterprise"

493
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,160
And in that book,

494
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,640
there's a chapter, for example,

495
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,800
there's a chapter

496
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,400
on how to fire board members.

497
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,480
As you said, nobody ever talks about it,

498
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,680
but it tells you how and why

499
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,680
to fire board members,

500
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,040
and how to do it successfully.

501
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,720
There's also a chapter about personalities

502
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,720
and things that contribute

503
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,800
to bad boards or good boards.

504
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,240
And that's where you're going now.

505
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,040
So, for example, in there

506
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,360
I have a list of things

507
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,800
that most people never think about

508
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,000
when they recruit a board member.

509
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,640
They think, "Well I need a CEO,

510
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,920
or I need a CFO,

511
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,880
or I need a technology expert,

512
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,280
or I need this or that"

513
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,160
What are some of the things

514
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,120
they never think of?

515
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,040
They never ever say,

516
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,080
Well, I need somebody

517
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,480
that has a great sense of humor.

518
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,440
Or they might think,

519
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,360
Well, I need somebody

520
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,760
that's collaborative.

521
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,800
Or I need somebody

522
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,400
that can park their ego at the door.
- Right.

523
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Or there's personality traits

524
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,760
you're bringing a bunch of type As

525
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,520
to the board, you want to make sure

526
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,400
that they can subjugate their own egos

527
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,520
and listen and focus their energies

528
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,960
for a reasonably limited amount of time

529
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,080
each month or each quarter

530
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,600
on solving the problems of somebody else.

531
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,560
And they need to be able to work together.

532
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,880
If they all have to jump up

533
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,000
on their soapbox and lecture each other.

534
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,200
You can imagine if you got five top CEOs

535
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,240
all in a room, not listening to each other,

536
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,640
but just lecturing each other,

537
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,040
you're not gonna accomplish anything.

538
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,320
So, those people aren't suitable.

539
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,760
And what I tell people is that

540
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,280
they're, depending on what you need

541
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,880
for your board,

542
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,880
you should be filling roles in the board

543
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,880
that are important things for you,

544
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,280
but that you don't feel

545
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,960
are adequately represented

546
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,160
within your employees

547
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,320
and within your other close associates.

548
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,040
What expertise don't they have.

549
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,160
But then I'll tell people

550
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,160
There may be 10 people that are qualified,

551
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
maybe 100 people that are qualified

552
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,240
to fill that role in your board,

553
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,640
but there may be only one or two

554
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,600
that are suitable.

555
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
Qualified isn't suitable.

556
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,120
What's their personality?

557
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,000
How does it mesh with your culture?

558
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,200
'cause the right board

559
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,200
would be listening, giving their input,

560
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,720
not repeating.

561
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,920
One of my favorite things

562
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,880
that I've learned

563
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,480
from this one guy I mentioned

564
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,680
who had been on all those big boards

565
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,360
is that when the CEO says,

566
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,120
"Okay, well what do you think about this?

567
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,040
What do you think about this?

568
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,800
What do you think about this?"

569
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,440
He goes to each board member.

570
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,920
When it gets to this board member,

571
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,000
if he doesn't have

572
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,720
something different to say,

573
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,280
something that has not been said before,

574
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,000
he'll say, "I agree with what she said"

575
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,280
And that's it.

576
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,800
He doesn't have to get up

577
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,480
on a chair and say,

578
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,200
"Well, I think"

579
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:53,920
and then repeat

580
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,400
what everybody else has already said.

581
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,200
Is that something very common with boards,

582
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
that you end up having ego struggles

583
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,760
rather than solving the actual problem?

584
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,600
Yes, particularly if they haven't been

585
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,800
put together by somebody

586
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,920
that has some experience

587
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,960
or some sensitivity.

588
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,160
That can be very very common.

589
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,520
One time, I had spun a company,

590
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,560
I have another company.

591
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,360
I found a CEO. I set it up.

592
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,800
We moved it to another location.

593
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,680
Later on, that company's now

594
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,880
was bought about two years ago

595
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,120
for about five or $600 million.

596
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,600
But when we brought in

597
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,960
our second round of venture investors,

598
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,720
the first board meeting we had

599
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,080
with the new venture capital investors,

600
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,480
we were standing around in the boardroom

601
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,640
with all the management

602
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,480
and the board members

603
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,840
and the previous investors

604
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,800
that were on the board.

605
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,040
And this guy walked in.

606
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,680
And I was having a conversation

607
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,320
with the CFO at the time.

608
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,520
And this new investor,

609
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,520
venture capital investor,

610
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,280
walked in the room.

611
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,360
And he walked around the room

612
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,760
talking to each group,

613
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,360
shaking their hand,

614
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,520
and very very unusual body language.

615
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,120
So, the CFO turns to me and says,

616
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,880
"What is he doing?"

617
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,400
And I said,

618
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,920
"Oh, don't mind him.

619
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,280
He's just urinating

620
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,360
in all four corners of the room

621
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,720
so that everybody knows

622
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,920
who owns the company now"

623
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,440
Okay. That's not gonna be

624
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
a productive board member.

625
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,080
In this case, they had no choice.

626
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,520
He was the lead investor.

627
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,080
However, they also didn't do

628
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,400
their proper diligence

629
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,920
in selecting who was gonna be

630
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,600
that investor to find out, well

631
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,200
who was gonna be on the board.

632
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,080
And I've had CEOs that said,

633
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,840
"Well, I prefer

634
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,800
these two venture capital companies,

635
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,920
'cause they know more about my business"

636
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,920
where I told the CEO, "No.

637
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,880
They have a history of being interfering

638
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,080
and not collaborative.

639
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,880
Even though you think they know more,

640
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,600
I would suggest

641
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,280
these other two venture capitalists,

642
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,640
because they have a history

643
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,840
of being very supportive of founders

644
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,760
and management,

645
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,880
even in tough circumstances"

646
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,520
And the CEO went with his own choice,

647
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,240
and within a year and a half,

648
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,280
they had taken the company away from him.

649
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,480
They had booted him out.

650
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,520
Wow. Okay, Dennis,

651
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,800
I feel like I'm in the middle

652
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,600
of business school here.

653
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,720
This is incredible. And the lesson

654
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,800
that I'm taking from this here is that

655
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,960
at the end, if you're building a company,

656
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,320
it's your baby. You're working so hard

657
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,720
to make it successful.

658
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,360
Sometimes, we get blinded

659
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,520
by the term sheets that we get

660
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,760
or by the names of the ventures.

661
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,040
And we forget to do

662
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,160
the real due diligence,

663
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,760
our due diligence on them,

664
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,600
and understanding

665
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,440
how are they going to ... partner with us

666
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,840
beyond the wiring of the funds

667
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,080
to help us ... burn rate.

668
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,600
How are they going to help us

669
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,840
make the expenses

670
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,400
and to reach our milestones?

671
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,520
And it sounds like really

672
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,840
the most important way to do this is

673
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,800
to actually learn from their experience.

674
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,960
Not ask them how they are on board seats,

675
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,480
but ask other people who they've been

676
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,120
on board seats and get their perspective,

677
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,200
because you can't find this stuff

678
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:49,880
on Crunchbase,

679
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,120
you can't find it on TechCrunch, right?

680
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,920
This is all internal.

681
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,680
Also, one of the things

682
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,080
that I spend the most time doing

683
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,440
with early stage companies

684
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,040
is preparing their incorporation

685
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,800
and their governance processes

686
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,560
so that investors can't come in

687
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,280
and get control of the company.

688
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,360
There's a number of things

689
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,080
that can be done early on

690
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,600
that can make it difficult for an,

691
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,280
even if an investor gets voting control,

692
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,960
there are things that can be done

693
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,320
earlier on, not at the last minute

694
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,240
but earlier on, that can make it

695
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,520
very difficult for them

696
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,120
to get voting control

697
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,440
beyond just getting 10 votes per share,

698
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,200
or like in Snapchat's case,

699
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,080
no votes for any public shareholders.

700
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,480
There's other more subtle things

701
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,040
that can be done,

702
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,960
but nobody tells the founders

703
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,960
how to do that.

704
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,000
The idea you asked

705
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,240
"When do you bring on a board?"

706
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,400
You definitely bring on a board

707
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,640
before you bring on investors

708
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,400
that are going to want to be on the board.

709
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:44,920
Right.

710
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,280
You want to form the board

711
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,800
the way it's best for you,

712
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,400
then you want to add

713
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,240
your institutional investors

714
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,720
to that board.

715
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,640
Many people say,

716
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,880
"Well, I'll form a board

717
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,480
and I'll get a stock option plan

718
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,080
as soon as I get investors"

719
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,680
That's too late,

720
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,600
because once you get investors,

721
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,880
they then have a say so

722
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,720
as to who and how many are on your board.

723
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,840
If you do it the way

724
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,280
that you want to do it first

725
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,440
and they join the board,

726
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,680
then they're joining an existing board.

727
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,240
It's a much different dynamic

728
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:15,960
because the favorite

729
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,560
venture capital board

730
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,200
is two VCs and a founder.

731
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,240
My favorite

732
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,920
venture capital board optimally

733
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,040
is seven board members:

734
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,320
the founder, five or two founders,

735
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,360
five or six outside,

736
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,840
four or five outside ...

737
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,560
and then the venture capital

738
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,880
joins a board like that,

739
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,000
and they don't dominate the company

740
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,320
no matter what their equity.

741
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,840
And you've already set

742
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,160
the expectations and the culture

743
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,960
for the actual board meetings.
- Exactly

744
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,640
So, they're not coming in

745
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,720
and dictating how they want.

746
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,160
Dennis, this was so enjoyable.

747
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,120
Thank you so much again

748
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,720
for your generosity with your time

749
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,440
and the inspiration.

750
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,880
Before we leave, I have to ask you

751
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,200
for three words that you would use

752
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,440
to describe yourself.

753
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,160
Well, I think that it comes down to

754
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,840
First of all, at heart,

755
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,480
going back to 1968,

756
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,880
I'm an entrepreneur.

757
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,080
Yeah.

758
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,200
The second thing is that I'm really,

759
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,680
although my major in college

760
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,640
was economics,

761
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,680
I'm really a tech guy.

762
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,080
Starting with IBM and all the way through.

763
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,200
I'm really favorably

764
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,680
inclined towards technology.

765
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,200
All kinds, but mostly IT related.

766
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,160
Semiconductor.

767
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,680
Just a whole bunch of different stuff.

768
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,880
And then lastly, particularly

769
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,960
over the last number of years, governance,

770
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,160
corporate governance,

771
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,800
has really captured most of my interest

772
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,480
and most of my time, including the book.

773
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,720
So it would really be those three things

774
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,240
that would highlight my,

775
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,360
they would be three business words,

776
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,720
not necessarily personal words.

777
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,360
I love it.

778
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,000
Dennis, thank you very very much.

779
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,400
I really appreciate your time and effort.

780
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,200
I look forward to reading the book

781
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,240
as I gear up to start my own company

782
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,400
later on and form my own board members.

783
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,720
So also expect another email

784
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,400
to request some advice from you.

785
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,960
But thank you very very much.

786
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,120
Stay safe and stay healthy.

787
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,120
My pleasure, Michael.

788
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,320
It's the "Board of Directors

789
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,280
of a Private Enterprise"

790
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,680
and it's on Amazon and Barnes and Noble.

791
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,560
Wonderful.

792
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,440
Thank you very much.

793
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,520
Take care.

794
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:11,920
Thannk you. Take care.
