1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,479
I think no one more than me

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,399
wants to get back to in-person meetings,

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,239
because for me

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,639
this is a relationship business

5
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,199
and that's why I love what I do.

6
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,959
That's why I love

7
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,159
getting up every morning

8
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,199
and coming to work,

9
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,639
because I love having these

10
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,500
meaningful conversation.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,360
Jennifer Gross,

12
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:41,599
thank you so much for being on my show,

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,360
20 Minute Leaders.

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,760
How are you?

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,600
Wonderful, Michael.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,000
Thank you.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,720
I'm so happy to be here today.

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,960
I'm very excited to hear

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,120
about fundraising,

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,400
about American Friends

21
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,440
of Tel Aviv University,

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,920
the great work that you're doing there,

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,480
and really getting into the mindset

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,000
of what it means to be that helpful

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,600
for both a research institution.

26
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,800
But I believe it's Israel's largest

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,560
university by in terms of more than

28
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,560
30,000 students?

29
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,200
That's correct.

30
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,000
We are Israel's largest university

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,600
and covering basically

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,720
every discipline you can think of.

33
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,160
Okay. So, I'm excited to learn more about

34
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,400
Tel Aviv University in itself,

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,160
but I'd love to start out

36
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,520
with a little bit about you.

37
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,240
Coming all the way

38
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,200
from investment banking.

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,760
I understand

40
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:20,599
that you have quite a bit

41
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,040
of experience with fundraising

42
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,480
over the years.

43
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,080
So, obviously you're the perfect person

44
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,080
for this job.

45
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,400
Tell me a little bit about yourself

46
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,000
all the way from North-Eastern,

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,240
how do you make your way

48
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,720
towards the financial world

49
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,120
to get to be the CEO

50
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,280
of this great organization

51
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,080
and this non-profit?

52
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,040
So, you're right, I started

53
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,680
actually at Northwestern in Chicago.

54
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,320
I started there

55
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,960
and graduated,

56
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,840
went to work for Morgan Stanley

57
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,400
as an investment banking analyst

58
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,520
and did that program for two years.

59
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,800
Concluding that program,

60
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,560
I move to institutional

61
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,120
money management marketing,

62
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,960
the [--] product of a company

63
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,120
that was a wholly owned sub

64
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,520
of Credit Suisse.

65
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,680
And from there,

66
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,520
it was home with my two children,

67
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,960
now 23 and 25 year olds for 10 years.

68
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:09,959
During that time,

69
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,319
I got very involved in nonprofit,

70
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,080
and I guess, as a proxy

71
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,760
for working professionally

72
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,120
and needing to have my own time,

73
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,120
I got very involved volunteering.

74
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,360
So, I took on all kinds

75
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,760
of volunteer roles.

76
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,400
But the common theme

77
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,360
throughout those roles

78
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,440
was really it was about raising money.

79
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:29,599
And my feeling was kind of

80
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,280
where the rubber hits the road,

81
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,520
in order to help the people,

82
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,880
it's about the money.

83
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,840
So, I get sort of cut my teeth

84
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,080
in fundraising as a volunteer

85
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,680
from many different organizations

86
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,160
are synagogue,

87
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,680
my children's school,

88
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,880
some Israeli organizations federation

89
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,360
in New York City.

90
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
And spent about 10 years doing that.

91
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
And as my children get older,

92
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,600
they were in Jewish Day school,

93
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,880
so their day was pretty long.

94
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:56,959
And it became clear to me that

95
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,200
they didn't really need me at home

96
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,160
anymore.

97
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,840
And sort of at the end of my time

98
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,120
being home with them,

99
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,320
they between after school

100
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,040
activities and playdates with friends,

101
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,960
they were sort of busy

102
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,320
until 7:00 at night.

103
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,680
So, I saw that

104
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,800
this is really my opportunity

105
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,280
to be able to go back to work.

106
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,440
Before you continue,

107
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,520
I need to understand a little bit

108
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,200
about the context of fundraising.

109
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,120
What does it mean to raise funds?

110
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,760
Because I'm coming

111
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,760
from the startup world,

112
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,840
from the venture capital world, where

113
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,000
it's very obvious what fundraising is.

114
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,840
It's a more

115
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,640
of a transactional type of deal.

116
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,960
It's a partnership that we're

117
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,040
going to also expect a return.

118
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,240
But the type of fundraising

119
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,440
that you're dealing with

120
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,720
doesn't necessarily expect

121
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,440
a monetary return.

122
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,960
So, talk to me about the,

123
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,520
what is the process of raising funds

124
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,240
as a nonprofit?

125
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,520
So for me, fundraising is

126
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,040
is really a relationship building.

127
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,840
It's all about relationship building.

128
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,040
It's Michael, you're a philanthropist

129
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,560
and you're looking to achieve

130
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,720
certain goals philanthropically.

131
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,040
And how are we,

132
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,520
Tel Aviv University,

133
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,040
best in class partners for you

134
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,280
to achieve that.

135
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,440
Right.

136
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,440
So, it's really having a conversation

137
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,880
and getting to know the potential donor

138
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,920
and what moves him or her

139
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,320
and what they care about.

140
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,560
And again, how we can help them

141
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,680
realize or hopefully even exceed

142
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,640
what they're trying to do.

143
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,480
So the return,

144
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,800
well, you're right, it's not,

145
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,360
I sort of got my start in fundraising,

146
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,880
raising money for hedge funds

147
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,760
from institutions.

148
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,600
And you're absolutely right

149
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,680
with transactional.

150
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,880
And they were looking

151
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,200
to generate a certain return

152
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,560
to be able to meet their needs.

153
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,520
And this is very different.

154
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,800
This is really about speaking to people

155
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,520
who are philanthropically inclined

156
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,160
and who want to,

157
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,480
who have certain measures

158
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,240
that they want to achieve and really

159
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,320
either helping them zone in

160
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,320
on exactly what that is or how to do it.

161
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,480
Okay. So, it sounds to me that there are

162
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,640
a few different verticals here.

163
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,840
One of them is the people

164
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,720
that are already

165
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,440
considering themselves philanthropic.

166
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,760
They're known as philanthropists.

167
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,120
And then you're finding

168
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,200
some sort of alignment

169
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,120
between your mission,

170
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,760
their mission,

171
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,600
and then it's a win-win situation.

172
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,280
But I'm sure there are also people

173
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,400
that are not yet considered

174
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,960
philanthropists, but they may have

175
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,000
the means to contribute.

176
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,800
They may have missions that are aligned

177
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,320
and you're also tasked

178
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,120
with trying to find those people

179
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,880
and explain to them

180
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,240
what philanthropy could be.

181
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,440
Right?

182
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,080
You're absolutely right.

183
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,600
So, that oftentimes

184
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
is a longer lead time,

185
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,480
because that's not just talking to you,

186
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,080
someone who cares about certain

187
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,240
to achieve certain things

188
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,880
philanthropically,

189
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:27,039
but that's talking to you about really

190
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,119
sort of that's a much larger

191
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,000
conversation about values,

192
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,720
what you value,

193
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:32,559
what's important to you,

194
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,679
what sort of legacy

195
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,640
or what sort of impact

196
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,080
you're looking to have.

197
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,840
For people who aren't yet philanthropic,

198
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,800
but to your point,

199
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,760
have the ability to be philanthropic,

200
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,800
it's really a conversation of sort of

201
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,160
why is this the right thing to do,

202
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,800
why is this the appropriate thing for you

203
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,720
to do at this stage of your life,

204
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,480
why you why not somebody else.

205
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,520
And how can you feel so good about what

206
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,800
you're doing and what you're making

207
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,720
possible and the impact

208
00:05:58,721 --> 00:06:00,919
that you're having on others,

209
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,520
which can seem sort of counterintuitive

210
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,080
to iron the money.

211
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,400
It's my money.

212
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,560
So, sometimes there's a little bit

213
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,760
of a golf that you have to transcend

214
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,720
in terms of why being philanthropic

215
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,400
is appropriate

216
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,720
and not even just appropriate,

217
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,720
but is really extraordinarily uplifting.

218
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,920
So, why does a person

219
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,040
become philanthropic?

220
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,360
You're saying

221
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,320
it's extremely rewarding, uplifting,

222
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,600
but I don't think it's that obvious

223
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,640
to the average person.

224
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,920
Why spending money

225
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,880
or donating money is automatically,

226
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,360
you know, a rewarding,

227
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,120
enriching experience?

228
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,240
So, why does one become philanthropic?

229
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,040
And what does one gain out of it?

230
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,720
Because it is a two sided street.

231
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,200
One becomes philanthropic,

232
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:45,719
I guess, for one of two reasons.

233
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,960
One is, they really feel like

234
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,880
I've been given certain

235
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,440
assets and certain resources

236
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,240
and giving back is either something

237
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,840
that I want to do or I feel

238
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,440
is my responsibility to do,

239
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,680
or is the right thing to do.

240
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,520
So sort of internally motivated,

241
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,760
the external motivation

242
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,760
is sometimes about really introducing

243
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,400
this person or people to the needs

244
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:21,119
and to sort of the broader landscape

245
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,760
out there.

246
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,920
And I think pointing out the needs,

247
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,840
the opportunities and the impact

248
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,800
that that's possible.

249
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,600
Because in my experience,

250
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,480
I've seen that when you see, look,

251
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,280
private philanthropy is dwarfed

252
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,360
by governmental spending.

253
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,040
But governmental spending,

254
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,400
there are tremendous holes

255
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,960
and there are governments,

256
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,920
Institutions tend to like to fund

257
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,360
specific projects,

258
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,920
but without having the lights on

259
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,960
and the staff paid

260
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,120
and the copy machine serviced,

261
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,560
you cannot run those programs.

262
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,680
So, I think when people can see,

263
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,600
assuming someone either is

264
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,000
or is willing to become

265
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,080
philanthropically minded,

266
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,160
when people can see

267
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,520
what private philanthropy

268
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,920
can make possible,

269
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,600
it becomes sort of addicting.

270
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,320
And you realize the impact

271
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,960
when you really get to meet the grantees

272
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,080
or to see the programs

273
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,880
and to see what it is

274
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,520
that you can make possible,

275
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,200
everybody loves spending on themselves

276
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,000
and their families and trips and home

277
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:24,599
or whatever it is,

278
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,519
but this is totally different.

279
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,359
And for those who have, I think

280
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,559
there's a real argument to be made about,

281
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,160
or I should say,

282
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,560
the way that we've raised our children

283
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,360
is sort of the measure to which you have

284
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,320
is the measure to which

285
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,160
you have a responsibility to give back.

286
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,600
I love that.

287
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,280
I love that.

288
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,640
I have to say, growing up in both

289
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,320
in Palo Alto, Tel Aviv,

290
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,640
I'm right now a student at Stanford while

291
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,480
also a senior associate of J-Ventures,

292
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,840
and at the start of Hippo,

293
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,920
I'm surrounded by people

294
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,120
that are very, very motivated

295
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,960
and ambitious.

296
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,240
And a lot of these people are excited

297
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,120
to go into the startup scene,

298
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,520
potentially to be

299
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,320
going towards an exit strategy

300
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,760
or running a public company,

301
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,040
a very successful one,

302
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,320
or alternatively going into

303
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,480
investment banking

304
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,160
or other venture capital

305
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,480
types of funds,

306
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,080
all of which have high potential

307
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,320
for making a lot of money.

308
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,400
And when I asked them

309
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:14,519
what would the motivation

310
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,159
behind the money, very rarely do I hear,

311
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,400
I want to be a philanthropist

312
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,480
when I'm older, right?

313
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,280
I want to be a philanthropist.

314
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,040
Jen, I'm seeing the work

315
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,120
that a lot of the brilliant people,

316
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,920
like the top tech leaders,

317
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:29,519
that they're spending large,

318
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,840
sometimes large chunks of their money

319
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,480
on having a positive impact

320
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,200
on the world.

321
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,080
And I can't help but get excited about

322
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,440
potentially, if I do get a chance

323
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,480
to have means for myself

324
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,000
to be able to contribute as well,

325
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,240
it sounds like a fantastic impact.

326
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,880
But Jennifer, tell me a little bit about

327
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,600
Tel Aviv university,

328
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,640
what you're doing there

329
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,160
from the United States.

330
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,040
I believe you are one of the

331
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,800
biggest donors,

332
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,520
or the groups that are channeling funds

333
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,560
towards Tel Aviv University, right?

334
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,920
We are the largest donor

335
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
to the university.

336
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,640
Our support we raised

337
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,360
I would say around

338
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,280
$35,000,000 a year,

339
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,520
which we send to Israel, to university.

340
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,280
We're number one.

341
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,160
And I'm proud to say that

342
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,760
in addition to us being number one,

343
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,240
Israel is number two.

344
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,040
So, the Israeli philanthropic community,

345
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,840
while it's younger

346
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,400
and more, sort of in its infancy,

347
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,440
has really and you've started to see

348
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,600
Israelis with real means start to give.

349
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
So, we're proud that that we're first

350
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,720
and that Israel's second.

351
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,560
I think that's something

352
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,280
really significant.

353
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,600
Israelis are seeing the potential

354
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,440
and are investing in their university

355
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,360
in the same way that

356
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,480
Americans are investing

357
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
in their universities.

358
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,520
So, I think that's something

359
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,840
that's critical.

360
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,160
It's something that I haven't had

361
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,480
since I was at Northwestern.

362
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,480
And to get to the deans

363
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,440
and the professors and the researchers

364
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,560
and working in the labs

365
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,480
and doing the kind of cutting edge

366
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,160
work and innovation,

367
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,880
it's just so generative

368
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,440
and it's something that's so exciting.

369
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,080
And I think it empowers all of us

370
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,200
at the American Friends

371
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,560
to be able to tell the story

372
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,800
and to really try to convey

373
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,600
what's going on,

374
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,360
and the excitement

375
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,400
and the possibilities,

376
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,880
not just for changing

377
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,720
what's going on in Israel on the ground,

378
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,640
but really

379
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,080
the ripple effect of the technology

380
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,920
and the innovation and the discoveries

381
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,680
at the university

382
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,280
are really rippling out worldwide.

383
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,800
And that's something that's,

384
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,600
that's extraordinary.

385
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,960
And when you speak to somebody

386
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,840
about giving money

387
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,800
and about being philanthropic,

388
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,200
especially when you speak to someone

389
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,560
in any aspect

390
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,000
of the financial services industry,

391
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,720
whether that's hedge funds

392
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,200
or whether that's the startups or venture

393
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,440
or angel or private equity,

394
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,360
sort of anywhere in financial services,

395
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,920
I think everyone's looking for impact.

396
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,360
And what are the exciting things

397
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,280
about investing in Israel?

398
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
And not to say

399
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,680
this is at the expense of anyone

400
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,480
investing in their

401
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,600
universities in the US,

402
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
but that's sort of the purchasing power

403
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,040
of a dollar in Israel

404
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,200
versus in the US is just exponential.

405
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,320
So, we, Tel Aviv University was fortunate

406
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
that we're doing collaboration's

407
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,800
through the correct foundation

408
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,080
with Stanford.

409
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:12,759
And so, it's not one to one,

410
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,999
one researcher from Stanford,

411
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,199
one from Tel Aviv, it's one to six.

412
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,999
So, if you're philanthropic

413
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,439
and if you're thinking about the impact

414
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,640
and what your funds can do

415
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,720
and how they can go further,

416
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
that's definitely something that we see.

417
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:28,319
We have somebody who has been giving

418
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,720
multiple millions of dollars

419
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,080
for cancer research in the US.

420
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,720
And he just gave to Tel Aviv University

421
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,240
because the ability to have an impact

422
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,480
and for those research dollars

423
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
to go even further exists in Israel

424
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,840
in a way that it doesn't exist here.

425
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,160
I think, that's just remarkable.

426
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,760
But going to the beginning,

427
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,560
why does the university

428
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,960
need to raise funds?

429
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
Why does a university

430
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,160
need millions of dollars

431
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,320
in order to operate?

432
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,000
It's a great question

433
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,800
because you ask yourself,

434
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,600
you're the biggest university in Israel,

435
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,920
you're public university,

436
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,960
why isn't that the government's

437
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,760
responsibility?

438
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,200
It's a great question.

439
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,520
And I would tell you that it is

440
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,840
the government's responsibility.

441
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,600
And the amount of money

442
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,240
that the government gives the US,

443
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,440
the amount of money that the government

444
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,960
gives the university is it far exceeds

445
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,840
any other sources of funds.

446
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,440
And that those funds,

447
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:19,439
that funding level

448
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,839
gets universities to good.

449
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,639
Tel Aviv university

450
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,999
would be a good university.

451
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,359
You would have access to good researchers

452
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,199
and good equipment, but not great.

453
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,759
The difference from good to great,

454
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,479
the way that we're able to reverse

455
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,319
the brain drain

456
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,759
and to bring all the postdocs

457
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,559
who go out of Israel

458
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,519
because they have to do the postdoc work

459
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,479
that's going to be really respected

460
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,799
in academia to be able to bring them back

461
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,679
and to be able to give them

462
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,520
enough lab equipment

463
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,480
and access to postdocs,

464
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,840
all of that,

465
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,560
that's really private philanthropy.

466
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,720
That's where private philanthropy

467
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,240
comes in.

468
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,680
So, in order for the university

469
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,600
to do all it can do for Israel

470
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,160
and for the world,

471
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,080
it's dependent on

472
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,200
private philanthropy.

473
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,680
Wow.

474
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,280
So, it makes perfect sense.

475
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,520
The donations are

476
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,320
what bring good to great.

477
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,280
And obviously,

478
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,560
when I'm even trying to start comparing

479
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,520
the endowment or the funds that,

480
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,280
in places like Stanford or Harvard

481
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,240
or MIT have compared to the numbers

482
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,520
that you said before, you know,

483
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,920
it's literally adding zeros at the end.

484
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,760
Which is pretty remarkable

485
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,000
considering that Tel Aviv University

486
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,320
and other universities in Israel

487
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,920
do such cutting edge technology.

488
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
And we have some of the

489
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,400
brightest people in the world.

490
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,960
So, it's just phenomenal.

491
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,760
What is your day to day look like,

492
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,040
you and your team,

493
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,200
as you're working towards helping

494
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,040
Tel Aviv from the United States?

495
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,480
Are we talking about pre-pandemic

496
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,720
or post-pandemic?

497
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,680
Oh, last year or both.

498
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,400
So, pre-pandemic when I started,

499
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:50,919
I set a goal for myself,

500
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,519
which was in the first year to get out

501
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,599
and meet all the members of our board.

502
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,880
And the members,

503
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,600
the university has a board of governors,

504
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,640
to meet the members

505
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,880
the members of the Board of Governors

506
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,960
from the US,

507
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,200
and to meet our major donors.

508
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,840
So, I would say my day to day until March

509
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,720
was basically on a plane,

510
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,240
probably more often than not

511
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,280
getting to San Francisco, to LA,

512
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,880
to Chicago, to Miami, all over to Israel,

513
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,320
to really meet people

514
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,000
and really understand sort of their

515
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,560
relationship to the university

516
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,800
and opportunities

517
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,000
and just really fill them in also

518
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,200
with what we were doing.

519
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,520
And that was a real focus.

520
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,400
Well, then, sort of covid hit

521
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,040
and everything had to pivot.

522
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,640
And see that we took the opportunity,

523
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,960
when I joined in my role,

524
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,640
there had been sort of a gap.

525
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,520
For 10 months there was no CEO.

526
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,760
They have a CEO search on.

527
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,880
And so, when I started,

528
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,320
it became clear that

529
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,200
we really needed

530
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,840
some internal planning and structure

531
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,760
in order to be

532
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,160
as strong of an institution

533
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,880
as we could be.

534
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,160
So, when the pandemic hit,

535
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,160
we took advantage of the opportunity

536
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,200
or the lack of opportunity to travel

537
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,640
and to have face to face meetings

538
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,960
and really looked internally and started

539
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,360
a strategic planning process

540
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,720
where we came up with an overall

541
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,400
organizational strategic plan,

542
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,720
a fundraising plan,

543
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,440
a communications plan

544
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,920
where we really designed,

545
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,800
with regards to the fundraising team,

546
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,400
we designed what are their pipelines

547
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,160
going to look like

548
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,720
and how are we going to structure

549
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,480
their sort of workflow.

550
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,640
We really took on

551
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,280
looking at all of our communications

552
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,400
and all of our materials

553
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,920
and how do we want to change that.

554
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,720
So, we did this sort of

555
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,240
internal processes and planning

556
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,160
that have served us well.

557
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,120
And I think when things do open up,

558
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,240
we really will be able

559
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,720
to come out strong.

560
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,400
Wow, that's just amazing.

561
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,480
And so, what does the future hold

562
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:46,759
for American Friends

563
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,639
of Tel Aviv University or for fundraising

564
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,720
for universities in general?

565
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,560
Which is the future hold,

566
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:55,319
the future holds,

567
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,599
I think no one more than me

568
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,519
wants to get back to in-person meetings

569
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,359
because for me,

570
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,759
this is a relationship business.

571
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,319
And that's why I love what I do.

572
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,080
That's why I love

573
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,280
getting up every morning

574
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,040
and coming to work, because I love

575
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,920
having these meaningful conversations.

576
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,240
And I'm fortunate that sort of

577
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,000
where I am in my career,

578
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:13,199
the conversations are really

579
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,040
with people who are, for the most part,

580
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,280
philanthropically inclined

581
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,320
and certainly have the means.

582
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,040
So, it's an exciting,

583
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,880
it's an interesting,

584
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,000
it's always a meaningful conversation.

585
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,880
So, I'm hopeful we get back to that.

586
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,120
I think in terms of

587
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,960
the near term,

588
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,080
it looks a lot like trying

589
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,040
to simulate or give people

590
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,400
a similar feeling to being

591
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,440
in someone's living room

592
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
and hearing from

593
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,880
a cutting edge researcher

594
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
or someone who's doing

595
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,920
cutting edge innovation,

596
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,720
trying to use the technology

597
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,000
that we have to make it more interactive.

598
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,840
And after the pandemic hit

599
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,240
and we all went into lockdown,

600
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,120
we began doing weekly webinars,

601
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,920
which then in the last couple months

602
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,640
became every other week.

603
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,680
But I think people have gotten

604
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,960
Zoom fatigue,

605
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,720
and people want to connect.

606
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,600
And so, I think ways

607
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,880
that we can connect people

608
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,120
in smaller groups

609
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,960
or more around more specific interests,

610
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,640
I think that's exciting.

611
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,400
100%.

612
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,160
I think that it's very exciting

613
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,800
and I'm very hopeful

614
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,280
that it goes back to reality

615
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
as soon as possible.

616
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,840
Jennifer, thank you

617
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,680
for taking time to do this.

618
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,560
Before we finish,

619
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,480
I need three words

620
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,600
that you would use to describe yourself.

621
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,520
It's very tough to put oneself down

622
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,760
to three words.

623
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,640
Very difficult.

624
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,800
I would say my three words

625
00:18:36,801 --> 00:18:37,759
in alphabetical order

626
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,080
because I'm not sure

627
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,200
I would have to think longer

628
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,560
if I have to organize them otherwise

629
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,360
are caring, hard-working and positive.

630
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,800
It sounds like those are three things

631
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,560
that you definitely need as you're going

632
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,840
about the mission that you're doing.

633
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
And I think that it's inspiring

634
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,600
for me, looking at your background,

635
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,040
going all the way from investment banking

636
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,480
and those financial institutions

637
00:18:58,481 --> 00:19:00,039
and making your way towards philanthropy

638
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,239
and really making an impact.

639
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,399
And I haven't really

640
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,240
even thought of that,

641
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:05,199
about a dollar invested in

642
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,879
in a place like Tel Aviv University

643
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,279
versus a dollar spent

644
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,759
in many other places.

645
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,799
It's a different impact.

646
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,119
It's not to say

647
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,439
that it's better or worse,

648
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,199
but it's a different impact.

649
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,599
And it sounds very, very exciting

650
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,479
and that you are making

651
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,359
a very positive impact.

652
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,719
So, thank you very much.

653
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,879
And stay safe and stay healthy.

654
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,000
Thank you. You too.
