1
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,760
Linda Popky, thank you for joining me.

2
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,920
How are you?

3
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,920
I'm great. How are you, Michael?

4
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,200
Wonderful. You're in Redwood City.

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,800
The air is not the best right now

6
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,490
because there's fires happening today.

7
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,770
Right?

8
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,280
It's smoky out there,

9
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,160
but we're staying inside.

10
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,280
We're staying inside anyway

11
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,640
so it doesn't really matter,

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,920
but hopefully by the time this airs,

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,240
the fires will, of course, have gone out,

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,320
and hopefully covid will be

15
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,360
a little bit better as well.

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,280
I have to start with your fun fact

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,120
because you played the same piano

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,720
that Billy Joel played?

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,280
I actually played the concert grand piano

20
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,360
that Billy Joel bought.

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,480
And I'm a classical pianist.

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,280
I do that for fun

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,480
and to keep me sane.

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,120
And I was in New York

25
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,080
a number of years ago

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,000
and was at the Steinway store

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,680
in not far from Carnegie Hall.

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,360
And we were annoying one of the reps.

29
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,720
We were playing a number of the pianos.

30
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,280
And then she says,

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,560
"Try this one down here."

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,480
and it had a tag on it that said Joel.

33
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,760
"Who's Joel?"

34
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,440
She said, "Do you like that?"

35
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,360
I said, "Yeah, Joel's got a nice piano."

36
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,320
She said, "Do you know who that is?"

37
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,720
I said, "No."

38
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,080
She said, "That's Billy Joel."

39
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,440
So, he had tagged that piano.

40
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,520
He bought it, and we played it

41
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,560
before he even got it in his house.

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,760
Okay. So, I really hope

43
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,040
that you didn't wash your hands

44
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,200
since that moment

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,080
because I know that

46
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,080
I wouldn't for the rest of my life.

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,320
He's one of my favorite artists

48
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:09,720
of all time.

49
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,040
So when I saw that fun fact,

50
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,280
I was blown away.

51
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,480
But that's just, that's wonderful.

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,680
Linda, I want to transition

53
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,440
to marketing and consulting,

54
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,400
two really interesting things

55
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,800
that I know very, very little about.

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
So I'm especially curious

57
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,600
for this episode.

58
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,880
And I'd love to start

59
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,880
by talking a little bit about

60
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,680
the role of messaging and marketing

61
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,680
and your ability to help

62
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,800
other entrepreneurs, managers, executives,

63
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,680
convey their message in a way

64
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,560
that helps them at the end win.

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,000
And whether it's sales

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,960
or bringing the right people on board

67
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,600
or just getting

68
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,640
the right messaging across.

69
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,560
And then we'll transition

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,360
to the organization

71
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,440
that you're helping run

72
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,200
the SAC for consulting.

73
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,360
So, let's start off. Linda,

74
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,960
Talk to me a little bit

75
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,120
about yourself, your journey,

76
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,320
and why marketing?

77
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,400
What is it about marketing

78
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,480
that really makes you excited?

79
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,760
So it's funny because I guess

80
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,920
I don't think I ever consciously said

81
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,840
I want to be a marketer,

82
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,560
but I'm creative,

83
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,200
and I've always been a writer.

84
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,280
And it just seemed to be a great way

85
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,000
to get things across.

86
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,200
And I started out, I actually

87
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,280
wanted to be a journalist,

88
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,560
and I went to Boston University

89
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,280
to the School of Public Communications.

90
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,080
And they had us write things

91
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,160
like obituaries

92
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,000
and follow town council meetings

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,680
and all that stuff.

94
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:22,960
And I said,

95
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,080
"This is boring."

96
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,600
You know, this is not gonna be

97
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,080
the fun stuff you see on TV

98
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,120
and in the movies.

99
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,360
So I said what can I do

100
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,520
that would be a little more interesting?

101
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,280
And I sort of wound up in advertising,

102
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,560
in PR, and then from there

103
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,000
into really marketing.

104
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,600
And I think ... fun is

105
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,000
you have people like yourself,

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,640
you have people who are entrepreneurs.

107
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,000
They have a wonderful product.

108
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,960
They have a great idea.

109
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,280
They really are passionate about it.

110
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,040
But no matter how good that is,

111
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,440
if you can't translate that into something

112
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,040
that your audience cares about,

113
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,200
it doesn't matter.

114
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,760
So we sort of have this idea if

115
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,200
I've got this great product and

116
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,040
this great idea

117
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,960
we're gonna be successful.

118
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,080
That's not always true.

119
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,280
A lot of, too many, really good ideas

120
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,120
just fall by the wayside

121
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,640
because we haven't been able

122
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,520
to get the right message

123
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,640
to the right person.

124
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,120
And it's not just having,

125
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,040
say in general

126
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,680
what's good about you,

127
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,920
but why do I care.

128
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,240
If I'm your audience,

129
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,040
why is that important to me?

130
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,840
It's not important

131
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,760
because you're good or

132
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
because you're smart or

133
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,320
because you have the right credentials.

134
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,240
It's because you're gonna do

135
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,440
something for me.

136
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,760
And that's what as marketers

137
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,840
we have to do; we have to find the WIIFM,

138
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,760
what's in it for me,

139
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,600
for your prospects, and your audience.

140
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,200
What was that acronym?

141
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,840
WIIFM: what's in it for me.

142
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,040
W-I-I-F-M.

143
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,240
I love it. Okay.

144
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,120
I have to dig a little bit deeper

145
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,080
into this concept

146
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,080
because, at the end of the day,

147
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,520
you're right.

148
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,360
We're working, I could be working

149
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,640
16, 17 hours a day very diligently

150
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,560
on something that I think

151
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,680
is really special,

152
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,840
Bbt then in the one minute

153
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,080
that I have my audience's attention,

154
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,320
whether it's an investor,

155
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,640
a person that I'm selling to,

156
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,960
or another employee

157
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,950
that I want to on board to the company,

158
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,000
then it doesn't work.

159
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,600
So, what are some of the pitfalls

160
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,000
that you see people make

161
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,560
that I should be avoiding

162
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,360
on my entrepreneurial journey?

163
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,280
So, I think one of the things that happens

164
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,840
is people get so passionate about it

165
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,800
that they want,

166
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,880
because something makes sense to you,

167
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,760
it should make sense to me as well.

168
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,680
And so you have to be careful.

169
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,280
And also, most cases

170
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,680
we are not the target audience

171
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,240
for our product.

172
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,440
Sometimes we are,

173
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,680
but sometimes the lens

174
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,400
that we look through,

175
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,440
the way we look, is not the way

176
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,280
that other people are going to see us.

177
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,440
And sometimes you have something

178
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,120
you're convinced is gonna be used

179
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,240
one way and it gets out there

180
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,760
and people say,

181
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,520
"That's great. Let's use it differently."

182
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,880
So, you have to be in communication

183
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,680
with the people that you want to,

184
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,440
or you think, are really going to be

185
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,200
benefiting from what you're doing.

186
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
And you have to have it be

187
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,000
a two way conversation,

188
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,760
not a dialogue.

189
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,840
So it's not like "Here's this,

190
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,160
here's this, here's this.

191
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,360
What do you think?" It's gotta be,

192
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,280
"Tell me what you want" etc.

193
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,440
Now that being said,

194
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,480
people don't always know what they want.

195
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,760
No one said to Steve Jobs,

196
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
You need to do iTunes.

197
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,240
You need to do an iPhone and an iPad.

198
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,440
He said, "Wouldn't it be great if...?"

199
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,040
So no one said to the folks

200
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,560
from Uber or Airbnb,

201
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,240
"We should do this."

202
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,560
So, but what they did is

203
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,480
they looked at the marketplace and said,

204
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,520
"Gee, hotels are that's too expensive

205
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,120
and they're yucky.

206
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,920
What if we did this?"

207
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,840
"Nobody wants to drive in a taxi cab.

208
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
What if we do that?"

209
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,200
So, they looked at what was going on

210
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,720
and they said,

211
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,600
How do we make the situation better?

212
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,480
So it wasn't,

213
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,040
Gee, I have a great technology,

214
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,200
let me go out and get it out to the world,

215
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,240
but how do I change people's lives

216
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,920
in a way that

217
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,000
they're gonna really appreciate it.

218
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,240
So, then what is your relationship

219
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,080
with entrepreneurs and executives

220
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,920
as they're framing their messaging

221
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,880
and as they're thinking about the WIIFM?

222
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,960
So, what I do,

223
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,440
and I work with all kinds of companies.

224
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
I work with large

225
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,800
Silicon Valley, Fortune 500 companies.

226
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,480
I work with

227
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,000
professional services people

228
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,840
like real estate agents and lawyers.

229
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,880
But I love working with entrepreneurs

230
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,200
because they're always

231
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,120
so passionate, right?

232
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,440
I mean they love what they're doing

233
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,000
or you couldn't be an entrepreneur.

234
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,160
And what I do is try to help them

235
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,320
through that initial passion

236
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,840
where it's like,

237
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,320
gee, this is great to say,

238
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,680
How do we get that message

239
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,640
out to people?

240
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,000
What does that really mean?

241
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,080
And sometimes it can be

242
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,160
a little painful for them

243
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,400
because it's like your child, right?

244
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,440
So, telling your child is not dressed

245
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,280
the way they should be.

246
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,680
And you're saying,

247
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,120
"No, I dressed them, they're great"

248
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,440
So yeah, it's actually

249
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,520
a great baby that you have,

250
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,720
but we might have to put them

251
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,440
in a little bit different outfit

252
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,560
to have them be the rest of the world

253
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,040
see how cute your kid is.

254
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,240
So, it's that kind of a thing.

255
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,880
But it's great to be able

256
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,640
to work with them.

257
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,920
Sometimes what I do

258
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,760
is I work with technology companies

259
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,760
where they're very, very smart people

260
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,160
and they have the right idea,

261
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,440
they have the right the concept.

262
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,280
They know that they're gonna help

263
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,120
their customer,

264
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,320
but they're so focused

265
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,720
on the bells and whistles,

266
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,080
the speeds and feeds,

267
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,640
and we have to turn that into benefit.

268
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,200
So, I will take that language

269
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,400
and re-frame that in a way

270
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
that their audience says,

271
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,480
Oh, now I get it.

272
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,440
Now I understand what's in it for me

273
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,440
and why I should pay attention to you.

274
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,760
Because if you can't get my attention,

275
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,560
and you've only got

276
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,920
a very short period of time.

277
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,800
We have such short

278
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,360
attention spans right now.

279
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,120
Everybody, I mean you think about it.

280
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,280
Your average commercial

281
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,800
that you might see on TV

282
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,040
or on the Internet is 10, 15 seconds.

283
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,760
There was a time when it was

284
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,720
30, 60 seconds etc.

285
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,560
But if you can't capture my attention

286
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,320
in a few seconds, I'm gone.

287
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,480
And so, you've got to cut

288
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,040
to the chase very quickly.

289
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,320
And so how can we do that?

290
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,080
And so that's what I do is I help people

291
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,200
take their messaging and frame it

292
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,280
and mold it in a way

293
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,240
that people like you and others can say,

294
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,160
"Oh, tell me more."

295
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,080
And then once I've got

296
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,880
to tell me more,

297
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,920
now you can go out

298
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,320
as an entrepreneur and say,

299
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,360
"Hey, try this." or

300
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,320
"Here's what you need to know" etc.

301
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,720
But if you don't get my attention,

302
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,560
it doesn't matter

303
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,160
how good your product or service is,

304
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,920
because I'm just not there.

305
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,000
Is there a way to validate this properly

306
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,080
without going all out on marketing spends

307
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,840
and sending this to the public?

308
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,920
So, if I want to now go

309
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,360
and test this messaging,

310
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,440
and I sit down and I say,

311
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,360
"Okay, Michael. I have a 20 word limit

312
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,280
to send to Linda

313
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,240
so that she would be willing

314
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,560
to buy my product and be on my show

315
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,400
20 Minutes Leaders.

316
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,800
How do I get her attention?"

317
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,920
How do I go about that process?

318
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,960
So here's the thing.

319
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,160
There's a big difference between telling one person

320
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,440
and telling a million people.

321
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,400
So what you do is

322
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,640
you find a good target audience,

323
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,240
whether it's people you know

324
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,040
or people you are referred to etc,

325
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,480
and you say,

326
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,960
"Hey, I think you might be

327
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,400
the right people for this.

328
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,760
Let me run this by you."

329
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,040
What is it? Does it resonate?

330
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,000
Does it make sense?

331
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,240
And sometimes they'll say, "Yes"

332
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,480
and sometimes they'll say, "No"

333
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,280
and sometimes they'll say,

334
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,320
"Well, sort of,

335
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,840
but here's what it is

336
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,080
that I think makes sense."

337
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,800
And then the other thing,

338
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,040
before you even do that, ask them.

339
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,160
"Hey, I've got this idea.

340
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,000
What do you think?

341
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,360
Would that make sense to you?

342
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,280
Who would buy this?

343
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,760
Would you spend money on it?

344
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,160
Would that, would you pay?"

345
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,960
Well yeah,

346
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,320
or maybe you should talk

347
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,760
to so-and-so, or not,

348
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,520
you know, don't. Forget it.

349
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,520
I mean, one of the most important projects

350
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,680
I did a number of years ago,

351
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,320
because I also do market research,

352
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,880
was with an entrepreneur

353
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,960
who had a product

354
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,720
in the consumer electronics space.

355
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,920
And he was convinced

356
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,760
that this was gonna be

357
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,520
the next big thing, right?

358
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,520
And so he hired us to do some research.

359
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,120
And we went out

360
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,480
and conducted focus groups.

361
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,480
And we looked at this thing

362
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,520
inside, outside, backwards, forwards.

363
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,720
And people basically said,

364
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,600
I would never buy this thing. Why?

365
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,640
And so we had to sit him down and say,

366
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,280
"You know, there really is not a market

367
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,920
for your product."

368
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,040
And he was kind of unhappy

369
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,880
because we didn't just tell him

370
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
his baby was ugly,

371
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,600
we told him he shouldn't have

372
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,760
the baby at all, right?

373
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,720
So, he was sort of not real happy ...

374
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,480
but I felt that we had saved him

375
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,520
millions of dollars

376
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,480
'cause had he not done that,

377
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,200
he would've invested in this thing

378
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,720
and gone out and produced it.

379
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,320
He was gonna,

380
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,520
he had a factory in Asia

381
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,840
that was gonna make this stuff.

382
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,640
He would've wound up

383
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,840
with a warehouse full of these things

384
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,280
and been out a lot of money

385
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,640
and a lot of time and effort.

386
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,520
So sometimes, you learn things

387
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,800
you may not like,

388
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,640
but it's really helpful to know.

389
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,400
So, through the lenses of marketing

390
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,640
and through coming in

391
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,800
as a third party independent

392
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,400
and you're actually helping sometimes

393
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,160
uncover a lot of the really the dirt

394
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,240
of what's happening, right?

395
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,760
It's not just that maybe

396
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,240
the messaging is not right,

397
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,400
but maybe the product is not right.

398
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,480
Do you find that most people approach you

399
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,760
when they have a problem?

400
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,600
Or when they're, because it sounds to me

401
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,000
like you're the type of person

402
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,040
I would go to when I realize

403
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,600
that I'm not able to do this myself.

404
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,400
I'm trying and I'm not succeeding, right?

405
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,480
You know there's a couple things.

406
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,560
So sometimes people come in

407
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,000
'cause they say,

408
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,280
"Hey, we got to a certain point

409
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,160
and we're stuck."

410
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,000
And very often you get some people

411
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,760
that like what you have.

412
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,600
You get to here,

413
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,680
and you want to get to here,

414
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,120
and you need to figure out

415
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,960
how do you break through.

416
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,040
So that could be it.

417
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
But sometimes people come

418
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,480
because they say,

419
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,520
"We've got this great thing,

420
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,600
we've got this great product,

421
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,680
and I've got this idea.

422
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,000
And we need your help

423
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,880
to get it out there.

424
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,440
And how do we make this thing

425
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,680
be fantastic?

426
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,040
We haven't ...

427
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,560
We're just not sure how to get

428
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,440
from point A to point B"

429
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,880
And that's what I would say

430
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,520
is maturity in an entrepreneur,

431
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:01,880
because there are

432
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,240
some entrepreneurs that say,

433
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,440
"I know everything. This is great.

434
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,400
I'm convinced I have the backing.

435
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,840
I have this. I have that.

436
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,400
I know what the right message is."

437
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,840
And sometimes they're right.

438
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,560
And more often than not,

439
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,600
they kind of get a little bit push backed

440
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,960
because they think they know,

441
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,160
and they haven't asked.

442
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,520
It's all a one way street;

443
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,440
they haven't had that dialogue.

444
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,240
Right. Okay,

445
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,960
so talk to me a little bit

446
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,520
about consulting overall.

447
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,440
So before we dive into the organization

448
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,880
the you're helping run, the SAC,

449
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,960
I'd love to understand a little bit better

450
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,440
the role of a consultant

451
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,960
and why that is something

452
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,760
that is specifically interesting to you?

453
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,120
So, I spent a lot of time

454
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,160
in Silicon Valley.

455
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,400
I worked for Sun Microsystems

456
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,200
for a number of years.

457
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,440
And I left Sun in the early 2000s

458
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,320
and people would send me jobs, listings.

459
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,000
"Hey, you should do this.

460
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,560
You should do that."

461
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
And I'd look at it and say,

462
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,520
"I don't want to work for them.

463
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,600
I don't want to do that."

464
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,200
So, I sort of fell into consulting

465
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,080
because a friend of mine said,

466
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,840
"Well why don't you go

467
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,040
check this job out here?"

468
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,120
And I said,

469
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
"I don't think that's right for me."

470
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,040
But I did. And they said,

471
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,560
"Well, no, no, no.

472
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,200
We don't want to hire you,

473
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,280
but we'd love to bring you

474
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,520
in on a consulting project.

475
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,360
Would you be interested?"

476
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,160
And I said,

477
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
"Sure, why not"

478
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,840
And so what I found that's interesting

479
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,400
about consulting is,

480
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,040
one of the things I hate about

481
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,880
being in a company

482
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,120
is you sit in meetings

483
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,920
and you have to go through

484
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,320
all the corporate stuff

485
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,960
and the political things.

486
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,640
As a consultant, they say,

487
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,080
"We want you here to do something.

488
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,480
Can you help us with this?"

489
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,800
You come in. You do it.

490
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,520
You provide expertise.

491
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
And then you leave.

492
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,840
You're not there for all the other

493
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,920
ongoing things.

494
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,160
You're not trying to climb

495
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,320
the corporate ladder.

496
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,680
You're not trying to be

497
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,040
politically astute and all that.

498
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,160
And so, it's fun.

499
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,280
And then the other thing is

500
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,840
I get to work

501
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,400
with a lot of different people.

502
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,800
So, I get bored if I'm doing

503
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,240
the same thing all the time.

504
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,920
So I can be working with five, six,

505
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,120
seven, eight clients at the same time.

506
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,440
Not at the exact same moment,

507
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,280
but after I finish with you,

508
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,320
I'm gonna talk to this one

509
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,760
and then I'm gonna talk to that one.

510
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,160
And so it mixes things up

511
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,480
and it keeps you sharp.

512
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,360
But a consultant,

513
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,560
a good consultant, comes in

514
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,120
and brings their expertise

515
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,800
and helps you understand

516
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,240
how to get to the next level

517
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,640
without making you dependent on them

518
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,640
as if it's kind of like a crutch.

519
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,960
So, it's not that we're there to say,

520
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,240
"Hey, you need to keep hiring me

521
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,020
and hiring me." but,

522
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,360
"I'm here to help you solve a problem

523
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,000
or exploit an opportunity or whatever.

524
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,360
And once I get you set,

525
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,400
then you go on

526
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,720
and we go on to something else."

527
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,880
And so that's what I think,

528
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,720
and that's the difference

529
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,360
between a consultant and a contractor.

530
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,520
We have in Silicon Valley

531
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,720
we have a lot of contractors

532
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
which is great.

533
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,800
They come in, they get paid by the hour,

534
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,920
they do what needs to be done.

535
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,400
They might be there for years.

536
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,840
That's perfectly fine.

537
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,040
Consultants, we don't really charge

538
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,520
by the hour;

539
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,320
we charge by the value we provide

540
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,520
by the project.

541
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,200
And we come in,

542
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,960
we provide this level of expertise,

543
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,560
and then we leave.

544
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,200
And we go on and help someone-

545
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,240
As a consultant yourself, do you bring in

546
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,040
the expertise that you have

547
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,880
specifically in marketing and messaging

548
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,160
and through the book that you've written,

549
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,560
The Leverage2Market,

550
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,040
is that the main consulting that you do?

551
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,700
I do. So, a lot of what I do

552
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,800
is around marketing,

553
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,560
and everything from strategy

554
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,800
and branding and positioning.

555
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,680
I did a lot of work

556
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,040
with channels and partners

557
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,600
in my time on the corporate side.

558
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
So I work with people doing that.

559
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,040
Marketing intelligence,

560
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,440
which is like research.

561
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,920
But then I also work with entrepreneurs

562
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
and small business people to say,

563
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,600
"Let me coach you if you're having trouble

564
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,920
figuring out where you are

565
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,040
and what you need to do."

566
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,560
So, sometimes I work with people

567
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,560
just to help them

568
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,280
get their own ideas together

569
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,920
and help them move forward with that.

570
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,280
And then the other thing I do

571
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,360
is because I'm creating

572
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,280
a lot of content today is

573
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,480
not only do I create content for clients,

574
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,040
but I also edit other people's content.

575
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,200
So, whether that would be white papers

576
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,400
or promotional materials,

577
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,640
but I'm doing a lot of book,

578
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,120
either book proposals or book manuscripts.

579
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,880
And in the midst of this pandemic,

580
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,600
for whatever reason,

581
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,400
everybody's gotten around to writing

582
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,600
that project they had put off for years.

583
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,040
So, I'm getting lots and lots of projects

584
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,160
coming in about people saying,

585
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,280
"I finally finished the book.

586
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,360
I need someone to look at it."

587
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,080
And again, I can help translate

588
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,280
to the audience,

589
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,720
but I'm also good at saying, "That comma

590
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,960
didn't appear where it should be"

591
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,640
And "Yeah, you used ...

592
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,000
a dangling participle there.

593
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,760
So, let's fix the grammar"

594
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,240
So, all of those things.

595
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,160
So, I talk about marketing above the noise.

596
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
All those things that kind of are there

597
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,040
that aren't exactly right,

598
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,120
they're all noise.

599
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,280
And so, when you want to get out

600
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,080
and talk to someone,

601
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,520
you want to get rid of all the noise.

602
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,560
It's like static, right.
- I love it

603
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,000
Remember an old fashioned radio,

604
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,320
which may be before your time,

605
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,480
but there was static, right, and AM.

606
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,640
You want to get rid of all the static

607
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,680
so that I can hear you and

608
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,320
we can communicate directly.

609
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,440
And so that's what I do

610
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,240
is I help get rid of all that static

611
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,040
and all that noise

612
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,720
so you can reach your customers

613
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,840
more effectively.

614
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,320
Right. And I think it's very funny

615
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,280
that you mentioned that everybody

616
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,800
got around to writing books.

617
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,520
I'm actually publishing a book myself

618
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,280
next week that I got writing

619
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,360
throughout these covid times.

620
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,960
But I want to make sure

621
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,680
we also have enough time

622
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,960
to talk a little bit about this group SAC.

623
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,400
So Society ...

624
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,080
remind me again the exact name?

625
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,440
Society for the Advancement of Consulting.

626
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,480
So, Alan Weiss is kind of the guru

627
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,120
of independent consulting.

628
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,080
He's my mentor.

629
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,800
And he had created this association

630
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,840
17 years ago.

631
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,960
And he wanted to give

632
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,040
independent consultants

633
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,080
a way to get together

634
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,800
and work with each other.

635
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,880
And it went on and on and on,

636
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,680
but he didn't put a lot of time in it

637
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,320
'cause he had a lot

638
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,560
of other things going on.

639
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,440
So, two and a half years ago he came to me

640
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,120
and a woman who's become

641
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,960
my business partner

642
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,640
in Southern California, and he said,

643
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,160
"I don't really have the time

644
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,880
to put in this. Would you take it over?"

645
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,440
And we said,

646
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,480
"Okay. Why not?"

647
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,720
So, we took it over.

648
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,800
We blew away everything

649
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,200
that was old fashioned

650
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
and labor intensive

651
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,240
and took time on your part.

652
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,240
Made it all online, membership, etc.

653
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,800
Before there was a pandemic,

654
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,120
we were early Zoom users.

655
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,000
So, we knew

656
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,160
...

657
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,280
And we said, "We're gonna do webinars"

658
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,240
And what kind of value

659
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,600
could we add to our members.

660
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,320
So our motto is growth by association.

661
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,560
So, how do you grow by being associated

662
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,800
if you're an individual person.

663
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,160
How do you grow by having

664
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,480
the right people around you.

665
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,200
So, we do webinars.

666
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,440
We do online workshops.

667
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,560
We do all kinds of,

668
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,560
We have special interest groups

669
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,840
like around people who are interested

670
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,760
in supply chain and non-profits

671
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,000
and technology.

672
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,840
And we've grown the organization

673
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,640
so that we have,

674
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,400
now we have members in 14 countries.

675
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,560
So, it's been a lot of fun.

676
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,320
And people say to us,

677
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
"Wow. This has really been more

678
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,680
than we ever thought"

679
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,840
And they're across all kinds

680
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,200
of different consulting: OD and technology

681
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,720
and marketing and finance

682
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,160
and IT and you name it.

683
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,040
So, it's all kinds of interesting things.

684
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,560
And this year, actually this fall,

685
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,040
we normally have our annual meeting

686
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,960
every year in New York City.

687
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,560
And we had space on a hotel

688
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,800
in New York City

689
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,960
and we moved it out to 2021.

690
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,600
So, we're doing it virtually.

691
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,640
And here's the thing

692
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,040
that's really interesting is, you've got to

693
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,040
as an entrepreneur, you've got to say,

694
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,880
"Here's where we are

695
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,640
and here's how I'm gonna make

696
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,720
something happen."

697
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,040
We said,

698
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,960
"Okay, we can't be in New York.

699
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,040
We're sorry about that.

700
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,560
We're sad.

701
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,800
Okay, now we're done."

702
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,840
We have people in all over the world.

703
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,720
We're gonna have an expanded day

704
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,800
where we're gonna start

705
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,320
very early in the morning for us

706
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,160
here in California,

707
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,000
in New York, and we're gonna have sessions there.

708
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,040
Sessions in the middle of the day

709
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,000
for North America.

710
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,760
Later in the day for Pacific Rim.

711
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,120
So, no matter where you are,

712
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,160
there will be things happening

713
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,240
in your timezone.

714
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,600
We're gonna be able to get experts

715
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,720
that wouldn't come to New York.

716
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,640
And then we're gonna record everything

717
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,120
on Zoom and archive it

718
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,520
so you don't have to sit, Michael,

719
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,400
from 6:00 in the morning

720
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,440
till 10:00 at night.

721
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,560
You pick what you want

722
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,040
and you just watch it whenever.

723
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,640
So, this is happening in October.

724
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,480
We've already doubled the number of people

725
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,520
who would've come to New York

726
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,000
and we still have two months out.

727
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,800
So that's what I mean about you see,

728
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,040
okay, the whole thing about lemons

729
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,120
and making lemonade.

730
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,760
We can't be there in person.

731
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,080
How do we make this even better?

732
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,800
And I think that's what really makes

733
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,200
a successful entrepreneur,

734
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,040
is you say,

735
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,280
"Hey, this is not what I thought

736
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,160
I was getting into,

737
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,360
but given where I am, how do I take it

738
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,240
and do the best I can with it?"

739
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,040
Wow. I think that's just remarkable.

740
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,560
Linda, I want to take this time

741
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,600
to thank you for your generosity

742
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,840
and for all the insights for this.

743
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,560
But before we leave,

744
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,160
I have to ask you my favorite question,

745
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,680
which is three words that you would use

746
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,240
to describe yourself.

747
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,760
Three words.

748
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,360
I think number one is creative.

749
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,320
I'm a writer, I'm a musician, etc,

750
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,680
so I love creating things.

751
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,120
Number two is resourceful.

752
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,280
I take what's given to me

753
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,880
and we turn it around and do what we can.

754
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,360
And number three is determined.

755
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,320
You can't knock me down.

756
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,680
I'll get back up and then figure out

757
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,560
where we go from here.

758
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,480
So creative, resourceful, determined.

759
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,040
That's me.

760
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,280
I love it. I simply love it.

761
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,560
Thank you very, very much.

762
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,360
Oh thank you, Michael.

763
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,440
All right.

764
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,320
Take care.

765
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,200
Yeah
