1 I have a team here that came with one idea, and they already pivoted two or three times. We have a team that came in and people look at the idea and they were like, "What? How am I supposed to analyze this? I've never heard of something like this." And we said, "Okay, here's a 100k, let's work together." Tal Zackon, thank you for joining me on 20 minute leaders. How are you? Thank you for having me. It's great to be here. Calling straight from the F2 offices, right? Yes. Actually, as you said, the lighting was not good in my office, I'm in my partner's office. It's my aspiring position. I love that. I definitely love that. Tal, can we talk about pre-seed. F2 Capital, the junction that one of my best friends, Mickey, has also had the pleasure of being a part of, but also, about the interesting journey of both being one arm in startup scene and one arm in the investment scene, and you know, cross bordering the insights. But before we get there, tell me a little bit about your journey, and how do you find yourself in venture capital? Sure. Well, you know, I actually, I told this story a few times. So, do you want to start from South Africa where I was born or should I go straight forward to me joining the F2? If we had enough time, we would go back to when your parents were born. Bute we'll start when you were born. Okay, cool. So, I'm originally from Cape Town, South Africa. I moved to Israel when I was five, with my parents. I'm not going to go into that my whole childhood story but when I was 18, I joined the army, I joined the Special Forces Intelligence Unit. And then after the army after six years, serving as a combatant and a captain, went to study to IDC business. And for my studies, I did an exchange program at USC, University of Southern California. So, I was about 26 at the time, and then all the others around me were about, youngest were like 18, straight out of the high school into college. And some of the other exchange guys were like 21, 22. And in Israel it's not common to have internships. And all my friends, were like, yeah, I'm going back home, I'm going to be working for Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, McKinsey. And I was like, "Man, I have a semester that I have nothing to do. What should I be up to?" So, I decided to be proactive and reach out to bunch of VCs on LinkedIn. Until this day I say that any VC in Israel, if they go into their LinkedIn inbox, they'll find a message from me from like, 2017 saying, Hi, my name is Tal and I want to work for you. I think none of them responded seriously. One did, Johnny Saacks from a F2 VC. And before that of course, he was at Genesis. He said, "Let's meet for coffee." I came to meet him. I asked to join. He said, "No." I said, "Please." He said, "Okay." That's the short version. And two days after, I started at F2. And since then I've been at the fund for three years. Wow. Tell me a little bit about F2 about, about some of the insights that you've had at F2, but also about what F2 is all about as a venture capital fund. Sure. Sure. So, F2, we are seed stage specialized venture capital firm, investing in Israeli early stage companies. We believe that's all about the people, It's all about the founders. We put the founders in the center and we do everything we can to be an extension of their core founding team. We invest in deep technology, focusing on machine learning, AI, big data connectivity. So, it's pretty general, but there has to be some kind of aspect leveraging data or machine learning internally. Now, you know these are buzzwords, but we do have the capabilities in terms of network and in-house knowledge to really determine if this is real technology and leveraging state of the art machinery and data science. As part of F2, we also have the platform called the Junction, which is the pre-seed platform. And that's kind of our premise to the ecosystem. So, we go much earlier than anyone else. So, besides investing C stage, which is the core business, we also do pre-seed investments. And that's when we see a team that we feel the risk is too high for putting in a couple of million dollars, so, we will invite them to come sit at our office at the same time and also, give them all the variance, we give our preferred companies while also investing on a safe, a few hundred case and working with them towards the seed round. So, tell me a little bit about the pre-seed in general. It's very rare that a proper VC goes and writes pre-seed checks or present at the forefront. You're actually the general manager of the Junction. So, what is the junction? And what are some of the thought process behind pre-seed? I did meet a few very interesting people that are in Palo Alto that are working on the assumption that, you know, by reaching the founders early and going through the journey and actually when you reach the millions of dollars of checks, you actually have much more data to base your due diligence on. I know that 15, 18 fund, it's a relatively new fund. They write even thousand dollar checks to founders as a gift, no equity, just to get to know them and to go on their journey with them. But tell me a little bit about what the thesis behind the junction. I think that, as you described it very well, it's about building a relationship. So, all founders, especially first timers around, walking around the ecosystem trying to raise funds, and it's very important to understand that they aren't competing only against the companies that are doing what they are doing. They are competing against any other startup that has been established, all went to fundraising in the past two months. So, that's a very difficult competition. And the process of raising funds can take even six months if you are really having a hard time proving the value of what you are doing, and you also need a team to believe in you. What we offer at Junction is a very quick due diligence process that takes about a week. And we can offer at the end, 100, 200, $300,000 and offer them to come work with us and build a relationship with a venture capital firm. So, we also provide all this knowledge and this knowledge base of how venture capital firms work. And also from our experience working with startups, we can advise them on what's the best thing to do. So, we have teams here that came with these crazy ideas that all the VCs said like, no, and we were able to build a relationship, help them build the business and develop the idea and then go and launch a very successful seed round. In 2019, we had a few companies come through. And I think all of them, one maybe out of the 18 raise, but all of them raised seed rounds from really well-known Israeli seed funds. So, it's about building the relationship, understanding how the VC ecosystem works, bringing the value add and building the relationship, which is really, really important because they get to know us and they will understand if they want to even work with us in the future, and we get to know them. It's a six-month or four-month live due diligence. It's like the best thing, both sides. So, the pre-seed, you know, from my perspective, pre-seed stage really is a few people that have a passion, that found a cumulative passion together, they think they have the right expertise to go and tackle the problem. The not usually don't even have a product let alone product market fit, they go and they want to raise funds that they were able to come and bring some into fruition, possibly even get a few clients to raise a proper seed round. Is that too early to talk about VC? Because from one perspective, you can say that at the pre-seed stage, you really should be focusing on being with a team together working day and night and getting that technology there. But it sounds to me that from your perspective, it's not too early because getting those relationships can only be beneficial as you actually go in and want to raise a meaningful round later on. I think that these benchmarks of, if I have a presentation and then I have customers, can I raise? If I have $100,000 in MRR, can I raise? These are discussions that I think founders try and understand the formula of how VCs work. There's no formula. There are different risks that some VCs feel more comfortable with and some that others don't. And that's how it works. If I see a team with great potential, and I feel like I want to work with them and it's something that I can do with them and they are targeting an interesting problem or an interesting market, they still aren't quite sure, but if I feel that if I can work with them for the next few months they will be able to build something then I would like to work with them. And it's okay if they have a presentation and they haven't even written a line of code. I have a team here that came with one idea and they already pivoted two or three times. We have a team that came in and people look at the idea and they were like, "What? How am I supposed to analyze this? I've never heard of something like this." And we said, "Okay, here's a 100K, let's work together." Fast forward four months, one million dollars are raised. It's going to YC starting in two weeks. Things, you know, things develop. You just need to look at the team and see the potential and take a bet and what we do here is that because our core business is the seed investing, a pre-seed investment is kind of, I wouldn't say cheap but easy for us to deploy and take those kind of bets. Betting with the seed round is more difficult because at the end of the day, we only have 15 bullets that we can shoot during the active lifetime of the fund. 100% So, at the end, when it comes down to the seed round, how does the due diligence process look like for a company that you've been following along with the Junction through the pre-seed? Is it basically, you know, tell us when you're ready to raise and then we'll sort of know already if it is, or do you do the whole process as if it's a new company? How does that actually work tangibly? So, it's actually very different because we've been working with them and have these biweeklies and these ongoing discussions. We are super up to date with what's going on with the company. So, sometimes we will even be proactive and come to come and say, "Hey guys, this is time to scale. We're going to be leading a four million dollar round. Let's go for it." You can also bring the follow up like, we will do this for you. And sometimes they'll be like, "Okay, now we want the money." And we'll sit down and say, are we ready, are we not. Should we offer them another two months and then go for the raise. So, it's kind of this very friendly discussion in order to optimize for both sides. It sounds like a really, mainly, it takes away a lot of the stress of considering, okay how are we going to be able to fundraise and who do we fundraise from and how do we allocate now five months of our CEO's time to just go on this road show where you can have this invaluable partner that not only gives you that $300,000 in the beginning, but gets you to the place where you can be confident yourself about whether you're able to raise the proper seed round. And by that, obviously, we're not talking about the metrics that we're talking about, whether you're actually creating a viable business that could actually be impactful right? 100%. And one more thing, you have fun. I mean, it's fun. The vibe here is incredible. I have different startups coming for seed round discussions with different people from the ecosystem and you come into the office and this kind of this, this really cool buzz of like think about we have about at the moment, we have five startups sitting here, okay? One of the startups, as I said, grew to almost 12 people. They are in our office, [--] for them. I love them. They are catching all the meeting ups. Anyway, the buzz of something is always happening, all these meeting rooms are filled with people talking and drawing on the boards, and do this and do that. And this kind of a sense of community and we have happy hours. So, I'm fortunate because I get to work also at a VC fund, but also with five stops at the same time. So, you get of like really alternative kind of environment that you're not really used to when you enter a venture capital firms office. I love that. So, it's like additionally, and with a really great segue to working both with startups and in VC, you actually took a little trip down, startup plane now, a big trip as head of growth at Superwise.ai, while also spending time with F2. And going back to F2, you mentioned the [--]. But talk to me a little bit about this transition. Why you even do this and what have you learned along the way? Cool. This has been kind of this self reflection that I've been having for the past, couple of months. And I think I've discussed with many people in the ecosystem. As an investor, I've heard many times and I don't have startup experience, I didn't have until now, how can you evaluate a company without really knowing what a startup is about? Maybe you should get some operational experience. And I've been trying to convince myself and read studies that there's no correlation between people that were operators or investors that were previously operators and being a good investor. And I still think that it's true. But I feel that I need to gain some operational experience and feel what the founders feel. So, when I say to a founder, "You know, startups are crazy and it's really hard work." Now I can say, yes, I'm working at a startup and it sucks, super tough. And I've been learning so much from working with the Superwise team. The company raised $4.5 million in seed about a year ago. Hopefully, we'll be going for an A-round soon. The team is about 15 people, so, it's exactly the type of companies that I would like to work with because these are the companies we invest in. And of course, as a seed investor, usually when companies get to B, C, D rounds the seed investors kind of a part of the board, but the growth investors take lead on how to navigate the company. So, I think it's very important to, what's important for me at least to understand what this what the company looks like. So, it's like building the go to market strategy and talking to customers and doing these demos and follow ups. And suddenly, from being on the buying side, the companies come to me and say, "Hey, can you invest in my company?" Now, I need to reach out to data scientist and say, "Please, I want to show you a demo of this product. I think you'll really gain from using it." And they just don't answer. They just don't get back to me. Usually they do, just kidding. I'll tell you, about 20% of the times they do. So, that's a lot of fun. And, you know, closing a customer, paying customer, which is a lot for seed stage startup, it's like the thrill and the rush that you get from something like that is amazing. And I'm really enjoying myself. So, it's a great experience. And I can't even imagine. What are some of the most meaningful things that you're taking with you back to F2 from these few months at Superwise? Because you're mentioning that you went through the self reflective journey where you're thinking about what type of skills or what ever experience that you need in order to be successful investor in your mind. And it sounds to me like you've had a pretty impactful experience with Supewise. I'd love to hear some of those you know, insights that you've gained along the way. Sure. So, I think, the first thing is hustle. So, you sit on the board, I'm talking with your startup, and you're trying to understand what the processes and the sales machine, the KPIs. And sometimes as, if I look at myself as a future board member, I would understand that you have to hustle, okay? You need to do whatever it takes to get to the next milestone. You don't have to do things that are scalable, I'm not talking about product or technology, I'm talking more on sales and growth. Okay? And to use your connections and to reach out to people, you need to do whatever it takes to score these customers. And only after you experience onboarding a few customers, then you can really sit down and analyze what you did the right way, where you made mistakes, and then also kind of build the segmentation of the customers and how to approach each of them, and slowly but surely, then you start building that marketing sales machine. So, that's the one thing. The second thing is measure everything. Measure everything. Because there are so many insights inside those numbers that will really change your perspective on how to sell, who to sell to, A/B testing. I think sometimes you underestimate them. You say, "I don't have time for this." And it's a bit slow at the beginning. But I think that if you invest in the infrastructure of measuring things, that's a great investment for the long run and for the future and for scaling. So, those are my two main takeaways. And I will definitely recommend that to any of our companies going forward. I love that. Biggest tips for pre-seed companies, for example, that are coming to F2. Because you really get a chance to both seed companies, you know, in their early, early days and then in the early days of seed. Right? So, what are some tips more for the pre-seed? Because it's very great to be able to talk to somebody investing in pre-seed companies and seeing a lot of them and then seeing some of the journey that they go through. So, perhaps, what are some of the most meaningful things that a group of people can undergo between the pre-seed and seed that you have been experiencing now and you can sort of tell them in advance, by the way, watch out this this is going to be important? Sure. I think, being in love with your idea is a challenge that many companies have. And when you raise pre-seed, you need to understand that you have to be very flexible. And inputs from the market, and this friction with customers is super valuable and you have to take it into consideration. Because you might be directed in totally different direction. And I think investors, when you reach the seed round and you pitch them an idea, if you can say, I sold out with this idea and now I'm pitching this idea. And this is what I learned during the past three, four months. These are the insights I have on the market. And that's why I pivoted and I chose to go for this product and this solution. As an investor, I'll be like, "Wow, okay. He actually studied the market." Wasn't happy with his idea, which means he's coachable and flexible and he is able to kind of productize the feedback from the customers. For me, that's a very positive signal as an investor. It sounds amazing. Tal, I want to thank you for being so generous with your time. 20 minutes go by fast but I know that there is so much more that I wanted to talk about, whether it's the Junction, F2, where you're headed next. But it sounds like it's a phenomenal journey. And very similar to you, I think that I'm on a pretty similar path of trying to understand what does it take to make an impact, whether it's in investing, as a startup, as a learner, as anything. And it sounds like these different experiences are invaluable. And I'm definitely taking a lot from this conversation. So, thank you. But before we leave, I have to ask you for the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. Sure. So, I think the first word would be loyal. Something that I think one of the values that I grew up upon, being loyal to family and friends. And I know that people that I love, I'll do anything for them. And I think that also it reflects in how I work with the companies and how I work at F2. And in Hebrew, it says "takkana shema". So, I think that's part of really being loyal. The second word would be proactive. I think that you make your own luck and you have to be proactive and just be out there, expose yourself, be vulnerable. It's okay. I think you can only gain from doing that. And the third would be hustle. I hustled my way into F2. I hustle to source leads at F2. I hustle at Superwise to reach these head of data science and the machine learning. And it's all about the hustle. So, just do hard work and hustle and do whatever it takes. So, those are the three words on my mind. Tal, thank you very, very much. This is great. And stay safe and stay healthy. Cheers. Thanks for having me. Have a good one. Of course.
