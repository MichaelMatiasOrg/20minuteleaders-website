All right. Isaac, so good to have you in 20 Minute Leaders. Thank you so much for giving your precious precious time. It's a pleasure to be here. Wonderful. So, if I start going over all the things that you've done, I won't be able to let you speak for the 20 minutes. I'll just give a very brief overview and we'll fill in the rest of the details over the next 20 minutes. Founded a startup, sold it to Bank of America, Senior Vice President of Bank of America, and then went on to be director of various companies, moved on to venture capital, partner at Lightspeed Ventures, one of the most popular ventures here in the Bay Area, now founded MizMaa Ventures, investing in early stage startups in Israel and also the involvement with J-Ventures. And we've just mentioned the love for Oded and the capitalistic Kibbutz, and bringing together both Israelis and Jewish people from around the world into this mission. Did I get a good overview? I have nothing to add. It was great talking to you. Thank you for your time. I just saved you 14 minutes. But I did forget one thing that I promised we talk about, which is the fact that you're one of the largest Kosher wine collectors in the world. A real passion of mine, something that I've been doing for many many years. We did our first winery in 1989 when we were living in Sacramento. And maybe there were 10 Kosher wines you can choose from. And my partner at that time, Art Huntley, came up to saying, "Would you boil your orange juice?" So we went out to make really great wines and eventually sold to Israel the largest producer of kosher one in the world. And I've been doing wine projects both here and in Israel for the last 25 years, focused around drinking and drinking and focused around wine tastings and positions in the industry to be in a position way better than it was 10 or 15 years ago here. Isaac, you're one of the most world renowned entrepreneurs, investors and tech executives. What's the deal with wine? Why wine? You know, one of the things that really drives me is, And we can talk about this a little later is being a connector. How do you get people together? And I think that wine, because it holds the two components of being [--] It's both holy. So, the Friday night table, which is where every Friday night we have 20 people who show up at dinner. Young people, older people, yeshiva students, Stanford students. We have all the time. And wine is that connector. It's the middle man. And you can take a non Jewish, a president of Daimler to Israel and do a wine dinner in his honor, which we've done, of course. And he walks away saying Israel is great, but the wine in Israel is even greater. So, I find wine is really a common, for the most part, it's a real common bond between people of the whole world. Young, old, middle aged and globally. And so, I have a good palate. I mean, there aren't a lot of things I have good, but a good palate I have. And so, I started collecting and making and producing and drinking. And  it all fits together. Wow. Incredible. Incredible. So, how many bottles of wine would you say you've produced over the years? Well, the better question is how many do I have in my cellar? Because what I produced has gone. In my cellar here in Oakland, I have about three and a half thousand bottles. And then in Jerusalem, I have about a thousand or more and they're from every known place on the planet. And we have Spanish wines, Italian. All Kosher, Spanish, Italian. Obviously Israeli, California, French. So, it's quite, you've to come. It's quite diverse. I am immediately taking you up on this offer. And the minute I heard three and a half thousand bottles of wine in Oakland and a thousand back in Jerusalem. Yeah. Just unbelievable. How many of them are unique? How many of them are different? It's a really interesting question. We make one barrel of something called Harlan. Harlan is one hundred point Parker, it's the best non-Kosher wine. Pretty much in Napa. And I have a partner and I make a barrel every year. So, I get twelve and a half cases. So, from 2004 to now, that's definitely the most rare, but I have some very old wines. I have a beautiful cellar, so I have quite a few rare bottles because I have some of the great hard sodas from 1996 and '98, '99 that are still good. So, and I have the old Yarden's from 1984 and 2000. So, I've quite a few interesting bottles. Okay. I have a feeling I'm gonna enjoy quite a bit and coming for a Shabbat one night. Absolutely. Wonderful Isaac, talk to me a little bit about your role as SVP at Bank of America. One at one of the largest, largest organizations, very critical infrastructure. Very different from early stage startups, which you're involved with now. So, especially with a broad perspective that you can bring now, having invested in so many companies and seeing the whole world of tech from young to old. How do you see your role as SVP of Bank of America Now? So, that obviously I was an SVP at Bank of America a while ago, and I'd like to think that everything that has shaped my career, unlike your generation that gets to plan, almost everything that I've done has been accidental. And I say that because my dad was a rabbi. He was a rabbi in the same synagogue for 52 years. His father was a rabbi actually died in a synagogue and he was 65 years in the same shul. And I had no plan, to tell you the truth I meandered. I studied technology in the early days, but ended up co-founding the company that was pre-Internet, but still had a lot of the the components of Internet. And we did banking software application migration for banks. And Bank of America bought my company. So, they were my exits. And as part of that exit, it was very early in the Internet cycle and they hadn't been doing a lot in investing in or kind of partnering with Internet companies. So, I spent two plus years with them, simply helping them find early stage Internet companies both in the US and I convinced them to go to Israel. So, 1999, 2000, I started my monthly trip to Israel since then. Including during the intifada. And I learned a lot about what the corporations want and need from these early stage startups. And then when I got recruited to Lightspeed, it was kind of like I went to the dark side, which is where entrepreneurs go to retire. But it ends up you work six times harder than you ever work in your life. And I was able to apply my knowledge from what I learned at the bank into Lightspeed. And then again into the future investing I've been doing. So, having gone through so many investments and spent so many years and so many different venture capital firms. Do you have sort of an investor persona of how you approach this role then and the types of things that you'd like to see that you don't like to see? The answer is the most common answer you'll ever get. It's about the people. So, but I would say for me, first of all, because most of what I do is in Israel. It's about the nexus of California and Israel. Very very important at the businesses is that we look at now. That is all true up until MizMaa, which I started in 2016, because that's much more focused on the East. But up until then, the vast majority of my focus was really on building companies in California and Israel. So, great entrepreneurs, for me more than anything work ethic, it's gonna sound strange, but for me, work ethic is badly, as important as anything else. So, I look for how quickly do I get my emails return. How quickly are phone calls. If we talk about you'd like to meet someone in Company X and two weeks later you send me that information. I'm not interested in investing in you. So, that's one of my first tells or first signs is work ethic energy. I wanna focus on this because this is fascinating. And I don't get to talk about this often. Talk to me a little bit about this. The efficiency and responsiveness that you're looking for. Because this it also seems almost this is kind of a new age idea that we need to be very responsive. We need to be very communicative and all the time with our phone. So, talk to me about this approach of yours. So, even even back to the, I started in the '80s, remember? But even in the '80s and the '90s, if I got a phone call, I return that phone call. If I had a list of to dos to do for the day. I didn't go to bed until I finish that list of to dos. And so, for me, it's been my DNA from the beginning. But I think the problem with today is that there's always someone better than you. There's always someone working harder. There's always someone more engaged. And at the end of the day, the person is gonna win that race. Clearly, it's about intellect and working efficiently. Obviously, that's true. But there's so many people are so connected and so energetic that I think you have to be one step more in order to really beat the guy next to you. Because you only have to beat the person next to you. It's not about you know, there are five competitors. you want to be the one or the one of the two that wins. It's like the joke then that I think my father always told me that if you're in a forest and you're with your friend and a bear is chasing you, you don't have to outrun the bear. You have to outrun your friend. Yeah. And you know what? That's a great story. That's how I would say one of the key aspects of people when I look for people. That's what I'm looking for. Interesting. So, besides the responsiveness and the clarity, how they communicate, are there other aspects about their work ethic that you're able to judge along your due diligence process or simply the relationship that you're building with them? No, obviously I especially in Israel, because I've been there since 2000. I've been lying a very heavy network of people. Now, your generation is different than mine. So,  if I were to ask about what unit you were in and what you did there. You know, the truth is you can most probably trick me all day long. Because I'm just not, even on there every month. And so, at MizMaa, my new fund, which we've been doing for almost four years, we have an ex Air Force pilot, F-16 I-pilot named Yoav, who will look at you and in 30 seconds, no. Right. And then we have, my oldest son who did his degree at Princeton in cyber-security, And my middle scenario has pump in. He looked at a thousand companies last year. And then we have this guy, Rick Kaplan, who was the former CEO of IBM in Israel, etc. So, what I'm able to do is use there on the ground current knowledge. And then I could call Yoram Tietz the CEO of Ernst and Young. And he says, "Yes." Now let's talk. You can sit back and relax with the guys who smoke cigars and drink whiskey. So, it's kind of like a two phase approach. And they'll know everything there is to know about you. So, that's critical along with the work, energy and your creativity to really help. And, of course, what you're doing and who the competitors are. But that's traditional for everybody. I think it's incredible. So, today, even though all the information is out there and accessible and all our social media profiles. People in my generation just love to use them to not brag, but to showcase our professionalism. And that's where we wish the due diligence would take place. You're approaching this much more personal, relationship oriented place of we understand the cultures and we know the right people and we can actually get to the bottom of who you are. We don't have to rely on these more superficial titles that you might give yourself on LinkedIn or elsewhere. It's a great summation. I'll add only one thing to that. What I found throughout my career, but more now than ever by using some of the metrics and criteria that I have when the chips are down and the chips are going to be down. It's you I can depend on that are gonna go that extra mile, spend the extra day, be the extra honest versus some will say, I'm going to throw in the towel. So, that it all builds up and that's when the times are good that's pretty easy. When times are bad, I planned for it. Definitely. So, you've had the pleasure of seeing a few bad moments in our economy. And during your tenure as a venture capital partner, both  the 2008 crisis that I'm looking at, but also covid-19. Do you actually start seeing these aspects come out in the entrepreneurs that you've invested in and how they deal differently with these crisis, and whether their leadership emerges or sort of succumbs? Oh, it's like after the first hour meeting. Not when we start with them, but in these times the difference is across some of the CEOs, both in our portfolio. Plus, I've been investing for a long time, so I have other investments plus different businesses. It's stunning. The difference is the people that after our first meeting have already come up with solutions. We've created this concept. It's really a cool concept called a growth committee. Even though it may be a bit of a misnomer in which we take two of our partners and then another VC who's in our deal and the CEO. And we meet every week, every 10 days to talk about how can we help the company in this time. And some CEOs have changed their businesses, have changed in their direction, have leaned into it. And then they say, "Now help us." Some of them, and it's not just our companies, of course. Can you help us? What should we do? How can we do? When do we do it? OK, we're gonna course, gonna help up. But the difference in that conversation is huge. And so we're seeing a lot of difference both in the CEOs and how they react to this crisis. Incredible. Incredible. I'm gonna be a little bit selfish now. I'm gonna ask for some personal advice because it's pretty rare that I have the opportunity to chat for 20 minutes with somebody like you. So, I'm starting my journey like a lot of my friends, both in 8200 and at Stanford. We're starting our journeys. We're trying to become experts in these different fields, whether they're in cybersecurity or AI or diplomacy or whatever. And now we're gonna go out to the real world and we're gonna have to figure out ways to make a true impact. And my life goal, as I'm starting to narrow down, is to really move the needle to create stuff that has a positive social impact. Connect the Jewish world and Israelis properly. I know that's something that you're also very passionate about. And, you know, over your years of experiences and seeing thousands upon thousands of companies successes and failures. What are some pro tips that I can take with me more personally so that I can keep on this grit and resilience? Well, the first thing I do is I joined J-Angels. Because the very mission of what they're doing is in line with what you're saying. So, that'll be number one. Number two, this is tangential to what you ask, but it'll come back. And it's something that if I ever stop doing Zoom calls and e-mails, I'm going to do it. And I'm going to write a book on mentorship. To me, there is nothing more important than mentorship. You know, [--] [--] Get yourself a rabbi. It doesn't mean a rabbi. It really means get yourself a mentor and not one, but three if you can. And from the walks of life that you think you want to participate in. You can't just put up a dollar bill and get a mentor. It doesn't work that way, as you know. And read my book in 10 years now you'll get the hints. But it's a very very important component of what I would suggest to any person starting because you have a lot to learn yet. You know a lot. But you have a lot to learn. So, I'd say that's number one. And number two, define your goals. Not I'm gonna go into cyber, I'm gonna go into AI. That's good. But I would call define your goals. I'm going into technology, into deep technology. Okay. So, now I have a bucket and I know that I want it to be in Israel and And I would want to help humanity. OK, well, maybe it's something in the digital health space as an example, or there are so many great companies springing up. How do you solve the problem loneliness in the elderly? Define a problem that is fits the criteria or your criteria that fit the problem. And then who are the best people in that space? Who are the best companies? Who were the best mentors? Who are the best venture capitalists? And I met a guy who was a very very senior guy. Chairman and CEO of a huge company. And the year before, a public company, a top five, three. And the year before, 18 months before, he knew he was retiring. He spent that time figuring out what public boards he wanted to go on, but not which companies, which sectors. He figured that out. And then he said, what are the three best companies in each sector? So, we have 15 companies. And then he went out to figure out. When he left, he got the boards he wanted. So, that's a little bit later in your career. But be strategic about it without overthinking it. Because young people over think. Be strategic and then go after and you can do it. You have LinkedIn, you have J-Angels You have your 8200. When I graduated from college, my dad was a rabbi. Do you know how many connections I had? You're looking at it right here. I talked to my kids or to you. You have a hundred connections that I never could have dreamed of. How do they fit into your goals? It's incredible. Because so many people around my community, and I'm having these conversations now with former soldiers that I've commanded and with fellow friends at Stanford who are a little bit younger than me. And and they're looking for advice on where to go. And there's this constant conflict between this company that pays me maybe not a little bit more per month or the company that I'm truly excited about that is perhaps going to even teach me more. And it's almost seems like there's a growing social pressure to make the most amount of money and your Internship, or to be in the fund that has the biggest name or something. But you know, It varies. That makes me [--] Because, it's like a guy in my generation have 10 jobs. A guy in your generation, a guy or gal, will have 10 careers. Think about that. So, that's absurd. I mean, if you're poor and you need to put food on the table, makes a difference. Obviously, I'm not talking about that. But if it's 100 grand versus 80 or 70 or 60 and one you love. I wouldn't even have that conversation. Right. I mean, definitely. I think that one of the trends that I've been seeing talking to really incredible people through this show is that the really number one common ground that everybody has is the passion. And I'm talking to people who have a spark in their eyes. I'm seeing the spark in your eye the way that you're talking about the things that you do in life. And that's the solution for me to do things that I feel passionate about, that I have this intrinsic motivation and making sure, of course, that there's food on the table. But at the end both myself and a lot of my friends are lucky to have that. And we have the privilege of going and exploring the things that we're truly passionate about. Isaac, I wanna thank you so much for the time. I have one last question that I have to ask you. Three words that you would use to describe yourself or that your wife would use to describe you. No, the ones with my wife would not work. I don't do enough work around the house. So, let's not use that. I would say I'm a connector. I love the people. Part of anything that I do. Goal oriented is not fair, but I'm very focused. I get a choke in my head and I wanna go find a winery and make that a kosher run. I'm gonna do that. And I'll tell you, not the most important thing. But don't forget about it. Let's have some fun. You talk about people in your generation who maybe take a better job. I find people who just take themselves too seriously sometimes. It's important. Get a cigar box of cigars, get some whiskey, get some wine, get some friends and enjoy yourself while you're at the game. Because you're only here once. I love it. I think you're your lengthen picture with the cigar is one of my favorite pictures I've ever seen of anybody. So it's wonderful. I'm gonna take that advice to heart. Isaac, thank you so much for the inspiration, for the time. And I look forward to seeing you in one of the Shabbats. Sooner than you think. Wonderful. Take care. It would be a well and great interview. Thank you. Bye bye.
