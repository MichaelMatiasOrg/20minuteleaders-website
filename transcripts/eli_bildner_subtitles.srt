1
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:56,399
Eli Bildner, thank you so much for joining me

2
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,266
on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:58,599
It is such a pleasure to have you here.

4
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,199
It is a pleasure to be here.

5
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,032
Thanks so much for having me.

6
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:04,766
Where are you calling from?

7
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:06,666
Oakland California. Not too far.

8
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,499
Oakland California. Wonderful.

9
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,532
I'm in Southern California.

10
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:10,632
So definitely not too far.

11
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:12,532
But I'm originally in Maui

12
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:14,266
situated in Palo Alto.

13
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:16,599
So, Eli, 20 minutes is not gonna do nearly

14
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,066
enough justice for everything that

15
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:21,299
I wanna cover from Yale,

16
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,399
to Stanford MBA

17
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,832
to early employee at Coursera

18
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,099
Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,

19
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,066
and Bloomberg Philanthropies,

20
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:30,099
working on education and housing.

21
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,266
Oh my God. Where do we even start?

22
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:35,299
Eli, where do we start?

23
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,666
I don't know man. You tell me.

24
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:43,532
All right. Let's start from growth of a tech.

25
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:45,066
Move to philanthropy.

26
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:47,466
And then let's talk about this

27
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:50,266
non-linear nature of your career.

28
00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:51,732
Because just before we started this,

29
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:52,832
we started talking about this idea that

30
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,632
you know, today people don't have to choose

31
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:58,032
a linear path. So, you know.

32
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:00,232
Talk to me about being an early employee

33
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,332
at Coursera.

34
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,799
Andrew Ng is one of the role model of mine.

35
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,532
Talk to me a little bit about what you were

36
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:08,366
doing there and the grow that you help lead.

37
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:11,132
Yeah. Totally. Andrew is a great guy.

38
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:14,066
Everyone's got this sort of early

39
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,199
embarrassing early career memories.

40
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,066
I wasn’t so young when I was at Coursera.

41
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:20,832
I traveled with Andrew at China

42
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,932
a couple times as we were trying

43
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,666
to build a business there.

44
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:25,332
Oh yeah, Fulbright in China.

45
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,366
I forgot to mention that.

46
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:30,232
Yeah, this background in China, and yeah

47
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:30,966
I can tell you all about that in a second.

48
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:33,166
But I was having a little bit of a

49
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:34,699
tough time emotionally

50
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,966
Just not share about what I was doing

51
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,899
And I was having dinner with Andrew

52
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,232
and I just kinda like broke down and cry.

53
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:40,299
I was sitting there with Andrew

54
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,666
and I feel challenged in China

55
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,932
and he was comforting me and try to like,

56
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:47,266
He's a really caring and sweet guy.

57
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,832
And a great leader, and obviously

58
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,866
an incredible thinker.

59
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:54,466
But I had a very fond sort of personal

60
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:56,532
memory with him. I really respect him.

61
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:58,466
Well then, I would share

62
00:12:58,467 --> 00:12:59,432
that one of my life's goals

63
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:02,799
is to have a crying session with Andrew Ng.

64
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,499
Yeah, but it can happen.

65
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,632
There's hope for you yet.

66
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:08,699
Yeah. So, I mean maybe they connect

67
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,632
the career piece

68
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:11,466
that I've experienced at Coursera piece.

69
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:14,499
I ended up taking a job at Coursera

70
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,632
early on and really not without

71
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:18,999
much kind of strategy behind it.

72
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,932
I was really interested in

73
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,866
what would mean for the way

74
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:26,466
people access education to change.

75
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:28,132
I've been involve in starting

76
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:29,166
in a very early stages

77
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:32,499
in Online Coding Bootcamp and,

78
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,132
And one thing I didn’t appreciate

79
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:36,199
coming to Coursera is that,

80
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,766
at an early company where there is

81
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:40,532
so much growth, like really,

82
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:43,366
you end up dictating your role as much as

83
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:44,366
the company does.

84
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:45,699
And I came in with this experience

85
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,366
having worked in China.

86
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:51,432
Really, couple of months after I join,

87
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:52,499
Coursera is starting to think about

88
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,066
other opportunities for us in China.

89
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,032
And it turns out that I was really the only one

90
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:58,666
in the company who had business development

91
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:00,399
and partnership experience in China.

92
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,466
And so I was tap into this.

93
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:02,299
And you speak Mandarin.

94
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,732
I speak Mandarin maybe more

95
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:06,432
fluently at the time.

96
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:08,199
And I was tap to getting help

97
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,766
project managers effort and that

98
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,166
and became a big part of my role.

99
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:15,932
So, it definitely something I try to share

100
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:17,266
with people who are thinking about

101
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:18,032
kind of early stage career is that

102
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:20,132
whenever you come in to a role,

103
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:21,132
you have to think about

104
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:22,099
what is in your portfolio.

105
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,699
Even if it’s not something that was in the

106
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,399
job description you signed up for

107
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,366
when you're younger probably.

108
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,766
Particularly at that stage of a company.

109
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,399
There are a lot of opportunities to

110
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,866
to bring out that stuff to there.

111
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:34,166
So, I came to Coursera and then,

112
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:38,632
I was there from 2013 thru late 2015.

113
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:40,666
And then went to Stanford to do an MBA.

114
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:43,532
And saw Coursera grow from 40 people

115
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:46,366
34, 40 people to probably 200

116
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:50,099
And really interesting time in the company.

117
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,332
And in the world.

118
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,799
And then, after Coursera,

119
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,666
I've done some work in Philanthropy before.

120
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,932
But sort of have since I graduate

121
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:00,299
business school, I have work more

122
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,332
in a non-profit and philanthropy.

123
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,232
And I'm happy to talk about frozen times

124
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:06,466
of those two very different worlds.

125
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:09,432
But I've seen both sides of that.

126
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:13,332
How do you go from seeing

127
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,132
a great company growing so fast.

128
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:17,799
A lot of it under also your initiatives.

129
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,799
And then you're going to business school

130
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,732
which inherently business school, it's business

131
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:26,532
and a lot of the business school classes

132
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:29,899
I really hope one day I'll be able

133
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,732
to do that as well.

134
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:32,499
Yeah. I heard about the touchy-feely class

135
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,766
of the GSB.

136
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:38,232
And all of these different experiences.

137
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:39,799
It doesn’t seem like they are guiding

138
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,166
necessarily for philanthropy

139
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:41,999
and for non-profits.

140
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,732
Where did that even come from?

141
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,866
Yeah, I mean there are probably,

142
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:49,266
I don’t know, fewer than five people

143
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:53,366
in my class of 400 who went into non-profits.

144
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:56,099
or is operating non-profits.

145
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,932
So, not a huge focus.

146
00:15:57,933 --> 00:15:58,866
Although there's a lot at Stanford

147
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:00,466
around social innovation, and yeah

148
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:02,866
there's a lot of good exposure there.

149
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:04,999
But it's not part of the culture

150
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,032
and part of it either. But one thing that

151
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:09,699
I learn at Coursera that is stuck with me,

152
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,232
is that company loved to talk about

153
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:16,299
their social mission and their impact.

154
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,566
and are mission-driven company.

155
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:19,232
And like you know,

156
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:20,232
I think truth be told,

157
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:22,132
but a lot of the time that

158
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:22,966
Can I get to say this on the show?

159
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:25,299
[--], it's like more marketing

160
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,232
than anything.

161
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:28,899
Definitely.

162
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,532
Yeah, I worked at a community

163
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:32,799
non-profit now. But I also like,

164
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,899
I mean there's nothing wrong

165
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,466
with running a successful business.

166
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:36,399
And serving customers.

167
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,599
And serving employees well.

168
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,966
And how you run it really matters.

169
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:40,299
And you don’t need address that

170
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,866
I put this whole like you know

171
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,066
Or mission driven Fintech company

172
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:45,199
working on payment solutions.

173
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,632
Well yeah, I'm sure it's good for the world

174
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:48,832
Just own it like you're a great company.

175
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,699
You know, there's nothing wrong with that.

176
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,332
So, and yeah, what I came to believe

177
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,999
through my work at kind of mission-driven

178
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,666
community, I really respect Coursera,

179
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:58,499
is that, if you're a poor profit

180
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,866
and particularly venture back company

181
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:01,399
You know, you're always gonna be my

182
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,732
grading towards your highest growth and

183
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:04,832
highest margin of opportunities.

184
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,232
And at Coursera, that meant like

185
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:08,332
Coursera was never been,

186
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,799
it gonna be a company that was focused

187
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,632
on serving the most vulnerable

188
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:13,899
people in the world.

189
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,299
That just not what it was built to do.

190
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,166
It was built to scale really quickly.

191
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:20,166
Through venture capital.

192
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:23,399
And through technology.

193
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,399
And grow, and migrate towards

194
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,332
the best business opportunity to the company

195
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,766
which have turned out to be

196
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:31,766
in a corporate learning and development

197
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:35,332
and traditional degree programs.

198
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,432
I believe that's great.

199
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:39,499
I really believe in what Coursera is doing

200
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,632
in the world. I'm really proud of having

201
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:41,666
that I'm part of the company.

202
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:44,632
I love the people there but

203
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:48,166
It's not enough that, you know.

204
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,266
Our economy does not solve necessarily

205
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:53,399
for the problems of the

206
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,132
those traditionally underserved and

207
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:55,266
most vulnerable in the population

208
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:56,332
that's it with that.

209
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,266
So, I knew, coming out of my experience

210
00:17:58,267 --> 00:17:59,866
at Coursera, that I wanted to think more,

211
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:02,766
and work more on inker on a population

212
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:04,299
as oppose to inkering on a business model

213
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,966
and non-profits are really good at that.

214
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:08,799
I love it.

215
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,099
Yeah.

216
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,532
I think it's incredible.

217
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:15,032
And I think this take on impact,

218
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:16,666
and what really needs to be solved.

219
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,732
That’s really inspiring.

220
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:21,132
But then, you go. And you actually join

221
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,166
some of the most notable organization

222
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:26,932
in the world for this type of work.

223
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:27,866
You tell me a little bit about this

224
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:29,566
Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.

225
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,499
And what you would doing there?

226
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,532
And then the Bloomberg Philanthropy.

227
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:35,766
Yeah, I've always been a big fan of China.

228
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:38,432
You know, create your own career opportunities.

229
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:41,332
And so much just have to do with timing.

230
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,666
And during my MBA's summer,

231
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:45,532
I was just thinking about what to do.

232
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:48,399
I got connected from a friend and a mentor

233
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,432
to someone who is basically that kind of

234
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:53,799
chief of staff for intern idea of

235
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,399
Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan.

236
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,132
The Philanthropy which hadn't launch then.

237
00:18:58,133 --> 00:18:59,066
And she was helping them stand it up.

238
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:00,699
And so I became their first,

239
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,099
Oh, it was just starting back then.

240
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,032
It just starting. Yeah.

241
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:05,032
I became their first intern.

242
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:09,266
And I think I just always been drawn

243
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:12,432
to a kind of this early stage experiences

244
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:15,732
But I think philanthropy, you know,

245
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:18,466
each sector I've been involved in

246
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:19,899
whether it's businesses,

247
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,132
whether its philanthropy,

248
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:22,466
whether its operating non-profits,

249
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:23,532
they all have an important role.

250
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:26,032
And one thing that’s very powerful

251
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:27,132
about philanthropy is its

252
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,099
convening power. Its agenda setting power.

253
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,199
Sort of like the medium that way.

254
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,832
And that it's remarkable how little money

255
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,799
it takes to change a conversation.

256
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,399
Or to create a conversation.

257
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,132
And so, I'm really

258
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:42,132
What does that mean?

259
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:47,166
So, like as an example

260
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:48,466
particularly with public actors,

261
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:49,899
or state governments, local governments,

262
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,766
and even the federal government

263
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:54,399
there's so little, and even companies

264
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,432
You know, very very few companies

265
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:58,466
organizations, policy actors have

266
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:01,232
discretionary money just lying around.

267
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,432
And so, if you're one of these actors,

268
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:06,332
you wanna try something really new.

269
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,166
You really have very few places to turn

270
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,132
philanthropy is one of them.

271
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:12,699
And so, you know even if you're,

272
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,499
So just to give you an specific example.

273
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,299
I was working with Bloomberg Philanthropies,

274
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,766
evaluating a bunch of different programs

275
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:20,766
they might invest in. To spur investment in

276
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:22,399
career and technical education.

277
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,932
And so helping students enter

278
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,732
mostly non-degree pathways,

279
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:28,866
or help equip them the skills.

280
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:30,699
The State of Delaware was looking to do

281
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,232
something really different with how they

282
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:34,032
structured career and technical education.

283
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,566
And they were looking for funding to do it

284
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:37,932
And so I went down there to

285
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:41,566
understand what they were thinking.

286
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:43,766
They'd ask for a few million dollars.

287
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:44,966
Now, the state of Delaware,

288
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:47,699
their entire budget for K12

289
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,466
I don't if its off the top of my head,

290
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:54,866
but it's certainly hundreds and millions of dollars.

291
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:57,932
But for to grant the request of $3,000,000

292
00:20:57,933 --> 00:21:01,432
they brought out the governor, a senator

293
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:05,099
the CEO of a major company.

294
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,932
Like that is what the promise

295
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,066
the few million dollars

296
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,832
to discretionary capital could unlock.

297
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,366
And so, if you're a funder,

298
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:14,066
you have this unbelievable,

299
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:16,799
you know, everyone’s gonna answer your call.

300
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,332
And it's a tremendous power and privilege

301
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,166
that comes with a lot of responsibility.

302
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:22,299
In my mind.

303
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,032
But, for example like you don’t have

304
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,799
millions of dollars to give away

305
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,032
It makes working on the philanthropy

306
00:21:28,033 --> 00:21:31,032
interesting. 'Cause if you can help funders

307
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:34,532
channel their energy in productive ways

308
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:35,732
like you really do have a good shot of

309
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:38,966
changing conversations and

310
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:40,599
setting agendas.

311
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,166
Wow. You know that's insane.

312
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:46,532
So then you moved on to Bloomberg and

313
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:48,332
Do you do something similar over there

314
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,666
as what you did in Chan Zuckerberg Initiative?

315
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:53,499
Largely. With Chan Zuckerberg Initiative

316
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,299
I was focused on helping them think

317
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,032
about how they might improve

318
00:21:58,033 --> 00:21:59,932
housing affordability in California.

319
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:01,066
And particularly in the Bay Area.

320
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:02,999
And then at Bloomberg,

321
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,599
my work was more around

322
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,599
higher education and

323
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,666
career education pathways.

324
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:10,099
But similar kind of philanthropic advising.

325
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,699
Which is just, it's of these things

326
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,232
Yeah, were going back to the thread.

327
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:16,499
we started before the interview.

328
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,899
Around career, that you know

329
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,099
sometimes you just learn that you have

330
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,232
a skillset or that, you know,

331
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:23,532
you kind of end up in a network and

332
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:25,932
and then building a portfolio projects

333
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:27,299
around that can be really rewarding.

334
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,766
So for me, part of that,

335
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:30,332
is just been getting to dice

336
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,032
different philanthropies on how they

337
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:32,766
spend their money

338
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:35,799
and what priority projects they pursue.

339
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,399
So what is Concourse Education?

340
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,632
I believe you're wearing, I believe the

341
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:42,932
the logo is on your sweatshirt, right?

342
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:43,899
So Concourse is a non-profit

343
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,832
that I co-founded about three years ago.

344
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,732
That was my first take at starting

345
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:52,832
and operating non-profit college program

346
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,532
that helps particularly low-income

347
00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:56,599
working adults in California.

348
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,999
And accelerated low-cost

349
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,832
Bachelor’s Degree

350
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:03,799
Wow. So, you're helping them actually

351
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,466
achieve their dream.

352
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,999
And how do you actually go about doing that?

353
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,866
So, we have a,

354
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:11,532
Our headline goal is to dramatically

355
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:12,966
simplify the college experience

356
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:15,599
for working adults who are competing

357
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,766
for their attention with kids, with work

358
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:21,099
with all the complications of life.

359
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,332
And particularly for people who might be

360
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,732
working more than one job, or low-wage jobs.

361
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:26,666
And so, you know they don't have time

362
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:28,532
to be on the phone for two hours

363
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:29,799
with the financial aid officer

364
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,266
trying to figure out what forms to file.

365
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:33,366
Or you know, if they need academic help

366
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:34,999
to figure out the tiny different places

367
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,832
they might go to get it like college needs

368
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,132
that we designed for them

369
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:39,699
And so that's what we've done.

370
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,732
We basically redesign the

371
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:42,299
college experience to really serve

372
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,732
the student population and we have

373
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:49,132
done that by partnering with two

374
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:50,132
accredited universities.

375
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:52,566
So we're standing along 501(c)(3) non-profit.

376
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:53,932
We've kind of lately abolish partnership

377
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,666
with these universities where we

378
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,966
essentially ride of their accreditation

379
00:23:57,967 --> 00:23:59,199
and their access to financial aid.

380
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,632
to again create a better college experience

381
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:04,699
for working students.

382
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,032
Incredible.

383
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:09,132
So, Eli, over all these years working

384
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:10,099
with non-profits.

385
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,599
Trying to solve really meaningful issues.

386
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,366
I mean, these are not simple issues.

387
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:15,132
So, you know it's one thing to say

388
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:16,732
I hope I'm gonna do startup that

389
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:19,532
you know, makes you a better runner.

390
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:20,532
With a device or whatever.

391
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:21,366
It's another thing to say,

392
00:24:21,367 --> 00:24:23,866
"Okay, I'm gonna tackle this from of

393
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:25,299
low-income people trying to

394
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,566
attain a college education while

395
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,499
going through the different adversities

396
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,966
that life has to offer."

397
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:32,299
I'd love to sort of peek to your brain

398
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,632
over the last few minutes that we have.

399
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:35,799
What are some of your [--]

400
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,466
over this non-profit sector about

401
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:41,366
what does it take to go and really

402
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:44,066
challenge these big big problems?

403
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,932
Yeah. It's a great question.

404
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:49,732
I think one is the just right size expectations.

405
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:51,799
You know, non-profits, they're not

406
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,832
gonna change the world in two years.

407
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,732
They’re really slow build organizations.

408
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:57,832
And for couple reasons.

409
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,432
One is the problems, as you reference

410
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:00,399
they're really intractable.

411
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,199
These are hard problems to solve.

412
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,599
Two, you're almost definitionally

413
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,766
they sort of our non-market problems

414
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:10,132
and there's market failures so your kind of

415
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,399
your running against headwinds.

416
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,666
And then three, in terms of what is the

417
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:16,166
what is the lifeblood

418
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:17,366
that keeps non-profits going?

419
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:18,932
Obviously it's called Profit Capital.

420
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:21,899
Even for unearned revenue non-profit like that.

421
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,999
So, we actually earn money from our services.

422
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,999
We still need our profit capital to grow.

423
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,199
And philanthropies is so different from VC.

424
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,232
So, just to give you a sense

425
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:31,466
of what that looks like in practice.

426
00:25:31,467 --> 00:25:34,632
With VC, if you're a associate of VC

427
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,999
you're looking for deals where it's a 10x,

428
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,132
or 20x, or 100x.

429
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:41,866
That's gonna be a great portfolio of work.

430
00:25:41,867 --> 00:25:44,032
If you're asking money from a philanthropy,

431
00:25:44,033 --> 00:25:45,099
they were a very different orientation.

432
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,932
First of all, it's not so clear what 10x,

433
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:48,999
or a100x is.

434
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,166
Sure. But it's more in the impact for,

435
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:53,399
The whole conversation is centered more

436
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,399
around impact rather than return.

437
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,732
It's centered more on impact and more on

438
00:25:56,733 --> 00:25:58,199
than more on a return.

439
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,132
But a program officer is not necessarily

440
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:03,199
incentivized to go for the riskiest proposition.

441
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,899
Because even if it does pay off,

442
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,332
paying off could take place over

443
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:07,299
10 to 20 years.

444
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,166
And things that go really badly,

445
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,532
go really badly in six to 12 months.

446
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:14,532
So, just from a incentive perspective,

447
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:16,666
philanthropies not incentivized to

448
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:19,099
really do super risky things.

449
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,032
At the same time,

450
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:21,766
philanthropies are very reasonably.

451
00:26:21,767 --> 00:26:23,766
Because non-profits are not

452
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:25,199
you know, most non-profits are not

453
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,366
on a track to become self-sustaining

454
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:28,699
on revenue.

455
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,399
You know, if you're a philanthropy,

456
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,799
you don’t wanna set up a non-profit with a

457
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,932
$5 million annual budget in year one.

458
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:35,499
And in year two, they have that cliff.

459
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,032
Where it's like, if we don't raise $5 million,

460
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:38,799
we're dead.

461
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,732
So, non-profits, the way they work

462
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:41,832
is they're constantly,

463
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,432
we're constantly raising our next month

464
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:45,899
of runway all the time.

465
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,332
And what this means, my resourcing perspective

466
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:50,166
is it's really hard to inbox them

467
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,232
like a five or 10,

468
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:52,599
or even a two-year time pricing

469
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,899
like in a for profit company.

470
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,066
So, I think the headline in all this is that

471
00:26:58,067 --> 00:26:59,999
non-profit philanthropy field is really

472
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,166
valuable places to work.

473
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:02,199
They're trade-offs.

474
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,599
And one of the trade-offs is that

475
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,899
And if you're really sluggy

476
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,832
And its more of a slow burn

477
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:09,632
most the time and for profits.

478
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:11,466
So, do you see yourself,

479
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:13,866
We talked about this idea of non-linear

480
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:14,432
career pathways.

481
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:15,399
Do you see yourself going back

482
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,232
to the sort of a business sector

483
00:27:18,233 --> 00:27:19,066
and the for-profit sector?

484
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:20,199
Or is it something that you're really

485
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,732
passionate about that you see yourself

486
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:23,599
going forever?

487
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,699
Yeah. I'm not an ideal about any particular

488
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,666
organization of an entity like you know,

489
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,032
some companies are great,

490
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:35,466
that's for profits and non-profits,

491
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:36,799
that are great. I believe in

492
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,066
the importance on the rule of government.

493
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:39,866
And so, my hope maybe at the

494
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,799
end of the conversation where we started

495
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,932
I think, I learned about myself that

496
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:46,632
I love having a portfolio

497
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:47,166
of things I worked on.

498
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,632
And so, I would be surprised,

499
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:52,266
although not shocked if I,

500
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:55,599
if I never spend 10 or 15 or 20 years

501
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,532
on one thing in my career.

502
00:27:57,533 --> 00:27:59,332
It's just not exactly who I am.

503
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:00,199
Or not who I've been.

504
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,999
Although we all gonna change.

505
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,032
One thing I like to share with people

506
00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:04,199
who are thinking about their own careers

507
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,032
and create trajectories is that

508
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:06,666
that's okay. Like I think for me

509
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:09,032
I felt that was really not okay for awhile

510
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:11,066
And I was talking to a mentor of mine

511
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:12,232
And he basically asked,

512
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:13,899
"Have you ever considered that this is okay?

513
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,866
Like this is not a problem to solve?"

514
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:19,532
But maybe a [--]

515
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:20,732
Totally. Exactly. Well played.

516
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:23,566
So, then when I was listening to this

517
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:24,766
you singing about their own career,

518
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:26,866
in courier design like you know,

519
00:28:26,867 --> 00:28:28,632
maybe look at the patterns

520
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:30,599
that you've created in your early career

521
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,699
and think critically about

522
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,332
you de-problematize them.

523
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,399
Is this actually a problem?

524
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,699
And if it feels like a problem,

525
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,499
how might I make it not a problem?

526
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,399
And sometimes that can be

527
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,366
I think liberating.

528
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:42,532
Definitely. You know, I love it.

529
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:43,299
You know, we have just about

530
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,266
a minute and a half left.

531
00:28:44,267 --> 00:28:46,132
And I have so many more questions.

532
00:28:46,133 --> 00:28:47,832
But, I have the most important one.

533
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:49,099
And I'm gonna put you on the spot.

534
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,566
So, I apologize in advance.

535
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:53,099
I'd love for you to tell me three words

536
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,732
that would best describe yourself.

537
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:57,432
That you would best describe yourself?

538
00:28:57,433 --> 00:28:58,932
Or that one of your co-founders

539
00:28:58,933 --> 00:28:59,699
would describe you

540
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,499
or Andrew Ng would describe you as.

541
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,599
Oh man. Okay.

542
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,266
Probably, Curious.

543
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:13,466
Earnest. Very earnest.

544
00:29:13,467 --> 00:29:15,299
And Neurotic.

545
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,866
Like a good Jewish guy.

546
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:20,832
Very neurotic.

547
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,166
I love it. Does it help with business?

548
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:25,766
Sometimes, it creates a lot [--]

549
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:28,766
but sometimes helps I suppose. Yeah.

550
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,399
I love it. Eli, thank you so much for the time.

551
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,366
Thank you so much for the inspiration,

552
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:35,066
I mean, this slow non-linear path

553
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:36,466
that you're talking about.

554
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:37,599
I think it's something that's really,

555
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,432
it's really magnificent.

556
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:39,866
And we have this really interesting talk.

557
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:42,499
with Alyssa Rapp, who is a GSB Venture

558
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,632
and I talked with her awhile back

559
00:29:45,633 --> 00:29:47,499
and I believe we already

560
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,366
by the time this airs

561
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:51,066
her interview would be published.

562
00:29:51,067 --> 00:29:52,832
And one of the most interesting things

563
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,432
that she was talking about was her

564
00:29:54,433 --> 00:29:56,499
non-linear path that she got

565
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,966
that she helped her mother to go through

566
00:29:57,967 --> 00:30:01,999
And today, really we have this privilege.

567
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,932
And especially that we get to go to,

568
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:05,399
these really great institutions

569
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,432
and we get to harness all these different skillsets

570
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:11,599
It's almost a waste not to go and try to

571
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,032
put our feet it. To dive into different waters.

572
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:16,466
And to test different fields.

573
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:18,032
And see where we can make an impact.

574
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:21,032
On various sectors. Not just one.

575
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:23,166
Well put. Yeah. Toda raba. It's been a pleasure.

576
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:26,566
Thanks so much and great to be here.

577
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:28,566
Thank you and we'll need to catch up

578
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:30,432
over a beer when I'm back in Palo Alto

579
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:32,632
and this whole covid thing is over.

580
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:33,432
Beautiful word of spirit.

581
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:36,932
Cool. Take care. Bye bye Eli.

582
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:40,000
Thank you.
