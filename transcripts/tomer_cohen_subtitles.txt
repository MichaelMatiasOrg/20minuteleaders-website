Tomer Cohen, thank you for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? I'm great. How are you, Michael? Fantastic. So, you're calling me from Be'er Sheva next to Ben-Gurion University. And while you're finishing your undergraduate degree, it doesn't do justice that title to what you are actually been doing in Israel with Tech2Peace and dealing with one of the most extraordinary conflicts in history. Actually, a five thousand year conflict and making it very relevant to 2020, bringing technology and peace into the same equation. And I am very excited to spend the next 20 minutes or so talking to you about this conflict but specifically in the context of how can we leverage technology and commonalities and similarities to bridge some deeper rooted conflict. So, Tomer, take us away. Tell me a little bit about yourself and what is Tech2Peace? So basically, my name is Tomer Cohen. I'm originally from Jerusalem. So I'm 27 years old, actually about to finish my bachelor's degree in geography and political science. Nothing to do with technology so far, even though in the Army I served as a finder in a special unit. But actually the combines between I-Tech the technology and actually combat world. So it was very it was the first very strong moment of the I-tech in my life in general. In my first year in my bachelor's degree, I actually established with two other founders Tech2Peace. The Tech2Peace, what we basically do is to connect between young adults from Palestine and Israel between ages 20 to 26. But two things. The first thing basically is about learning technology. Like if it's programming or mobile AI development or AI for programmers and et cetera. Every participant for two week long seminar actually dedicated a lot of the time to study this subject and actually to build it's own or his own project. In addition to very intensive and very unique dialogue workshops. That actually my partner is Abeer which is from East Jerusalem and Uri from Haifa. We are actually doing it there. We speak about everything, about our personal experiences, about the history like Nakba and the Yom Ha'atzmaut Independence Day and all those issues in two week long seminar. And actually, because what we're trying to do is to build new partnerships, new friendships and partnerships that can go for the long term. Amazing. So just a little bit of context, because a lot of the viewers are from, you know, from California, not everybody is aware of of the of the deepness and the complexity of this conflict. And I won't be able to do justice in the 10 second brief. But it essentially talks about the Middle East conflict, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It's much more than just territory. It's more than just culture. It's about history. It's about deep-rooted beliefs. It's about generations of hatred that have that have erupted to where we are today and then unresolved conflicts that basically the whole world is trying to help out or not help in one way or another. And so, give me a little bit of what is this problem? So it's two weeks where they would come together. What have you noticed? And actually, I want to go back to how it started, because that's a fascinating story that you started telling me before. So basically about how it started and what we basically actually do every day at Tech2Peace. So basically two years ago I met the two other co-founders Abeer, as I said, which is from East Jerusalem and Uri, he's from Haifa originally. And they actually told me about the work we actually was running an organization we called the [--] Some Israelis maybe know this organization, but this is another informal organization which actually combine between Palestinian like we connect the Palestinians and Israelis. A full dialogue. Just to meet, being friends and actually make, you know, the most significant connections. And they did it for almost 10 years. And like more than 450% in Israel is actually meant for this program. [--] And once I from a moment two years ago, I was asking them, "Abeer, Uri, what do you think? How can we actually create bigger impact? How can we actually do something? Yeah, exactly. How can we actually, Because it's amazing. Palestinians and Israelis meet. But in order to actually try and do something very significant with the future of this region, maybe let's try other methods And Uri told me that he  worked for many years. He's a project manager in the I-tech industry in Israel. And I was about just finished my role in one of the like I think two Asian companies. The Israelis actually likes doing summer camps, like I-tech in Israel. And we thought, Okay, let's maybe try and do something else. Let's maybe try to do dialogue seminars like dialogue camps let's say. We've I-tech in the same time That actually the participants will get that vantage to get better future and some practical over life, basically. And the reason that we started with this model, basically, it's because of two main challenges. You basically you and the audience should know about. First of all, as you can guess, many of the people who already go to dialogue, a camp style of seminars between Palestinian and Israelis, those are the same convince people. Yeah. Yeah. Like Israelis home mainly from Tel Aviv and the Palestinians mainly from Ramallah on the west part of Ramallah. And some other very specific places. But most of the people that actually go and meet, it's the Palestines And so we thought, How can we bring new people, new people from the periphery of Israel, from the periphery of Palestine, from refugee camps, from like Bedouins, from the [--] How can we bring someone from Ashdod, from Middle East and Europe and places that are a bit far from Tel Aviv from the center. And then we thought about, let's try and bring them something, but actually we can use something, that all the participants we get out of the benefit of the doubt. All right. Basically. And the second reason that we established Tech2Peace. The second challenge which you wanted to tackle, basically it was that in many peace camps and in many other seminars we basically many times, not always, but many times there's no continuity. Right. And if the Palestinians and the Israelis basically act like it's very significant moments and we became really good friends. Probably once the seminar is over or the camp is over, the Palestinians go to their home. The Israelis go to their homes and there is no continuity. There's no threat. Is it possible to to create continuity in a matter of a two week program? Basically, yes, because we sleep together, we eat together at night. We actually shared the most intimate and the most the personal stories with one another. We're having fun with one another. And in those moments of after we finish the program around nine or 10PM those are the moments where the friendship actually created. And this is actually what we're trying to achieve besides all the very intense survey reasons. And this is what we do in the seminars. But other things that you and the audience actually should know about Tech2Peace. That once the seminar is over. All the participants become automatically alumni of Tech2Peace. And they start the alumni program, which means before the coronaviruses, they give you like every one or two months actually meeting with experts, if it's from Google, fron Microsoft, sometimes from MIT, from other places. In order to give them the additional value of after the seminar. Yeah. And sometimes also, of course, also dialogue to  get in-depth into the issues that actually talked during the seminar. And also between the 90 alumni of Tech2Peace that we have so far, 17 of them actually work on cross-border startups together. This just started in a couple of months ago to work on cross-border startups with our amazing partners from Boston. It's got a 50-50 startups. It's a new startup incubator. So it's very exciting. Wow. So at the end then, how many people went through this? How many of these two week programs have you done so far? Since the inception of this. So the first seminar took place in 2018. In Yeruham, down south in very isolated small town. With actually Michael Biton who is now in the government [--] he actually was the mayor of the city, in a small town, and he was very  advocated in order to let us do the seminars in his town. And after the pilot seminar we were surprised because no one think with actually what is the connection Between I-tech and dialogue? But afterwards,  it actually it works. We did other two seminars in the summer of 2019. And in this upcoming summit, we've actually gonna do two or even three seminars. And that that's gonna be online I guess. Right? Basically no. It's exactly. As far  as the situation now, there is a very good chance that it would work out. But of course, no promises. It depends. Actually, I keep forgetting that I'm here. I'm here in California and the situation here is much different than it is back in the Middle East. So I'm very happy to hear that. So tell me a little bit about you. So you've had, I guess, And it's about fifteen people each for each two week program? Fairly, 50 Palestinians, 50 Israelis So you've had about 90 people go through this thing so far. Tell me a little bit about what you've noticed about the the openness that you're contributing or so, you know, and I'm especially interested about the continuation of what do you see happening after the program with these participants? So basically, we try to  find in terms of applicants before the seminars, before we accept the participants, we try and find people. Well, actually, like kind of sense of, We could be entrepreneurs. It doesn't have to be about I-tech. It would be also about social impact stuff. Of course, it could be also about the other in the private sector and also the public. And also to work in the government one day. If it's about the past 40 or in Israel, we look to find the people who actually want to be leaders one day. And enough open minded to listen to ideas and concepts that are really not used to hear. Right. If it's in the West Bank or Israel. So this is what we tried to find before the seminars and after the seminar. So it really depends. Those are you know, they're like alumni. I really want to open start up. So we actually help them to get inside on top that. The partnership with the accelerator, which we have in [--] and those were most, you know, more thinking about getting into the I-tech. We also nowadays try to find more solutions, for also for them. With Microsoft and Cisco and other companies. So it really depends about the situation. Sure. And now let's go a little bit higher and broader. So this is now impacting, you know, a few dozen of people in dozens of people per summer. How do you get this to scale? So then how do you get the two populations to have meaningful dialogue and not just in small groups? So the best and the easy thing for us is basically to do, to create more and more seminars. Like now we do two seminars here. Hopefully because the demand can be easier. We so far, the application is still open. We got more than 400 applicants for it and allowing for only 60 spots, spots for the summer, 90, if we will actually be able to do in the end free seminars instead of only two. And the demand is this. So we definitely look to do more seminars a year and in more concepts, for example, each one of our partners, MIT So now we're talking about actually creating short a one week long seminar, which will focus only about the mobile app development and dialogue. And also we talk about like doing another concept, the four week long seminar with Google, Google for startups, with the office in Tel Aviv of one week long seminar, which actually focus about dialogue and about entrepreneurship to build up actually out to build startups for those who are actually interested. And then we can also find other thousands, I guess, of applicants, new applicants for the notes. Now, we try to be candidates Tech2Peace because, you know, to take a vacation, a two-week long vacation, It's for many people to be tired mainly for people who must work all the year or in the summer vacation. So. That was my next question then. These are everybody. Everybody is busy and taking out two weeks to form this dialogue and to be open and to learn, even to learn new things, even if it's disconnected from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, is very demanding. So how do you actually find this this balance in this Win-Win situation where people can balance it with their jobs? Do you think there's room to do things like this outside of a context of just two week seminar, but throughout the year and throughout the life? So basically, basically if I got your question right, So definitely we can scale it much more. We can do much more seminars. We can create new concepts with similar to our concept, basically, for example. Now we collaborate with M.I.T. about a We're hoping a MISTI It's the internationally Department of M.I.T. to basically help them to a implement take the best model in our place. And the best location hopefully going to be South Africa. It gets dark in Judaism and local youth. Yeah. So, you know, for me, as the Jewish guy for me, I just know it once. It will also spread a lot of places around the world. For me, it's amazing example of decoding, [--] Yeah. Even besides our region, which we hopefully know in few years, we're going to have Anglet and then after that, a thousands of alumni, that will to the government. So you're you're definitely seeing this grow and grow at scale. And what do you see yourself continuing to be a part of this full time over the years or or these years of slowly transitioning out and thinking about other ventures that you want to do? So it really depends. Because throughout the year, there are really really really tough moments you know. Three days before a seminar. When we also do not get sometimes the permits for the Palestinians to enter Israel. Wow. And we don't know if the seminar actually will take place as planned with the same participants or if it's it's about. Also now with the Corona virus. Of course, there's other NGO's the budget today is really suffering out of it. So there are very, very intensive and hard moments throughout the year. But, you know, for me as a co-founder, like, it's pretty hard to fall asleep at night. But on the other end. When someone Palestinian or Israeli in the last day of the seminar come to me, you know, with the tear under the eye and actually say to me, you know, this experience actually changed my life. This experience was so significant for me. So it's so amazing. I never thought that they're going to have a Palestinian friend and or Palestinian. I never thought that I gonna have an Israeli friend. Totally. So those moments of people and it's out of the topic but it's a lot for Tech2Peace because it's very emotional and very connecting. I think to myself, I do not wanna be out of it Never. But in the very hardly night. That I cannot fall asleep. Of course, I was thinking about. Maybe it's too tough to do something so, so crazy. Because in this reality, it's not something usual to actually connect between Palestinian and Israelis. In our region of course, it's something, you know, in the United States. So sometimes not nowadays, of course, but in other times it's easier to bring people from different backgrounds in the Middle East with all the suffer, with both sides, with many. There are so many victims of both sides. There's so many suffering, so much [--] so just bringing new people to be friends with people that been never thought they gonna be friends with and not for only two week long seminars You know, it's four months and hopefully years after. So those moments are the most significant. This is why I hope to continue doing this. Yeah. I think that it's it's amazing because I think it's very easy from far away to take for granted this idea of bringing together people for dialogue. And, you know, it's just peaceful dialogue. On friends without the differences. And I think that it's it's just hard to grasp this idea that in the region that where we're at in Israel and the Middle East in general, it's not that simple to get a Palestinian and Israeli in the same room. It's that simple, even logistically just passing the borders, putting aside all the personal differences and then and the fact that  your friends are gonna think you're crazy. Your family's gonna disown you potentiall. It's a problem. And I think that being this catalyst and fostering this annoying happenings is something that's really remarkable. And I I've always said it to my family and friends that I, unfortunately have started losing faith. And in the current system of how we're trying to solve this. And my personal belief is that the only way this will be solved is if my generation if our generation can grow up more open minded, Visit the world to talk to each other in a friendly way. Start putting aside 5000 years of differences, but focusing on the next five thousand years and potentially using technology to help bridge that gap and the similarities. I think that would be wonderful. And first, I can't leave. 20 minutes are almost up But Tomer, I have know three words that best describe you. Well, it's a challenging to choose It came by quickly. Yes. I would try. Determined. sometimes too much determined. Honest I try to be honest to people as much as possible. It's also very Israeli feel to to be in that way. Yeah. I have other words, Multi disciplinary. Maybe a bit impulsive. Maybe I love it. So I brought four different words. I hope you were. Very, very Israeli. I  asked for three. You give me four. That's a plus. Wonderful. Tomer, toda raba. Thank you for the inspiration. And best of luck with Tech2Peace. It sounds amazing. Thank you so much, Michael. Great. Bye.
