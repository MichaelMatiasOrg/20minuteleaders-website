1 Cecile Blilious, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? I'm great. Thank you for having me. It's such a pleasure. Of course. I've been waiting for so long for us to do this discussion because you're running impact investments, both part of Pitango, but really throughout your whole life you've been all about impact. Whether it's working helping evaluate ADHD through technology or helping create investment opportunities within the Arab sector in Israel through Pitango. So much to talk about, Cecille. And I'd love to then allude the conversation towards more holistically speaking about what it means to have an impact and be an impact entrepreneur on your side of the table an impact investor. But before we do that, Cecile, who are you? Who's Cecile? Well, very short. I was actually born and raised in France. Came to Israel as a child. Spent my whole life here and went through the whole cycle: education, army, and university, etc. I've always been an entrepreneur in everything I did. And somehow life led me to become founder and manager of some startup companies. Got into the hustle of the dot-com bubble, in and out. And after that, was very lucky to join the Noaber Foundation, which is a foundation that focused on the early, early stages of impact investing, or what we now call impact investing. So, I've really done so many interesting things and it's been a hell of a ride. And I try to reinvent myself every 10 years or so, so it makes it ... I love that. I love that. Let's start with talking about what is impact investing, and then maybe we can dive deep into some of the different projects you've worked on and are still working on and always draw back on how that fits into the bigger picture of what does impact investing mean. Sure. So, first of all, impact investing has a Wikipedia definition. It's really the intentional use of investments in order to create a positive change to society or to the environment. Now, because it's impact investing, we're talking about financial returns. Of course, it can be different kinds of financial returns. It can be lower or higher. It can be market trade financial returns. It could be any asset class that you could choose. And really, impact investing is about everything we do. What I specialize in and really care about very much is impact tech investing, which is something that still is very, very much in the, I would say, in the shadows of impact investing. Because if you look at the whole the impact investing market, you'll see about $715 billion invested in 2019. Only two billion out of that are tech. How is that possible? I mean, how is that even Really? Yes, just think about it. With all the problems that we are facing in humanity and our planet, with the sustainable development goals which were designed and defined by the UN, which really are an opportunity of about $12 trillion from now until 2030, how is it possible that we haven't thought about blending high tech into impact and blending impact into high tech? So, really impact investing is about doing good and doing well in the most basic sense of the word. So Cecile, I want to get a misconception out of the way, because when we talk about impact and creating a positive change in the world, immediately I think most people draw their mind into nonprofits, charity work, donating money to help others. You don't really think about business and you don't think about financial returns, which is part of the responsibility of an investor, right? At the end, you want to see returns on your investment. At the same time, you're talking about making a positive contribution to the world. So, give me a little bit of context as to how these things don't necessarily have to collide. Yeah. So first of all, making an impact is something that is very broad. Impact is a word in the dictionary. You can make an impact by giving money away, you can make an impact by helping people, and you don't necessarily have to blend returns into that. However, impact investing really means that you want to blend those two. And actually when you are creating a solution to a problem, you need to look at the problem in a few different lenses. One is the business lens, okay. So, you're creating a product which is a solution for a product, for a, sorry, for a problem. And the solution you're creating is a business solution. It has to have a big enough market, it has to have a big enough opportunity, and a way to the market that makes sense with your product. Next to that, if you look at the same product or the same problem in social and environmental lens, and you define it by thinking about who your stakeholders are and who are the people you're trying to really serve, then you can very easily tweak your product and your business in a way that is very, very focused. This way you can really blend the two in a sense that you don't think about creating a business solution and then adding some sort of impact into it which might be a hurdle and might not fit what you're doing or might force you to maybe hire people you didn't want to hire or locate yourself in a place you didn't want to be located. Instead, it really has to be within the DNA of the solution that you're creating. Now, if you're a tech entrepreneur, and you see a problem that you'd like to solve, and you can see this problem also as a social problem, and you can understand who are the people who are going to be the beneficiaries or the stakeholders that you're going to serve through serving, addressing that problem, then obviously you're going to be able to blend the two in a way that maximizes profits because the more you sell your product, the more revenues you'll have. But also, the more people who use your product, the more impact you'll make. So, the integrated approach is what I'm looking for. 100%. You know one of the things that I became extremely curious about as I transitioned to my time from the IDF towards now, Palo Alto, and thinking about the things I want to create is, I thought there are so many different places around the world where a lot of the technology and a lot of the projects that I'm seeing people work on are very focused on the US market, for example, or consumer products within Palo Alto. And I'm thinking ... if we could only leverage some of this technology outside to some developing areas. For example, helping create sustainability for a billion people in Africa. And maybe you're not gonna charge a $15 a month service fee for another consumer product, but if you're able to improve their lives even a little bit and have them contribute a little bit to the product, you can become just as profitable as another unicorn in Palo Alto. And that's definitely something that I've been thinking about what types of projects I want to work on. But Cecile, I want to touch a little bit on your tangible experiences that you've had, both as an entrepreneur and as experience. Maybe you can draw back to the company you ran helping diagnose ADHD and helping that or through investments in the Arab sector. All right. So, first of all, I wasn't the manager. I was the investor of this company. And also, with regards to the ... fund, which was the first fund in Israel that investing ... entrepreneurs, that was also, the idea was to initiate and make it happen and not necessarily run it. It's really about disrupting markets. So, it's really about looking at a problem in a different lens and seeing underserved populations or underserved opportunities. Take the example of the Palestinian or the Arabs in Israel who are, until about 10 years ago, they were totally excluded from the high tech sector. Now, it doesn't mean that they are not good entrepreneurs or have amazing ideas or ... the talent and the ability and the stamina and everything you need in an entrepreneur to create really great companies. However, the paradigm was that these people are just not part of the game. The network isn't there, the understanding of how business works isn't there, the access to capital isn't there. There's a language barrier, there's all kinds of stigmas and paradigms that we needed to break. Now, having said that, 20% of Israel's population is Arab. So, how is it that 20% of the population does not participate in that particular high tech sector? It just doesn't make any sense when the high tech sector really needs good people, good entrepreneurs, good engineers, people with the ability to even access markets that Israel cannot access like the Arab speaking markets. So, and there you have it. The opportunities there, but nobody's looking at it because it's too complicated. It seems that you won't be able to succeed. You have this, again, paradigm in your head that you might not be able to communicate well. But actually, when you drop all of these, then you can really find good opportunities. So, same goes with thinking about a problem in a different way. So, the entrepreneurs that created the ADHD solution looked at the way that ADHD is being diagnosed in a totally different way and just decided to try to pick up on these computerized tests that children go through anyway and think about that in different ways of how ADHD is actually manifested in the brain, but also in behavior. And then blend the two and come up with a solution that is easy, easy to implement, easy to use to screen, and therefore easy to address, because it's not a disease. So we're not talking about treatment; we're talking about how to help people with ADHD really achieve the goals that they're trying to achieve with the condition that they have, which is ADHD, and can really be a huge benefit and not necessarily a hurdle. So, it's really about redesigning your thought process about a problem or redesigning a solution. Now, I do want to go back to your previous assumption. You talked about Africa and about developing markets and how would it be so amazing if you could just take these technologies that are applicable in Palo Alto and just apply them in emerging markets. And that is absolutely very, very true, and these are, again, underserved markets, etc. But, you're falling into the same paradigm that people think about when they think about impact. Immediately their minds takes them either to think about philanthropy or thinking about emerging markets. But, you know what? Is there poverty in the US? Is there inability to access good education in the US or in Europe? Is there a problem of gender equality? Is there a problem of equal opportunities in cities? All these problems exist everywhere. So, when I think about an impact entrepreneur or somebody who comes in with a solution to a problem, I don't really care what kind of geography he's addressing or she's addressing. Actually, I think that we, as investors, unless we have a clear focus on a certain geography or a certain sector, we shouldn't interfere with what the entrepreneurs come up with. And if they think that their market is based in Germany, then so be it. If they think their market is in India, amazing. But we need to make sure that the entrepreneurs understand the problem, they understand the solution, they understand their competition, the market, and they're able to deliver a solution, which is tech based in our case, to address that problem. So, in a way, you see that even you are stuck in the same paradigm of thinking about emerging markets, and a lot of people are there as well when looking at the Sustainable Development Goals, this beautiful design of these 17 very colorful designs of the SDGs. And immediately people say, "Oh yes, but this is emerging market. It's not me." But that's absolutely not true. Right. 100%. And I do have to say that, my personal thinking process through this is saying, Okay, as an entrepreneur, I want to maximize on the impact that I create with every hour that I work, right? And I'm thinking, of course, there are lots of issues, and what's been happening in the United States and Israel and all over the world in the past year, especially Black Lives Matter and the Me Too movement. It just brings up a lot of these inequalities and a lot of these issues. But at the end of the day, I'm thinking if I have a set of skills that I can leverage towards building a technology that can help others, I want to try and help those that are as far off from the norm that I consider as sustainable and as equal. And at that point, that was my thinking process, but I completely, completely agree. And I'm assuming that that is also a contributing factor to why a lot of people aren't considering too much going into impact entrepreneurship because they think, okay, if impact that means I have to go to the emerging markets, but I want to be in Israel or I want to be in Europe, so I shouldn't even try. And Cecile, that brings me to my next question, which is how do you personally explain that such a small fraction of the funds go towards impact investing? Or why is there such a small fraction of impact entrepreneurs in the tech sphere? Because I'm completely shocked by the number that you gave me before. All right. So, first of all I think there's much of it with what you just said, that people really automatically think about either philanthropy or emerging markets or things that they don't really do in their daily jobs, and therefore it's not for them. But except for that, when I think about impact, I think about DNA of an entrepreneur that's looking at a problem and is trying to address it. It's an interesting thing that a lot of the entrepreneurs are actually addressing the Sustainable Development Goals, only they don't know it. As a matter of fact, if you look at Israel as an example. So Israel has about 6,600 startups at any given moment. From research that's been done last year, about a third of them are actually, indeed addressing one, at least one of the Sustainable Development Goals. Only either they don't know it, or they don't know what to do about it, or they don't understand how that has anything to do with how they talk about their business. Or, even worse, they think that if they're going to be talking about the problems or the social aspect of what they're doing, then their investors are going to be saying, "Oh, maybe they're not going to maximize profits. Maybe we shouldn't touch it. Maybe it's philanthropy" blah, blah, blah. So, I divide my world into two categories: one is the impact natives, and one is the impact migrants. The impact natives are the ones who are really born into It's like natives, Internet natives, okay? So, it's basically your generation, okay. It's people who understand it very deeply, who see the world in a very holistic way, who understands that actually when you look at a problem or anything you do in life, it's always about everything. There is no like, you don't live your life in silos, right? You don't think to yourself, okay, now I'm this person who is at home and then I'm this person goes to work, and later I'm the person who goes out with my friends for a beer. You think about yourself as one holistic human being, right? And you do all these things with the same values that you carry with you everywhere. Same when you're a company. Then if you're a native, somewhere in your stomach, it feels that you're doing something that is good for society or for the environment, only you might not know what to do about it, and you will need some help of somebody who will help you verbalize it, measure it, track it, etc. However, it's a given, right, you don't think about it. Impact migrants, on the other hand, which is the majority of the market, and I'm talking about investors and the entrepreneurs and everything in between, these are the people who actually do have something with the Sustainable Development Goals, but again, they might not know it and they might need the support of an investor or a consultant or someone who will come to them and say, "Okay. You know what? Let's look at your product with a different lens and think about the stakeholders that you're serving when you're selling your product, and then blend the two in a way that's integrated. And let's see if that's actually within your DNA and your intention." And you'll find that the majority of these people actually were somehow natives, only they even didn't know it. So, with a good process of migration, you can really migrate them into understanding what is the impact that they're going to create, which sustainable development goals they can target, how that is really embedded into their business in the sense that when you take their business results and you look at them through the stakeholder eyes, then you can really understand how that impacts the world. And of course, measurement is key. So, if you don't measure, you obviously don't know what you're doing and you don't know if you're improving. And obviously when you measure, you have to measure the net impact, so not only the impact that you're creating, but also consider the potential negative impact you're making and discount it, and understand if you're not really creating by helping one, you're actually, let's save 20 monkeys and destroy the forest, maybe not. So, all these things are need to be considered. So, at the end of the day, it's a profession, and you need some professional help. But migration is where we can really tap into the mainstream VCs and the mainstream entrepreneurs, and you'll find out very quickly that these people are totally on board. And they're on board for various reasons: one is because they care about it, but two, is because they want to hire the best talent, okay. So, you're not going to be working for a VC or for a startup that doesn't have that embedded into what they do. You're not going to buy their products. You're not going to invest in them. So, for whatever reason, it's going to come and it's going to come fast, okay? Just remember that your generation, the millennials, are going to be inheriting $30 trillion in the next decade. And you do care about these causes, so I think you're going to make a big difference. 100%. And it's definitely become very, very evident that people, when they're looking to join different opportunities, they're not just asking what is the company doing, but they're looking for the mission behind the company. So, definitely mission driven. It's definitely something that I see for myself, 100%, but also for a lot of my friends, both from the IDF and from Stanford, that's something that it's constantly talking about how is this making a better impact. In the last minute or two that we have, I'd love to understand a little bit better the work that you're doing within Pitango now, one of, I believe Israel's largest venture capital fund. You're running impact and sustainability. Paint me a picture a little bit of the process that you're working. So, as you have startups that are coming to you, how do you even begin to assess on a due diligence process if they're making a positive impact, and like you're saying, also assessing the negative impact they might make inadvertently? Yeah. So, first of all, I'm super proud of Pitango and their decision to embed and integrate impact metrics. We call the ESG to SDG Continuum Strategy. And I think this is like so innovative and pioneering, Aad I believe that within a year or two, everyone else was going to want to do this because why not. We're not compromising any financial returns. We're going to make, to create much better companies. Why wouldn't anybody, like everybody should do it. So, how does it actually happen? First of all, I work with the existing portfolio companies of Pitango to think about how they integrate impact into what they're already doing. And I'm talking about early stage startups, but also unicorns. Just to give you an example, I'm working with Via, which is a unicorn, that is doing shared riding, and I'm looking at their business results and what they actually do in terms of providing transportation, which is affordable and accessible, and how that impacts their stakeholders. Of course it makes money, but it also makes an impact. And we make an analysis, and we make a measurement. Next to that, early stage startups, like even Zapata, which is a quantum computing company that is looking at influencing how material is being developed and how drug discovery is done. I mean, just think about the impact, the positive impact, that can be done with quantum computing. Now, with companies that are approaching us, first of all, we'd like to have as many impact native companies as possible approach us, which they might not have before I joined the team because they might not have thought that Pitango would be interested. And then, we are going through an assessment of thinking about their ESG, so that's really the baseline, and do no harm, of course. Then we try to assess which are the indicators in the Sustainable Development Goals that are relevant to their product and try to see how that integrates into our due diligence process. So, I keep repeating that word like integration, integration. It's really about integrating the impact into the business. And when we do diligence, we do the questions together. Then when we analyze it, we try to figure out in advance what is going to be the impact and what can be the potential negative impact. And we talk about it with the companies, and we try to get them to face it. Now, it can be something as trivial as not having enough diversity in your team. And it can also be something that says, "Okay. If I deploy this product, everybody else is gonna be out of a job." So, how do we make sure that we take care of the stakeholders and keep them in mind and are transparent about our decisions in a way that really makes a positive impact. Cecile, this was just wonderful. I gained so much inspiration for myself as an entrepreneur, and I hope that my friends watching this and the conversations that will evolve as a result of this discussion. I'm very excited to where things are headed, and I'm extremely excited to approach you one day with hopefully an impact native company and work together. But Cecile, before we go, I have to ask you for three words that you would use to describe yourself. Yeah. So, you know what? You asked me in advance and it's really tough. But I didn't give you enough time, so this is not a hard commitment. ... off the top of my head. So number one, I'm a relentless optimist. I know it's two words, but it is what it is. There's a hyphen in there, so it's one word. ... absolute optimist. I always believe that things will work out well. Number two, I really am a believer. I believe that people are good, and they're going to want to make this change and make this migration and that eventually impact will just go back into the dictionary as a word and everything we do is going to have an impact and a positive one. So, maybe I'm a little bit naïve to compliment the believer part, but that's really who I am. And the last thing which I think is critical, and we should all, I think, adopt it, is I try to be very, very authentic. So, I practice what I preach. I really try my best to be very true about what I preach to the industry. And this is something that without authenticity, we're going to see a lot of impact ... and a lot of marketing usage of impact. And I think this is a risk that we can't take. We have to be authentic about our intention and the way that we practice what we do. In a way, it's a hard thing to do because you have to be accountable for what you do all the time, but this is just part of my DNA. Cecile, toda raba, thank you so much. This was just wonderful. Thank you for being so generous with your time. I know how busy you are. And stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you, Michael. And really be careful with all these fires and stay healthy. Take good care, and let's make a lot, a lot of impact. 100%. Bye bye.
