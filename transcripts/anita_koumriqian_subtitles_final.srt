1
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,360
All right.

2
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,840
Anita Koumriqian, thank you so much

3
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,360
for joining me.

4
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,120
How are you?

5
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,560
Thank you so much for having me.

6
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,240
I'm doing well.

7
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,200
How are you?

8
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,120
I am fantastic as well.

9
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,000
Did I get the name right, first of all?

10
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,200
Anita Koumriqian, yes.

11
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,960
That's the American way

12
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,080
of saying that.

13
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,880
Wonderful.

14
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,080
And where are you from?

15
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,000
I was born in Iraq,

16
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,480
but I'm actually Armenian.

17
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,680
Okay. Wow.

18
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,320
So, we're talking right now

19
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,440
from the Alcorn offices, right?

20
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,960
Correct. Alcorn Immigration Law.

21
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,600
We're located

22
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,480
in Mountain View, California.

23
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,720
So, I got to speak

24
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,600
to quite a few lawyers through this show,

25
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,560
but this is going to be a special episode

26
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
because I'm going to learn

27
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,880
all about immigration law.

28
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,920
And specifically immigration law

29
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,600
in the context also of Silicon Valley,

30
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,400
which is hugely relevant

31
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,680
especially nowadays,

32
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,560
and I'd love to talk about

33
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,200
how it's impacted during covid.

34
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,500
How it's changed over, perhaps,

35
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,800
past the last decade or so.

36
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,720
And I'd love to hear also your story

37
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,440
about why you're working

38
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,880
in immigration law.

39
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,880
There's a lot of different places in law,

40
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,400
especially in Silicon Valley.

41
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,720
So, how about we get started.

42
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,960
Talk to me a little bit about your journey

43
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,080
and how you found yourself

44
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,440
working in immigration law.

45
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:17,880
Sure.

46
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,040
So as I mentioned earlier,

47
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,760
I'm an immigrant myself.

48
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,920
I was born in Iraq,

49
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,480
and my family moved over

50
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,760
to the United States in 1995.

51
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,400
My parents decided to make sure

52
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,240
that my two older sisters and I

53
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,360
could live an American dream

54
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,880
where we would leave a war ridden country

55
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,520
and come to the United States.

56
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,920
On the 20 year anniversary of us

57
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,360
being in the United States,

58
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,080
I graduated from law school

59
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,840
to really live that American dream.

60
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,040
So, growing up, I've always known

61
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,040
I wanted to do something to help people,

62
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,800
and when I was younger, it was always,

63
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,320
Oh, maybe I'll be a doctor,

64
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,280
maybe I'll do this, maybe I'll do that.

65
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,400
And it was about the seventh grade,

66
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
I was 12 years old,

67
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,840
I thought to myself,

68
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,440
I see so many of my family members,

69
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,120
so many of the people in my community kind of

70
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,560
struggle through the immigration field

71
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,120
of like, do we need a lawyer

72
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
Oh, I became a citizen,

73
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm getting my green card,

74
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,640
all of this.

75
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,800
And I kind of told myself, my parents,

76
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,760
and I was super young,

77
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,720
so I really didn't know.

78
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,240
My parents came to the United States,

79
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,200
struggled to get us here today

80
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,040
so that we can live our American dream.

81
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,920
I'm gonna make my parents proud.

82
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,600
Go to school.

83
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,320
Educate myself as much as I can

84
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,080
so that I can help people

85
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,160
like my family when we first moved

86
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,080
to the United States.

87
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,360
So, finished school obviously.

88
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,160
I went to UCLA for undergrad,

89
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,320
Santa Clara Law for law school,

90
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,240
and joined the immigration field.

91
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,600
And that's what I'm passionate about.

92
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,000
I absolutely love it.

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,520
I have experience practicing

94
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,440
family law as well

95
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,120
so divorces and all of that.

96
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,720
And I'm glad that I've done it.

97
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,760
I'm glad I have it in my pocket

98
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,240
of experience and knowledge,

99
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,360
but I love immigration.

100
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,400
So, can you give me

101
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,320
a little bit of context

102
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,720
as to the immigration situation

103
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,480
in the United States?

104
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,920
I know that it's a very popular topic

105
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,600
of debate, especially in politics,

106
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,920
but I'd love to understand

107
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,960
a little bit better

108
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,480
what is the immigration situation

109
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,200
in the United States?

110
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,920
The United States is known as a country

111
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,520
that hosts a lot of immigrants

112
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,240
from all over the world.

113
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,280
This American dream.

114
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,200
I'm originally from Israel,

115
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,640
even though I was specifically born

116
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,200
in the US,

117
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,840
but a lot of my friends

118
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,920
are immigrants to the US.

119
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,880
So, talk to me a little bit

120
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,160
about what's happening.

121
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,800
So right now,

122
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,160
well, for the past four years,

123
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,600
it's been very, very up and down

124
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,240
immigration.

125
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,480
Everybody, for the longest time,

126
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,320
has built the concept

127
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,760
of the American dream.

128
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,600
We want to come to the United States

129
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,920
and join the melting pot.

130
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,000
And that's really transformed over time,

131
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,040
especially now as America becomes

132
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,200
less and less immigrant friendly

133
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,000
unfortunately.

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But there's still hope.

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,720
That's what I tell people every day,

136
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,760
especially now.

137
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,120
There's still hope,

138
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,720
it just requires some creativity

139
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,960
of thinking outside of the box of

140
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,200
if we can't get you into the United States

141
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,600
with this type of visa

142
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,200
or this type of green card,

143
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,880
let's think how else we can work with you

144
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,440
to get you into the United States.

145
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,920
Every presidential candidacy

146
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,400
has their own agendas

147
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,640
in terms of immigration

148
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,600
and some are better than others.

149
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,360
And being in the immigration field,

150
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,160
you have to learn to go with the flow.

151
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,280
Every four years you have to adapt.

152
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,400
Every four years.

153
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,080
Sometimes eight years.

154
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,800
And yeah, you have to adapt.

155
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,920
You have to learn to, sometimes,

156
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,680
go with the punches

157
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,360
and swerve around them.

158
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,000
Since March specifically, and covid,

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,960
it's been especially difficult.

160
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,600
In my years of being

161
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,640
an immigration attorney,

162
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,280
there's never been such a volatile time

163
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,640
to be an immigration attorney

164
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,000
where I feel like every single day

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,400
we kind of have to keep our ears peeled to see

166
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,040
is there something new going on,

167
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,400
is there a new proclamation,

168
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,760
is there a new order,

169
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,400
what can we, what is going on that

170
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,120
we have to let our clients know about.

171
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,440
So, I feel like I've partially also

172
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,640
turned into a journalist

173
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,480
where we hear everything,

174
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,440
and then we try to put it in our own words

175
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,680
and send it out in a newsletter

176
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,160
to our clients and people in our network.

177
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,960
So for those watching,

178
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,240
before we dive deep into more of the work

179
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,760
of an immigration law,

180
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,480
can you explain a little bit better

181
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,560
why is there a controversy

182
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,320
in the democratic nation

183
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,600
of the United States,

184
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,440
a democracy,

185
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,960
and the American dream is something

186
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
that every person in the world, I think,

187
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,320
learns about when they think

188
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,480
of the United States.

189
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,160
What has been so controversial

190
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,120
about immigration

191
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,920
over the past several decades?

192
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,200
And why is it even an issue?

193
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,400
I mean it's an issue because,

194
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,000
in my opinion, it's a silly issue,

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,560
but it's the fear,

196
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,960
it's the protection of

197
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,320
American jobs, really.

198
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,760
It's the protection of our economy

199
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,560
of people coming to the United States,

200
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,480
whether it be legally or illegally,

201
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,360
and taking American jobs

202
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,680
which, in every immigration attorney's eyes

203
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,160
or every immigrant's eyes themselves,

204
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,120
is not really is not a thing.

205
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,640
I'm trying to stay as apolitical

206
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,840
as I possibly can during this.

207
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,320
Of course. Of course.

208
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,080
It's just out of fear

209
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,160
of protection of American jobs,

210
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,600
the American economy.

211
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,960
And I believe

212
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,800
that's what it really stems from.

213
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,040
So, with Democrats in office,

214
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,480
there's a different agenda.

215
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,280
There's a different mind frame

216
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,040
whereas when there is

217
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,240
conservative Republicans in office,

218
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,600
there's a different agenda

219
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,360
and a different mind frame.

220
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,720
And so that's the adaptability

221
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,680
that we're talking about.

222
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,720
And then, so, what is the privilege

223
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,520
that you have

224
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,680
as an immigration law attorney?

225
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,600
Is your primary job helping people

226
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,200
fulfill their goal

227
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,880
of coming into the US legally?

228
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,640
Absolutely.

229
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,040
So, what our goal is,

230
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,720
and what I always tell people,

231
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,760
at Alcorn Immigration Law,

232
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,880
what we focus on is helping individuals

233
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,080
come to the United States

234
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,480
to live their American dream

235
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,720
regardless of their geographic location,

236
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,840
their place of birth,

237
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,920
what their passport looks like.

238
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,960
We help individuals, employers,

239
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,040
employees immigrate here,

240
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,240
legally of course,

241
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,400
so that they can come here,

242
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,760
live here, stay here, work here.

243
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,880
And that's what we focus on.

244
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,720
Again, we do both

245
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,960
employment based immigration

246
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,440
as well as family based immigration

247
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,600
because while they're both

248
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,160
under the immigration law umbrella,

249
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,920
they're vastly different

250
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,480
types of immigration.

251
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,440
Right. So being in Silicon Valley,

252
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,280
what is the difference

253
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,400
between speaking to you

254
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,320
that you're based in Mountain View,

255
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,440
versus if I were to speak

256
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,680
to an immigration law attorney

257
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,200
let's say in Michigan or in Boston?

258
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,240
So, it really depends

259
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,040
on the immigration attorney

260
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,680
and the abilities that they have

261
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,640
to work remotely.

262
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,400
Right now, everybody is working remote.

263
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,200
But what we pride ourselves

264
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,800
on, being in the Silicon Valley, is that

265
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,560
we try to be as cutting edge as we can.

266
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,400
We have to work with,

267
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,280
and not necessarily compete with,

268
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,720
but keep up with the tech companies.

269
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,480
So, since the very start

270
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,680
or birth of Alcorn Immigration Law,

271
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,520
we have been fully remote.

272
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,480
We help people worldwide.

273
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
I've had clients

274
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,280
literally next door to our office

275
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,400
and I have clients in Brazil, Germany,
- Oh, wow

276
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,320
China, all around the world,

277
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,000
which makes my job so fun

278
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,480
because I get to work with people

279
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,360
worldwide.

280
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,240
And whether or not

281
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,360
they're local or not local

282
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,480
makes absolutely no difference to us.

283
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,680
We have adapted

284
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,640
to a fully remote environment.

285
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,920
But still, I'm assuming that

286
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,320
the majority of your practice

287
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,600
is people that want to relocate

288
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,240
to Silicon Valley?

289
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,320
I'm sorry. Yes.

290
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,760
So, most of the time

291
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,240
we practice specifically

292
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,400
inbound immigration.

293
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,640
We do not do out immigration.

294
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,520
So, it's people coming

295
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,480
to the Silicon Valley.

296
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,240
Most of the time it's the Silicon Valley.

297
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,960
Otherwise it's,

298
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,760
I'm moving to the United States,

299
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,680
I'm going to work

300
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,960
for an employer in Michigan,

301
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,120
and we can help them.

302
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,920
I'm going to come and join my spouse

303
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,960
who lives in Texas,

304
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,720
and we can help them.

305
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Right. Is it really complicated?

306
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Is it really complex getting authorization

307
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,280
to move to the US?

308
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,400
It is.

309
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,240
It's complex

310
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,600
in that there's always

311
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,360
so many different moving parts

312
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,760
and there's so many different hoops

313
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,600
that you have to jump through.

314
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,040
Whenever I'm talking to clients

315
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,280
or potential clients or anybody

316
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,280
about immigration, I always tell them,

317
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,680
What do you want to invest in? or

318
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,000
How do you want to invest?

319
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,880
Do you want to invest

320
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,200
your time, your energy,

321
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,840
your Google abilities to figure out

322
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,160
how to file this application,

323
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,640
how to get into the United States?

324
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,880
And you want to do it yourself?

325
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,360
Or do you just want to invest your money

326
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,960
and just have an immigration professional

327
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,200
do the work for you

328
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,240
so that you can put your head

329
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,920
down on a pillow and know they've got it,

330
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,840
they're taking care of me,

331
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,160
I don't have to worry about that.

332
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,440
So, I mean call me biased,

333
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,240
but if I were not an immigration attorney.

334
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,160
I mean, kind of like with my taxes.

335
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,600
I don't file my own taxes.

336
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,760
I do not trust myself.

337
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,840
I will convince myself

338
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,600
that I'm going to do something

339
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,640
where they're gonna come and say,

340
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,920
"Hey Anita, you're going to jail

341
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,600
because you didn't file your taxes."

342
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
Scary. Right.

343
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,080
And this is a life of decision.

344
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,480
This is a dramatic, dramatic thing.

345
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,400
Yes, absolutely.

346
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,160
It's vital to make sure

347
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,320
that you're doing it correctly.

348
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,160
So maybe in a high level,

349
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,400
without necessarily diving too deep,

350
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,960
If I'm coming now,

351
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,100
let's say I'm from Holland,

352
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,520
and I want to come to Silicon Valley

353
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,120
because I potentially want

354
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,040
to start a startup

355
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,440
and relocate to Palo Alto.

356
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,320
Or to Michigan,

357
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,760
which is also great tech hub.

358
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,160
What are some of the biggest steps

359
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,960
or biggest hurdles

360
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,320
that I might have to go through

361
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
until I become a US citizen?

362
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,360
So first, the first step, obviously,

363
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,560
is finding an employer

364
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,680
who will sponsor you

365
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,040
to come into the United States,

366
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,280
with either a temporary non-immigrant visa

367
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,840
or with an immigrant visa,

368
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,160
which is also known as a green card.

369
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,520
So they're two separate kind of things. There's visas-

370
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,120
What does that main sponsor?

371
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,680
I've heard this term quite a few times.

372
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,560
What does it mean for a company

373
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,000
to sponsor somebody?

374
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,560
So, in order for somebody

375
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,880
to enter the United States,

376
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,080
whether it's through

377
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,560
an employer employee relationship

378
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,120
or a family relationship,

379
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,760
you have to file an underlying petition

380
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,320
where somebody says,

381
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,400
"I'm a United States employer,

382
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,920
and I want that person in Armenia

383
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,200
to come and work for me.

384
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,280
I'm going to sponsor their employment

385
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,160
here in the United States.

386
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,560
So, they're going to come

387
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,360
and work for my company

388
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,760
and only my company

389
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,280
with this specific type of visa."

390
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,040
And there's so many

391
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,840
different types of visas.

392
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,640
On the flip side, I can say,

393
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,520
"I'm in the United States

394
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,230
and I want my spouse, my fiancee,

395
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,960
outside of the United States,

396
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,440
join me in the United States

397
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,880
so that we can live our life here.

398
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,080
I'm going to sponsor them here

399
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,440
to come into the United States."

400
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
So, it's that underlying petition,

401
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,840
that underlying sponsorship

402
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,640
that will allow somebody

403
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,000
to enter the United States.

404
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,720
So, it's less of a financial.

405
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,360
It's not a financial sponsorship.

406
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,160
It's more of a,

407
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,440
"I'm vouching that I'm the sole reason

408
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,280
of why they want to come here."

409
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,800
Right?

410
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,360
Correct.

411
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,280
There's also a financial sponsorship

412
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,040
aspect of it

413
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,480
depending on the type of status

414
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,600
that they're entering in on.

415
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,720
If it's family based status,

416
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,280
then the individual,

417
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,320
that petitioner, has to pledge

418
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,840
if this person enters the United States,

419
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,960
I'm gonna take care of them

420
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,680
financially.

421
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,800
If they obtain

422
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,880
any kind of public benefits,

423
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,840
food stamps, welfare,

424
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,160
anything from the government,

425
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,080
if they get that,

426
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,680
I will pay the US government back

427
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,760
because I'm their financial sponsor.

428
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,480
So, financial sponsorship

429
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,280
is different than petitioning somebody

430
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,520
to enter into the United States.

431
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,240
Okay. And has this industry

432
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,560
evolved over the past, I don't know,

433
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,840
decade or two decades?

434
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,320
So, I'm always curious

435
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,760
when I approach new industries

436
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,840
that I don't know, and especially law,

437
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,040
which in my mind, I'm still thinking back

438
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,160
I'm imagining a law school

439
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,320
and dusty shelves and people

440
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,520
are just like reading books

441
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,600
and arguing in court.

442
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,640
Has this industry

443
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,440
evolved, immigration law?

444
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,160
Kind of not really.

445
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,600
Immigration is pretty archaic.

446
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,520
There is the Immigration

447
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,600
and Nationality Act that was founded.

448
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,240
It's the law that find

449
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,320
or founded immigration.

450
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,760
It was years ago that that was founded,

451
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,280
so it's kind of archaic.

452
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,760
The laws, the rules in there are old.

453
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,640
I think immigration

454
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,560
needs a home makeover.

455
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,880
It needs a renovation.

456
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,240
But it's so hard to do.

457
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,280
Immigration laws change a lot.

458
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,480
Immigration laws change often.

459
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,680
And specifically with, more recently

460
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,280
in terms of financial sponsorship.

461
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,840
There's a new public charge rule

462
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,200
that was buffed up just recently

463
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,000
back in, it started in October of 2019.

464
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,960
Really started in February of 2020.

465
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,120
It's now off again,

466
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,360
and it's going to possibly

467
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,280
be turned on again.

468
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,400
It's the new idea of self sufficiency.

469
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,600
When an immigrant is coming

470
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,160
into the United States,

471
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,320
they need to declare,

472
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,800
Hey, I'm young.

473
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,040
I speak English. I have a degree.

474
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,520
I'm gonna come into the United States

475
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,760
and I'm employable, I can work.

476
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,920
I'm not going to be a public charge.

477
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,960
So, they need to declare

478
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,240
they're self sufficiency as well.

479
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,960
So while immigration is archaic,

480
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,520
does kind of need reform,

481
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,240
if you speak to any immigration attorney,

482
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,280
at the same time

483
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,040
they are trying to adapt

484
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,040
to the times as well.

485
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,800
So, it sounds like a lot

486
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,720
of the complexity here for immigration,

487
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,400
and I'm getting a better understanding

488
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,040
of this here, is that a lot of it

489
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,440
is ensuring that,

490
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,720
is looking at the economy,

491
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,960
that's a primary factor.

492
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,920
It's looking at how much the government

493
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,160
will have to provide for citizens

494
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,800
that may not be self-sustaining.

495
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,280
And then I guess, your role

496
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,560
as an immigration attorney professional,

497
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,320
is to bridge that gap

498
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,840
and to be able to help

499
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,480
whoever wants to fulfill

500
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,560
that American dream

501
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,960
to show that they're able

502
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,280
to meet those requirements

503
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,760
so that they can get

504
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,120
the authorization, right?

505
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,320
Yes, absolutely.

506
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,120
And that's where our job kicks.

507
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,200
That's what our requirement is

508
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,440
as immigration attorneys.

509
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,920
It's our job to be creative,

510
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,280
to make sure that we're on top

511
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,720
of all of the laws.

512
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,480
Ethically, we are required to do that.

513
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,200
As an attorney,

514
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,760
there's so many ethical obligations

515
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,400
that we have.

516
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
... making sure

517
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,680
that we stay up to date

518
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,960
with the laws and making sure

519
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,200
that clients do qualify that

520
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,960
and doing what we can to be creative

521
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,080
and nimble with everything as well

522
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,720
to get whoever wants to come

523
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,040
into the United States,

524
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,600
into the United States.

525
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,040
How long does this process take?

526
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,600
It must take years, right,

527
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,470
to get this done?

528
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,880
Not necessarily. It all depends

529
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,240
on the type of visa

530
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,840
or the type of green card

531
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,040
that you want to enter in on.

532
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,040
So, it can take anywhere

533
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,080
from a couple of months

534
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,520
to like two, three years,

535
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,880
all the way up to like 20 years.

536
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,120
So, it all depends on the type of visa,

537
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,320
who's petitioning for you,

538
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,200
and how you're getting

539
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,080
into the United States.

540
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,560
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

541
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,720
And so, I'd love to hear a little bit

542
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,400
about your personal journey

543
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,200
with immigration law.

544
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,040
What part of it

545
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,720
do you really get excited about?

546
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,360
'cause obviously, you started law

547
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,280
not in immigration.

548
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,440
So you went to law school,

549
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,960
you go into family law,

550
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,280
and then you transition to immigration.

551
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,360
Have you always known

552
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,520
you'll end up in immigration?

553
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,240
Or is this something

554
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,000
that you stumbled upon and you said,

555
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,560
Oh, wow. I'm connected to this,

556
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,040
and this is something I'm curious about?

557
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,000
I've always known

558
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,240
that I wanted to do immigration.

559
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,400
When I first started working

560
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,480
in the immigration field,

561
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,200
I worked at a practice where we were doing

562
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,680
both family immigration,

563
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,080
family based immigration,

564
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,840
as well as family law.

565
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,680
I did more of the family based immigration

566
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,360
at that point,

567
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,560
but I would always beg,

568
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,360
"Hey, can I have

569
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,840
please have an immigration project?

570
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,000
Can I do this? Can I do that?"

571
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,840
And then I fully transitioned

572
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,640
over to immigration.

573
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,840
And now I'm a partner at the firm

574
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,080
that I work at,

575
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,120
and I absolutely love it.

576
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,840
And I wouldn't want to practice

577
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,080
any other field of law.

578
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,480
'cause for me,

579
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,520
immigration hits home

580
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,960
and I get to work with so many

581
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,400
different types of clients

582
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,520
all around the world.

583
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
And they are all

584
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,440
such a pleasure to work with

585
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,040
because they want to work with me

586
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,960
because they get something good from me.

587
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,800
They get a visa, they get a green card.

588
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,320
And it's fun and super rewarding.

589
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,920
As hard as it may be

590
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,320
to be an immigration attorney,

591
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,080
and sometimes I kind of feel like

592
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,880
the piñata of lawyers,

593
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,480
... so rewarding.

594
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,560
As a partner do you still do,

595
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,600
like what are the differences

596
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,280
and responsibilities

597
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,120
between being a partner at the firm,

598
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,040
being a paralegal.

599
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,320
I'm not really too versed

600
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,480
with how law firms work,

601
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,280
but just to paint a picture

602
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,400
of what your daily life looks like.

603
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,000
It all depends on the firm

604
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,800
and how they work, how they manage.

605
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,840
Partners oftentimes do more

606
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,200
of the higher end,

607
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,680
speaking to potential new clients,

608
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,360
doing more of the

609
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,920
business management aspect of it,

610
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,680
marketing.

611
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,200
But sometimes also do still get to do

612
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,400
pull up their sleeves

613
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,880
and actually get to work

614
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,040
on some legal work or at least mentor

615
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,160
to get some legal work done.

616
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,080
Whereas paralegals,

617
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,840
they're the ones,

618
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,880
they make the magic happen.

619
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,760
People underestimate paralegals

620
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,680
and how much they do.

621
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,520
So, I am so grateful for all of our

622
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,040
brilliant paralegals everywhere.

623
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,640
So, they are fantastic.
- I love it.

624
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,960
So, I know that I'm keeping you

625
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,600
one minute late

626
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,640
and I know you had a hard stop

627
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,000
that you have to run for a meeting,

628
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,440
but I have to ask you

629
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,560
the most important question,

630
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,400
and I'd love to understand a little bit better

631
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,360
about you through that, three words

632
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,720
that you would use to describe yourself.

633
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,160
And please elaborate a little bit

634
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,120
on these words and why those specifically

635
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,840
because I know you've put

636
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,960
a lot of thought into them.

637
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,080
Thanks.

638
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,280
So, one word I would say is passionate.

639
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,760
I am so passionate for what I do,

640
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,240
for the law that I practice

641
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,320
and the people that I help.

642
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,840
It's that passion that keeps me going.

643
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,280
Growing up,

644
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,720
I used to always hear people say,

645
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,640
"Anita, you have to find a job that

646
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,840
or a career that you love

647
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,640
so that you will never have to work

648
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,440
a day in your life."

649
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,720
It's going to be fun for you to do."

650
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,440
And I was like,

651
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,400
"That's not true."

652
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,480
There's no way that people

653
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,760
will actually want to work."

654
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,560
But it is.

655
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,280
So, if there's any young listeners

656
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,600
out there who are still trying to find

657
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
what their passion is in their career,

658
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,160
it is out there, look for it,

659
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,000
do not give up.

660
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,240
I'm empathetic.

661
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,120
I'm empathetic because I treat

662
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,080
every one of my clients

663
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,880
as if they're my own family members.

664
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,680
When I give my clients advice,

665
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,480
I look at them as if they're my mom,

666
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,320
my dad, my cousin, my sibling,

667
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,160
my best friend

668
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,760
because I know what it's like

669
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,000
to be in their shoes.

670
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,280
Being an immigrant is scary.

671
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,360
It's scary to be in those shoes

672
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,760
of really not knowing

673
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,440
what is going to happen with my fate

674
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,240
in this country

675
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,800
where I've worked so hard to get to.

676
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,600
So, you have to be empathetic.

677
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,680
You have to understand

678
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,440
why your clients are stressed out,

679
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,200
why they're anxious,

680
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,160
why their application

681
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,320
has to be filed today.

682
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,200
You have to get that.

683
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,120
And I'm hard working.

684
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,080
If I wasn't hard working,

685
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,960
I don't think I would be here today.

686
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,280
And it speaks for the approval rate

687
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,000
that I pride myself on having.

688
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,360
I try my best

689
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,040
on every single one of my cases,

690
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:41,720
and my passion and my empathy

691
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,880
all comes into it as well.

692
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,120
So, those are my three words.

693
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,840
I love it.

694
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,880
Anita, thank you so, so much.

695
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,000
This was wonderful.

696
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,160
I learned so much.

697
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,200
And I definitely hope

698
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,960
things will get better and easier,

699
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,400
especially for immigrants.

700
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,600
I can definitely testify

701
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,840
how wonderful of an experience

702
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,680
it's been for me

703
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,560
to have both my home country, Israel,

704
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,480
but also be in Silicon Valley

705
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,920
and in the United States in general.

706
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,480
And just recently

707
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,480
when there was the big announcement

708
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,800
that foreign students,

709
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,720
when it goes online,

710
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,600
they'll have to relocate

711
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,240
back to their country.

712
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,640
I was looking at a lot of my friends.

713
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,440
I was looking at my friends from Africa,

714
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,960
from the Middle East, from Europe,

715
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,560
and I was shocked.

716
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,960
And I saw all of a sudden

717
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,160
how things were falling apart

718
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,280
without their control

719
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,040
and it was very difficult,

720
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,720
so I definitely appreciate your work

721
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,760
very, very much.

722
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,600
Thank you for the insights

723
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,560
and stay safe and stay healthy.

724
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,000
Thank you. Thank you for having me.

725
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Wonderful.
