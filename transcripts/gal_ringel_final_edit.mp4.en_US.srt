1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,359
So, our job is to help

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,519
you do a data detox

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,279
and that's reduce the amount of data

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,759
that is out there about you.

5
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,559
But you decide

6
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,440
that this is the important part.

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:36,960
Gal Ringel,

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,240
thank you so much for being on my show.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,880
How are you?

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,440
Good morning.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,320
I'm great.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,200
Thank you very much for having me.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,720
Thank you for taking time to do this.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,280
There's a lot to talk about.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,520
I've been following you for a while,

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,240
and I'm a big fan.

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,640
I'd love to spend our 20 minutes

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,320
talking about your journey

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,560
from a technologist to investment,

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,800
to business world, now to CEO,

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,520
talking about that

22
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:01,279
non-linear career pathway

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,359
that comes up so much

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,239
from thought leaders

25
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,520
like yourself on the show.

26
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,160
And then I would also love to,

27
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,240
to talk a little bit about

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,381
the most recent series A investment

29
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:11,360
that you raised

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,920
completely through Zoom.

31
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,320
So, we have a lot to cover,

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,800
but let's go all the way back.

33
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,960
Gal Ringel, who are you?

34
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,920
So, I'd love to share a few words.

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,080
I mean, I think I'm biased,

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,240
but I think I have a really diverse

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,400
and I would call it a strange career.

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,160
So, it all started like 20,

39
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,760
25 something years ago,

40
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,560
when I was 8 years old,

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,360
where I've started

42
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,240
to write code and hack stuff.

43
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,840
Yes, I know,

44
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,040
it's on a really young age.

45
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,920
But this is what got me eventually

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,320
to [--] to the 8200 units,

47
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,840
in the Israeli army.

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,400
I'm sure you're probably familiar

49
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,960
with that unit, right?

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,560
Yes. Yes.

51
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,600
I got to be there myself.

52
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,320
But tell me, how did you get

53
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,080
to start coding at eight years old?

54
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,840
How does that even happen?

55
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,680
So, I'm a gamer,

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,160
I used to play Counterstrike

57
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,040
back in the days.

58
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,400
And actually this got me

59
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,400
to land my first job

60
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,880
in one of the leading

61
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,520
gaming companies in Israel.

62
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,240
We actually did

63
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,840
LAN parties and, you know,

64
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,680
back in the days

65
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,520
where people brought

66
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,840
their computers and big screens.

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,400
And I was basically in charge

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,920
of running all the networks

69
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,000
and all the server.

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,560
This is how I learned networks

71
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,360
and routers

72
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,200
and even to code some of the things

73
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,240
on the Counterstrike servers.

74
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,720
Wow.

75
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,520
So, yeah, it's a bizarre story,

76
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,040
but this is how I got to the coding world

77
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,680
and this is what developed later on

78
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,400
to start hacking stuff.

79
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,040
So, now, when you're

80
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
saying hacking stuff,

81
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
give me a little bit of context.

82
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,960
Because when I'm imagining

83
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,800
an eight year old hacking stuff,

84
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,200
that doesn't really add up in my mind.

85
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,840
What does that actually mean to you?

86
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,480
So, I'm talking about around

87
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,480
the age of 12, not eight.

88
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,880
This is where I start to hack stuff

89
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,960
and I'm talking about security hacking.

90
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,480
So,

91
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,320
back in the days

92
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,360
when the Internet started,

93
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,960
the Internet didn't have any

94
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,720
proper security in place.

95
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,120
So, I started to

96
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,440
test my skills.

97
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
I don't know if you remember,

98
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,160
but once we were downloading things

99
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,800
to like PPP servers

100
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,200
before [--] and that

101
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,040
world.

102
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,240
So, we started to hack stuff

103
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,040
and, you know, train my skills.

104
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,040
Yeah.

105
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,760
So, this is how it started.

106
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,440
Wow. Okay.

107
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,040
So, you're 12 years old,

108
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
you're into gaming,

109
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,440
you're into hacking and coding,

110
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,200
you get into the 8200 unit,

111
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,360
you spend a few years as a captain

112
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,000
in that unit,

113
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,880
so, you're really honing

114
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,800
your technology skills

115
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,920
both in terms of, you know,

116
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,640
leading teams but also hands on learning.

117
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,680
And then you make this interesting

118
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,840
quick transition to the business world.

119
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,520
So, again, a nonlinear career pathway.

120
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,760
How do you find yourself then

121
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,960
going into investments?

122
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,160
And I believe you were in Verizon, right?

123
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,200
And you were an investment principal

124
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,560
in various places,

125
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,240
how do you get there?

126
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,960
So, it's a really good story.

127
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,120
I mean, after 10 years of hands on

128
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,440
developing or dealing with technology,

129
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,520
I just woke up one day and decided

130
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,920
that I want to change something

131
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,840
in my career path.

132
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,400
I was really good in technology,

133
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,640
but I didn't want to take that

134
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,160
to the next level and, you know,

135
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,560
be a VP R&D, or a CTO.

136
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,200
I decided I want to take my tech skills

137
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,880
and leverage that on the business side.

138
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,160
But as you mentioned,

139
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,440
I had to go study that somehow.

140
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,720
So,

141
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,720
I had my first

142
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,000
computer science degree,

143
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,080
but I didn't want to go

144
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,520
and do MBA back then.

145
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,040
So, yeah.

146
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,960
So, I found myself joining

147
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,320
the venture capital community.

148
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,000
I started with Nielsen,

149
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,920
the market research company,

150
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,720
for two years

151
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,040
doing early stage investment.

152
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,520
And then I moved on to Verizon Ventures,

153
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:10,159
as you mentioned,

154
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,000
doing later stage investments.

155
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,040
And I think what's so special

156
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,320
about that four and a half years

157
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,920
is that I had a really

158
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,760
amazing chance to get a glimpse

159
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,640
into the startup ecosystem by investing

160
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,680
in early stage, later stage companies

161
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,880
and to learn business skills,

162
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,080
product, marketing, hiring,

163
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,400
I sit in board meetings,

164
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,320
and eventually in foreign affairs.

165
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:36,559
I had the chance to invest

166
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,600
in 20 companies.

167
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,360
So, I saw them developing

168
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,320
and advancing

169
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,960
from the very early stage

170
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,680
to the very growth stage.

171
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,320
And I think for me,

172
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,720
an amazing experience

173
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,640
to acquire a lot of skillset

174
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,520
that I'm using,

175
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,160
that I'm putting into action right now.

176
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,480
So, you pretty much created

177
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,240
your own form of MBA, right?

178
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,840
It's a really interesting path

179
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,400
that you spend

180
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,040
quite a few years in technology.

181
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,280
It's not like one or two, right?

182
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,320
It's many years in technology.

183
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,360
You reach a certain level.

184
00:06:12,361 --> 00:06:13,799
You are comfortable enough to go

185
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,680
and execute on a lot of these issues.

186
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,360
But then you find yourself in a fork

187
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,800
in the road where you have to decide,

188
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,200
am I going to be a VP, R&D/CTO?

189
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,440
Or do I actually want to be

190
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,520
on the business side of things

191
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,800
and know how to actually run a company?

192
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,600
And then you decide to go

193
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,040
into the investment field

194
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,360
and now most recently,

195
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,680
you're running your own startup.

196
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,000
So, tell me all about that,

197
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,920
because, first of all,

198
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,200
I love what you're doing with Mine.

199
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,760
I think that the story

200
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,200
of how you raise the money now

201
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,800
is fascinating.

202
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,840
But tell me a little bit about

203
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,960
how you moved from VC

204
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
to creating a startup.

205
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,880
So, after foreign affairs

206
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,520
doing investment deals,

207
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,360
I practically decided

208
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,840
that I'm ready to go back and do

209
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,280
what I'm really passionate about,

210
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,920
which to start my own company.

211
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,800
And so, I grabbed my two friends.

212
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,280
One of them, our CTO Gal Golan,

213
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,280
who and I served together in 8200 unit.

214
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,120
And we're good friends for six years.

215
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,320
He was actually my trainer.

216
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:12,039
So, everything that I know

217
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,200
in my cybersecurity side

218
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,240
is thanks to him.

219
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,200
And the third co-founder is Kobi Nissan,

220
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:20,519
who I met during my VC career.

221
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,040
He worked with Saban Ventures

222
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,600
and when the three of us sat together,

223
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,920
we knew that we want to solve something

224
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,240
that is very painful for us personally.

225
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,720
And after a few meetings,

226
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,600
we quickly discover that the three of us

227
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,880
really understands personal data.

228
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,560
And how valuable and precious is it

229
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,280
to each one of us on the personal level.

230
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,640
But we quickly realize that

231
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:48,039
three of us dealt with personal data

232
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,279
of different people from all kinds of

233
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,719
different angles through our career.

234
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,280
And we quickly realized that

235
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:56,559
we know how easily

236
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,559
our personal data can be exploited,

237
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,319
exploited against us as people.

238
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,759
And this is how we thought about Mine.

239
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,399
We knew that we want to

240
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,239
bring a consumer product

241
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,600
that can help people understand

242
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,840
what companies are doing with their data.

243
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,040
But not only that,

244
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,960
to take an action

245
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,280
and to do something about it.

246
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,080
And I'm talking about the end of 2017

247
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,440
where the GDPR was not legislated.

248
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,520
And as VC, we started to research that,

249
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,440
and we quickly identified that the GDPR

250
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,840
has made a history in the Internet

251
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,520
or changed the history of the Internet

252
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,600
because it's actually defined,

253
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,240
all personal data is our own asset

254
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,480
and it gave us powerful rights.

255
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,440
But here is a funny story.

256
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,560
We knew that that regulation

257
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,760
wouldn't be used by people

258
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,040
because it's very hard and complex.

259
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
So, to prove that,

260
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,920
we went all around Europe

261
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,520
asking people in the street.

262
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,680
Like we grabbed people in the street

263
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,600
and asked them whether

264
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,120
they heard about the GDPR

265
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,120
and whether they exercise

266
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,600
any of their rights.

267
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,760
And can you guess what was the answer?

268
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,480
100% no.

269
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,320
What is GDPR?

270
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,320
So, most of them did hear about it

271
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,240
because all they see,

272
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,040
all they saw was the

273
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,480
freaking Cookie consent

274
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,640
everywhere in every site, right,

275
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,880
where you need to allow all the time.

276
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,200
But none of them could actually

277
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,760
try to exercise these rights.

278
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,160
Some of them did try,

279
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,640
like a small portion

280
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,200
said that they did want to try,

281
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,880
but it was very complex.

282
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,520
So, this is how we knew that

283
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:43,039
we have to make it accessible

284
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,400
to millions of people

285
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,160
because it's a very powerful right.

286
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,640
And this is how Mine started.

287
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,520
Right.

288
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,160
So, give me a little bit of context

289
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,280
for those who don't still understand

290
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,240
the magnitude of the problem

291
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,800
of private data and personal data.

292
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,680
What is the trend

293
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,080
and how compromised is our

294
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,840
personal data in 2020?

295
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,160
So, it's a very good question.

296
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,640
So, data privacy

297
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,320
or data protection in 2021,

298
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,720
we believe that the entire

299
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,120
market is shift

300
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,680
from privacy into what we identified

301
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,160
as a data ownership.

302
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,800
And why do I say that?

303
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,040
If you think about privacy,

304
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,480
if we wanted to protect our privacy,

305
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,880
we had to prevent from our personal data

306
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,840
to be shared with others, right?

307
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
To install a VPN

308
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,760
or to use a dedicated browser.

309
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,440
But all of those solutions

310
00:10:39,441 --> 00:10:41,679
actually change our online experience,

311
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,640
right?

312
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,080
If you use a VPN,

313
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,720
to log into your bank account,

314
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,600
you would immediately get blocked, right?

315
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,480
So, it actually changed,

316
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,880
changing our online experience.

317
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,360
So, we wanted to design a product

318
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,520
that blends into your day-to-day

319
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,200
and doesn't change any,

320
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,200
any of your behavior.

321
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,280
I mean, we want to sign up to services,

322
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,400
we want to purchase things online,

323
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:06,639
we want to give our data,

324
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,200
but we identify that the problem is

325
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,360
to manage our data

326
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,400
on an ongoing basis.

327
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,960
And just to give you one

328
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,640
interesting insight,

329
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,160
can you guess how many companies

330
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,240
hold the average user data?

331
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,920
And I'm talking about

332
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,120
companies that have

333
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,600
actively collected your data

334
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,760
from sign ups, purchases,

335
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,720
things that you are doing

336
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,760
on your day to day, not passive.

337
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,080
How many companies have that?

338
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,760
That's a question?

339
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,400
Wow.

340
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,200
I mean, as a developer myself,

341
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,240
I would imagine that at least

342
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:44,839
90% of the companies

343
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,320
that I'm actively seeing in my day to day

344
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,320
have a lot of personal information

345
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,640
about me.

346
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,559
So, we actually have the number.

347
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,880
So, the

348
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,440
worldwide average

349
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,160
digital footprint consist of

350
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,600
350 companies.

351
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,920
So, 350 companies?

352
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,960
350 companies that's holding

353
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,080
your set of data.

354
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,960
It can be email plus any other thing,

355
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,160
passport, social security number,

356
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,200
date of birth.

357
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,520
And in the US, by the way,

358
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:17,880
it's even higher. It's 550.

359
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,760
550 companies.

360
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,040
Wow, that's just scary.

361
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,240
Yeah.

362
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,280
So, going back to your original question.

363
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,800
We quickly identified that the problem is

364
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,720
managing all data on an ongoing basis

365
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,880
and how we can make sure

366
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,520
to leave our data

367
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,400
only when we actually still using it.

368
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,640
And this is why we develop MIne.

369
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,400
So, Mine in [--],

370
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,640
is smart data assistant

371
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,960
that blends into your day to day

372
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,080
and allows you to always know

373
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,360
where your data is

374
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,040
and who has what about you.

375
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,760
Now Gal, I do want to make a distinction.

376
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,480
It's important for me

377
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,400
to make a distinction here

378
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,360
because I think that,

379
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,760
it almost feels like the world

380
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,960
is now split into two types of people.

381
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,240
There's the people that love the fact

382
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,520
that their data is being shared

383
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,200
and is being used by services,

384
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,320
and then there's the other people

385
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,720
that feel like okay,

386
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,800
we're losing our privacy,

387
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,640
companies are going to misuse the data.

388
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,320
And obviously, I think we can both agree

389
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
that it's somewhere in the middle.

390
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,800
Right?

391
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,200
We want to enjoy having services,

392
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,040
leverage their knowledge about me,

393
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,320
so that they can personalize

394
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,040
my experience, whether it's offering me

395
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,520
sharing rides to my

396
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,960
workplace or whatever,

397
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,760
what is the next good purchase for me.

398
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,640
Obviously, there is

399
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,840
the misuse of data, right?

400
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
So, getting for example,

401
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,080
my election, my voting habits

402
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,120
to advertise for campaigns.

403
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,800
Now, I think that

404
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,080
what you're doing here is your,

405
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,000
what I love about what you're doing

406
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,160
is you're taking back control

407
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,520
over choosing where do I want my data

408
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,040
to be stored. Right?

409
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,800
It's not an all or nothing approach of,

410
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,440
I don't want my data

411
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,200
to be shared anywhere.

412
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,640
And we understand that

413
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,960
our data is going to be shared.

414
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,400
I want to be able to control

415
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,720
where it's going to be shared

416
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,440
in the world, right?

417
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:00,920
Yeah.

418
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,560
I am so happy

419
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,880
that you mentioned that because

420
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,520
to give back control to users,

421
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,400
we call it to bring you back the choice.

422
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,000
And what is so nice

423
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,200
about our product is that,

424
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,040
as you mentioned,

425
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,840
the world today is a binary world.

426
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,800
It's either we share our data

427
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,760
or we don't.

428
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,680
But what we wanted to do with Mine,

429
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,200
is give you the choice to decide.

430
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,520
So, the first phase is to

431
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,000
basically understand

432
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,120
who has what.

433
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,680
Right?

434
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,920
This is the accessibility,

435
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,440
the 350 companies

436
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,840
that most people don't have any idea.

437
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,360
And after you do have that understanding,

438
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,440
you have the choice to

439
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,160
take it back,

440
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,320
to take your data back.

441
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,480
And this is the control

442
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,800
that you mentioned.

443
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,720
And to give you all the data

444
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,680
that you need,

445
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,560
all the information in order to take

446
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,120
an informed choice,

447
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,960
and in order to understand

448
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,680
what services you need to delete

449
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,280
and what services you need to keep.

450
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,320
Because you either using them

451
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,000
or trust them,

452
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,160
but you have the choice.

453
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:02,759
We are not deciding for you.

454
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,759
But we will be there

455
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,400
to alert you all the time

456
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,960
that it's changing.

457
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,920
Because today you can use a service

458
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,760
and in a few weeks

459
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,240
you can stop using that.

460
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,320
So, why give them the chance

461
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,960
to keep holding your data.

462
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,880
Because every day

463
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,160
there's a new data breach

464
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,280
and a new privacy scandal.

465
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,520
And you mentioned the election.

466
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,440
So, our job is to help you

467
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,520
do a data detox,

468
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,280
and that's reduce the amount of data

469
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,720
that is out there about you.

470
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,560
But you decide,

471
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,040
and this is the important part.

472
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,560
I think that's just remarkable.

473
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,720
I know we can talk about hours.

474
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,040
We can talk about data for hours.

475
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,240
And I think that what you're doing

476
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,840
is insanely relevant.

477
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,640
I'm guessing that

478
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,040
it's an exponential growth,

479
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,800
the amount of data

480
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,880
that is being stored on us.

481
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,040
Right?

482
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,320
With every new platform that comes up,

483
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,040
we're inventing new data types

484
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,960
that are being shared about us.

485
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,120
And I remember distinctly

486
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,800
with Cambridge Analytica,

487
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,200
when the report came out in 2016,

488
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,400
just how much knowledge

489
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,520
they had on so many people.

490
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,120
You know, things

491
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,400
your risk-takes that

492
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,000
that the person never even shared,

493
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,520
they never even necessarily

494
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
shared with them

495
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,800
what their favorite color is.

496
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,080
But they use your risk-takes

497
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,120
to think about that.

498
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,960
But Gal, I have to spend a few minutes

499
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,200
talking about your most recent

500
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:16,679
series A raise.

501
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,479
Because it's phenomenal

502
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,639
to be able to do it.

503
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,719
It's even more phenomenal

504
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,000
to do it all over Zoom.

505
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,240
So, tell me what happened over there.

506
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,000
So, this is a really interesting story,

507
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:31,479
because in the middle of it,

508
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,159
somehow covid started.

509
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,439
But if I take you a few months back.

510
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,120
After we raised our seed round

511
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,280
in early 2019,

512
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,480
we worked for the entire year in stealth

513
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,640
to develop our product.

514
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,720
And when we felt it's ready

515
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,920
to hit the market,

516
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,440
we did our official launch in Europe,

517
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,360
but also in Productant.

518
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,760
We were very surprised

519
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,440
by the amazing traction that we received

520
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,120
in a very short period of time.

521
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,089
We actually won the first place

522
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,680
up of the day and week,

523
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,760
and second place up the month

524
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,560
on Productant.

525
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,760
And somehow it got a lot of attention

526
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,840
back to us from investors.

527
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,520
It turns out that a lot of investors

528
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,080
are monitoring Productant.

529
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,240
And so, we started to speak

530
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,360
with a lot of investors.

531
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,280
And I'm talking about

532
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,720
the end of January this year.

533
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,840
So, you know, I started to

534
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,880
jump on calls with investors,

535
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,720
I was not raising my series A,

536
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,680
just to share our story, right?

537
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:35,359
To share the vision,

538
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,080
what we are after,

539
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,160
and to develop relationships

540
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,960
with those investors.

541
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,720
And then covid arrived,

542
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,080
I'm talking about March 1st,

543
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,120
covid hits Europe probably, right?

544
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,360
And three weeks later

545
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,920
in the US as well.

546
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,400
And I actually felt how the entire VC,

547
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,120
the entire worldwide VC community

548
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,320
is like shut down

549
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,760
or getting into a worldwide freeze.

550
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,840
So, similarly to us being locked down

551
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,840
in the first lock down,

552
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,640
I felt how the entire VC community

553
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,360
got into a worldwide freeze

554
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,240
and it's really understandable.

555
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,760
Most of them had to assess

556
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,040
their portfolio damages

557
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,840
and to quickly develop

558
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,480
a plan to help the companies in it.

559
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,320
I have to say that, you know,

560
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,640
it was a very special time.

561
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,440
I'm a senior associate

562
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,480
in an early stage VC firm in Palo Alto.

563
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,760
And I distinctly remember the confusion

564
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,600
of what's unraveling.

565
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,880
And here we are,

566
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,480
we have active investments,

567
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,560
we have LP's,

568
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,440
we have money that is

569
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,360
ready to be deployed into the market,

570
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:46,960
and all of a sudden

571
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,200
we think to ourselves,

572
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,480
what is our responsibility

573
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,440
and what do we do.

574
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,520
And one of the things that,

575
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,280
one of the key questions

576
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,760
you start asking yourself is,

577
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
well, how do we make sure that even,

578
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
like how long is this going to last?

579
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,159
And assuming that our companies

580
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,320
are not going to make any money

581
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,080
until this thing ends,

582
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,560
what is the runway that they have

583
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,520
and how can we support them?

584
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,040
And it was all a very confusing time.

585
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,320
So, I can only imagine

586
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,600
from a startup's perspective,

587
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,280
what does that mean

588
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,600
to now potentially go into

589
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,760
a series A investments.

590
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,640
So, you are very right.

591
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,040
And luckily for me,

592
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,800
I could play both sides.

593
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,320
Because I came from the VC community,

594
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,800
and now, I'm doing my own thing.

595
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,520
And I actually felt that.

596
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,680
And you mentioned

597
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,040
that you also worked in a VC,

598
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,880
so you know the financial model

599
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,160
behind VCs.

600
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,480
And you probably know that

601
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,680
we are raising funds for nine years.

602
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,320
Right?

603
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,800
So, I quickly understand it.

604
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,200
Covid, even if it's going

605
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,720
to last two years,

606
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,120
it's a really small bump in the tail.

607
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,560
Right?

608
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,640
It's not so hard for the VCs.

609
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,760
So, I just knew that

610
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,560
we have to hold down a little bit

611
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,480
and give the VC some time to digest

612
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,920
and to develop the plan they need

613
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,920
to save some of the companies.

614
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,160
Because some industries

615
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,840
were really affected by covid,

616
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,440
for example, the travel industry.

617
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,920
So, we started speaking

618
00:20:09,921 --> 00:20:11,199
with those VC's,

619
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,120
develop the relationship.

620
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,800
We knew that we have to stay a little bit

621
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,840
to give them enough time

622
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,880
to develop their own strategies.

623
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,440
But as you saw, most of VC

624
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,280
were quickly back in business, right?

625
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:28,399
I guess it took, what,

626
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,080
three months?

627
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,280
And luckily for us,

628
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:38,439
the covid was actually increased

629
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,239
the need for data privacy

630
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,839
and data protection.

631
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,560
You probably heard about

632
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:46,039
contact tracing, location tracing.

633
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:53,279
So, privacy was again in the major news

634
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,719
and it was really good for us.

635
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,799
And one of the investors

636
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,119
that we were talking to,

637
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,360
great investors,

638
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,560
we had like monthly update calls

639
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,960
during that period of time.

640
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,080
And around June,

641
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,440
we were lucky enough,

642
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,560
to even around May,

643
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,280
we were lucky enough

644
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,160
to get a term sheet.

645
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,000
And around June

646
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,160
to close the entire round

647
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,120
completely over Zoom.

648
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,079
Everything though Zoom, start to finish.

649
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,800
The leading partner, Darian Shirazi,

650
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,480
he never met us in person.

651
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,840
And we had another two VCs,

652
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,080
one from Germany

653
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,040
and another CVC from the US,

654
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,120
MassMutual and E.ventures,

655
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,480
they never met us.

656
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:32,800
And, you know,

657
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,520
coming from a VC perspective,

658
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
a VC background,

659
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,080
I never thought that investment deals

660
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,000
can be done remotely.

661
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,160
You always have to feel the people

662
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,680
and to meet them in person,

663
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,080
with something and the vibe

664
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,000
in like feeling them on their flesh.

665
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,720
Yeah. 100%.

666
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,240
So, it was a really

667
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,520
interesting experience to me.

668
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,400
I guess covid teach us that

669
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,320
we need to do business remotely.

670
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,000
We have to, because the world

671
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,800
have to keep moving on.

672
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,280
And I guess,

673
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,080
I experienced that firsthand

674
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,760
was a really

675
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,280
interesting experience for me.

676
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:10,999
I don't know if there will ever be

677
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,679
a time again

678
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,879
where deals of this magnitude

679
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,399
will be made entirely through Zoom.

680
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,319
I can't imagine a society

681
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,520
where people deploy millions of dollars

682
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,160
without wanting to meet

683
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,920
the other person in person.

684
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,120
But Gal, I thank you

685
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,880
for all the amazing work

686
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,760
that you're doing with Mine.

687
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,600
Thank you for

688
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,400
everything you taught me

689
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,360
through this 20 Minute Leaders.

690
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,720
I really enjoyed it

691
00:22:30,721 --> 00:22:33,079
and I can't wait to continue following

692
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,439
the company in your journey.

693
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,919
It sounds really, really amazing.

694
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,240
But before we leave,

695
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,760
I have to ask you for three words

696
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,480
that you would use to describe yourself.

697
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,160
Wow. It's a challenging one.

698
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,800
I would say calm,

699
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,680
it's the first one.

700
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,160
Maybe fearless.

701
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:59,800
This is something that the 8200 unit

702
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,000
teach us, that you can do anything

703
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,520
that you want.

704
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,440
And I would say something

705
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,120
that would surprise some people,

706
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,200
but funny.

707
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,400
So, I guess that the people

708
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,200
that know me personally would say that.

709
00:23:12,201 --> 00:23:12,919
So, yeah.

710
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,400
So calm, fearless and funny.

711
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,640
Gal, toda raba.

712
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,960
Thank you very, very much.

713
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,800
Best of luck

714
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,200
with everything that you're doing.

715
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,600
And I can't wait to keep in touch.

716
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,920
Thank you.

717
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,400
Thank you very much,

718
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,560
and I really invite you all to join,

719
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,600
saymine.com

720
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,080
and just take ownership

721
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,360
of your personal data

722
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,800
and really do something

723
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,520
for the first time.

724
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,360
I love it.

725
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,880
Gal, toda raba. Bye bye.
