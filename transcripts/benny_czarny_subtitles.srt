1
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,960
All right.

2
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,240
Benny Czarny, thank you so much

3
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,440
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

4
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,560
Michael, thanks for having me.

5
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,720
Benny, I just want to hear

6
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,560
about your journey.

7
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,720
It's very rare to meet a founder

8
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,400
that bootstrapped a company

9
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,320
from their living room as an engineer

10
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,080
and grew it to over a thousand customers.

11
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,760
Some of the most notable companies

12
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,560
that we all know here in the US.

13
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,120
But more importantly,

14
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,240
you're providing cyber security systems

15
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,760
for 98% of the US nuclear facilities.

16
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,920
Is that right?

17
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,760
That's correct. Let me just address

18
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,800
just one example.

19
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,160
So, our mission is to protect

20
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,680
critical infrastructure.

21
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,840
I mean, yes, nuclear facility

22
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,440
is one of that.

23
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,800
That's what, one testimony

24
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:40,000
of our success.

25
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,440
However, we do everything.

26
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,480
We do government.

27
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,640
we do [--], agriculture

28
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,720
utilities, other energies.

29
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:48,560
It's not only nuclear,

30
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,480
there is also renewable.

31
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:53,360
There is solar. There is tons.

32
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:55,520
Benny, I'm starting

33
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,400
with the most important question.

34
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,560
Do you sleep at night?

35
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,080
I mean, seriously, aren't you scared

36
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,800
about what you're doing?

37
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,640
This is crazy.

38
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:05,040
Yeah. I sleep really well.

39
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,640
There would be rare occasions

40
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,200
that I don't sleep well at night.

41
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,200
I like to sleep well at night.

42
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
Wonderful.

43
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,360
Okay, Benny, take me back.

44
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:13,840
Take me back

45
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,360
to the founding days of OPSWAT.

46
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,280
How does it start?

47
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,400
And what is your strategy

48
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,200
in building this company,

49
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,160
which now is huge huge success?

50
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,640
Great. Thank you.

51
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,480
So, how it started?

52
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,840
So, it all started with an idea, a vision.

53
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,360
Everything starts there.

54
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,160
So, also talk to your other person.

55
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,000
What do you want to do?

56
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,320
So, you want to go,

57
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,320
I mean, I knew, I think actually,

58
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,160
if you ask me when I was I think

59
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,040
it was sixth grade,

60
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,120
what do you gonna do?

61
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,520
I would tell you, I'm gonna go on

62
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,840
and build a cyber security company.

63
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,240
When I was six, I went and it was funny.

64
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,560
[--] a childhood friend

65
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,920
[--]

66
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,679
[--]

67
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,521
[--]

68
00:06:57,522 --> 00:06:59,650
Still happening by the way.

69
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,280
He also, he founded in,

70
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,840
then founding another company

71
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,080
in civil engineering

72
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,040
and we're still having that today.

73
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,880
Amazing.

74
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,440
Our wives are laughing at us.

75
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,240
Amazing. Okay.

76
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,280
So, you have this vision.

77
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,920
You have the strategy.

78
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,480
You're gonna build

79
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,440
a cyber security company.

80
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:16,880
But you do it in a very unorthodox way

81
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,000
because today it's diverse.

82
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,360
Every engineer out of 8200

83
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,160
wants to build a cyber security company,

84
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,680
raises a ten million dollars seed,

85
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,480
goes to series A

86
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
and sells it for $200 million.

87
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,320
You did something else?

88
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,160
Yeah. So, what I did,

89
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,320
I bootstrapped it.

90
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,360
So, I start with first the goal.

91
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,560
What was the global mission?

92
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,600
I said, "Hey, what can I do?"

93
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,120
Okay, let's see, what do I have here?

94
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,480
And when I started the company,

95
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,680
it was 2002.

96
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:41,360
I view, okay fine, I've got to go

97
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,880
and put something together.

98
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,960
I'm gonna go in and do it.

99
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,680
And I'm going to make it.

100
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,640
Could I raise money in 2002?

101
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,200
Yes, I could.

102
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,480
If I wanted to, I would focus on that.

103
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,480
I found myself much more battling between

104
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,520
selling the products to customers

105
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:58,120
willing to or ready to use the product

106
00:07:58,121 --> 00:07:59,880
and appreciate it,

107
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,280
to spending my time

108
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,960
actually talking to the investors.

109
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
And then at some point I said,

110
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,600
"You know what?"

111
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,200
"I'm gonna go and try taking the hard way

112
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,000
and then go all the way

113
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:11,960
without anything else."

114
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,760
It's not like a invested capital.

115
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,440
So, initially, what I did,

116
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,800
I provide some professional services,

117
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,960
not in that area, in other.

118
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:20,320
And I use that fund

119
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
or professional services

120
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,040
to hire engineers

121
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,640
to go and build the product.

122
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,040
I start eventually with one.

123
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,520
After that one became two,

124
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,000
two became four,

125
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:31,080
four became eight, and so on and so on.

126
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,440
Wow. So, there is no institutional funding

127
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,960
throughout the lifetime of OPSWAT?

128
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,960
No, not yet, no.

129
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:37,920
Unbelievable. Okay.

130
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,880
Now, talk to me a little bit

131
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,720
about about the journey.

132
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,440
So, now you have

133
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:42,160
over a thousand customers.

134
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,920
You are handling over 98%

135
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,720
of the nuclear facilities in the US.

136
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,600
How do you get to a level

137
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,040
where you're building the trust

138
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,760
where the US government

139
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,160
is letting you defend

140
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,120
its most critical infrastructure?

141
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,200
I mean, to me that sounds like

142
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,040
the highest level you can get to

143
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,960
as a cybersecurity company.

144
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,520
And so, it's all depends,

145
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,440
that might be operating principles.

146
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,160
Well, number one is the technology.

147
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,960
Be committed to the technology.

148
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:12,600
Yeah. I would hope so.

149
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,720
Number two is very much

150
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,160
the people on the team.

151
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,840
It's all about the people.

152
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:20,400
The companies for me, is the team.

153
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,680
It's everything about the team

154
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,560
that is being built.

155
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,000
Their motivation, their aspiration.

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,920
What do they do.

157
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,800
Whatever their kind.

158
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,480
Whatever we think.

159
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,040
Wherever they go.

160
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,520
And what keeps them up is

161
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:32,240
how to make sure

162
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,440
the product is competitive.

163
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,200
The product  is doing

164
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,640
what it's supposed to do.

165
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,480
We are very transparent about the product.

166
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,640
How? From end to end.

167
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,480
From marketing through

168
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,000
how the product is operating.

169
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,040
Three, we go to market.

170
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,000
The channel.

171
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,160
The how we go,

172
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,920
and very much selling the product.

173
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,560
They're out there.

174
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:51,600
How we reached out to these folks

175
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,720
of their needs.

176
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Right. So, how many people are involved

177
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,560
in this right now, with OPSWAT?

178
00:09:57,561 --> 00:09:59,005
The company we are over

179
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:01,120
321 employees today.

180
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,200
Incredible.

181
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,680
And growing.

182
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,920
Actually we have 30 open positions.

183
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,640
Despite the corona we are hiring.

184
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:07,960
30 open positions?

185
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:08,080
Yes.

186
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:10,680
So, you're looking to grow 10%

187
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,520
during covid-19?

188
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,880
Yes, we are. Yes, we are.

189
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,960
We are not, I mean, critically,

190
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,280
I'm talking to our customers.

191
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,120
I'm talking to customers in anywhere.

192
00:10:19,121 --> 00:10:20,520
They are going to the office.

193
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,400
So, [--]

194
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,880
Most of our customers,

195
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,840
we still have some customers

196
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,400
end of the day.

197
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,760
We are building a great product.

198
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,360
We have some awesome nontraditional,

199
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,360
critical infrastructure companies

200
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,080
buying our solutions.

201
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,600
So, they are not bank.

202
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,400
They are not energy, not utility.

203
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:35,920
Not to brag

204
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,000
because we have a good product.

205
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:39,960
Over most of our customers

206
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,640
are going to the office.

207
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,680
Incredible. Okay.

208
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,160
So, you know, I have quite a few friends

209
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,960
who have either lost their internship

210
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,000
or lost their job offer because things

211
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,440
have gone awry.

212
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,360
So, definitely, this sounds great.

213
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,830
But Benny, talk to me a little bit

214
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:58,320
about the cyber security space.

215
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,960
I want your earned secrets

216
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,800
over these years of building OPSWAT.

217
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,160
You're dealing with some of the most

218
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,200
incredible companies.

219
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,960
And you really are an expert

220
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,040
in the cyber security field

221
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,240
simply because you've been

222
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:10,400
selling in the field

223
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,120
and you've been developing

224
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:13,320
a cutting edge technology there.

225
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,280
What is the cybersecurity space today

226
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,360
like in the world?

227
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:18,840
And what are the biggest challenges

228
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,640
that we're heading towards?

229
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,560
If you're looking at the cybersecurity

230
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,120
from that perspective,

231
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,800
it's very segregated.

232
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,200
I mean, if I'm looking at company,

233
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,000
very segregate.

234
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,040
I see very very good companies all over

235
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,160
sometimes doing just one point solution.

236
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,360
That created very good e-mail security.

237
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,080
Create a really good antivirus

238
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,440
or a different point solution.

239
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,400
And if you're looking at the cyber map

240
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,120
you see more than 3,000

241
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,640
cybersecurity companies out there.

242
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,440
Maybe 500 are in Israel.

243
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,600
And then you're like, so.

244
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,520
And you see that.

245
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,360
So, what is missing from that perspective?

246
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,600
So, what's unique about us is very much

247
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,440
a critical infrastructure protection.

248
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,320
So, holistic view

249
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:02,160
on critical infrastructure.

250
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,920
We have two platforms that helps you

251
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,760
not only prevent spreads,

252
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,640
also create a process.

253
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,000
So, whenever we research

254
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,320
cyber security attacks, it's all about,

255
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,160
not only about defending,

256
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,280
it's also creating a process.

257
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,840
We go to CEOs, to IT managers.

258
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,320
We asked them,

259
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:22,360
"Who is bringing data?"

260
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,920
"Who is bringing devices?"

261
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,600
"What type of data?"

262
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,240
"Do you have a policy?"

263
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,320
You'll be surprised

264
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,000
that there is no single answer.

265
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,680
We are there to go and solve this problem.

266
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,240
Another operating principle

267
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:34,320
that I've seen is that,

268
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:36,720
there is not enough education system.

269
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,280
So, there is no training.

270
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,920
There is no official training.

271
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,280
There could be a training for a product.

272
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,640
Though there is no training

273
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,480
for the problem

274
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,360
and what you're trying to achieve.

275
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,320
So, on that also,

276
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:48,760
you look for example, investing,

277
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,480
[--]

278
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,200
So, it's all about training the IT folks

279
00:12:53,241 --> 00:12:55,160
for the critical infrastructure.

280
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,400
Now, I don't promote it to be here

281
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,720
just to promote, use that amazing stand

282
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,640
just to promote the company,

283
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,840
though, you asked me about how I see

284
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,800
the cyber security market.

285
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,200
So, I find very segregated,

286
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,240
very points focused,

287
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:07,840
very product focused.

288
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,960
not so much solutions for problems.

289
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,720
Obviously, you have the big folks.

290
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:12,880
You have the checkpoint of the world,

291
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:15,120
the Palo Alto of the world here.

292
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,920
The sister of the world, and you say,

293
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,560
"Oh, we do everything in cybersecurity."

294
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,240
So, this is more than the military.

295
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,120
You need cyber security,

296
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,560
you get the military.

297
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,920
And then you have the point solution

298
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,960
That is more of the products folks.

299
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,240
That's something that companies

300
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,480
doing something specific,

301
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,320
something is very good,

302
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,880
or a  one thing or sometimes two things

303
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,960
that they are repeating

304
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:38,280
and getting in the cybersecurity field.

305
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,560
Benny, it sounds to me, I'm coming

306
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,560
from the cyber security space myself.

307
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,760
But one of the things

308
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,560
that I learned quickly in my time in 8200

309
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,360
is that this world is changing constantly.

310
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,400
It's a cat and mouse game.

311
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,480
And new things are coming up all the time.

312
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,680
New technologies for every new device

313
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,480
that today, our fans are connected.

314
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,080
And I believe that one of them,

315
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,800
really mind changing moments that I had

316
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,160
was back in my course in the Army.

317
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,160
And we had a guest speaker who came in

318
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,080
and showed us a paper

319
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,360
that they wrote in the Technion,

320
00:14:11,361 --> 00:14:14,200
of how a ceiling fan

321
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:16,120
can actually transmit data

322
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,560
that you wouldn't expect it to.

323
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,760
And I was thinking to myself,

324
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:22,200
a ceiling fan can give me information,

325
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,800
the critical information about,

326
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,840
about whatever is happening.

327
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,000
And I thought that was crazy.

328
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,560
So, how do you manage that new knowledge

329
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,920
that is constantly being creating?

330
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,880
Because, you're only relevant

331
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,120
as long as you're up to date

332
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,880
with what's happening.

333
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,720
You have to be ahead

334
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:37,200
of everybody else in the game, right?

335
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,180
So, that's a good one.

336
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,000
So, for that, we keep innovating.

337
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,800
So, to a point that

338
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,960
we keep having new product.

339
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,360
So, by the way, during the covid-19,

340
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,040
we released three new products.

341
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,280
So, to the point that, we are doing it.

342
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,240
So, I completely agree with you.

343
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,920
It's keep changing.

344
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:52,600
The threats landscape keep changing.

345
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,240
Though there's something else interesting.

346
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,160
I've seen in cyber security,

347
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
sometimes is revolving.

348
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,720
So, what you've seen that,

349
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,680
something that what's happening

350
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,680
10 years ago

351
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,320
is coming back to light sometimes.

352
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,680
And I think for example,

353
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,840
data loss prevention

354
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,200
on some other technologies

355
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,400
that are keeping reinventing themselves.

356
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,880
And the reason for that is that

357
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:14,480
the IT is changing.

358
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,080
And then security needs to catch up

359
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,200
with the new IT threat.

360
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,960
So, for example,

361
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,360
mobile phone, for example,

362
00:15:19,361 --> 00:15:21,200
IT devices, [--]

363
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,700
So, the reason for that is

364
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,520
lies to what we do,

365
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,360
how we interact.

366
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:27,200
Work from home, for example,

367
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,440
is a different attack vector

368
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,320
for both productivity and security.

369
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:32,880
Of course.

370
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,920
So, that's it.

371
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,640
And now with covid that will accelerate

372
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,600
activities and productivities.

373
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,200
[--]

374
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,080
Interesting. Okay.

375
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,520
And how do you create a culture, though,

376
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,440
where people are interested in learning?

377
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,360
So, instead of just continuing to develop

378
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,240
the current software,

379
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,600
they're continuing to research

380
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,740
and understand what else is happening.

381
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,920
Do you deploy that through

382
00:15:52,921 --> 00:15:55,120
a specific division that is responsible

383
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,440
for new key findings

384
00:15:56,441 --> 00:15:58,120
or for learning, or do you collaborate

385
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,960
with academia and universities to see

386
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,440
what they're coming up with.

387
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,520
How do you maintain

388
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:06,080
the number one in the game?

389
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,640
Okay. So, there are

390
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,600
multiple answers for it.

391
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,040
Number one is our customer landscape.

392
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,100
We have so many deployments

393
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,680
that takes over 1500 customers,

394
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,360
to be precise.

395
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,240
So, we have lots of customers

396
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:18,480
and also products out there.

397
00:16:18,481 --> 00:16:19,360
Every customer

398
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:21,700
deploy our product in multiple.

399
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,920
Our products, some of them has,

400
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,960
I mean, you can enable sensors

401
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,920
to go and understand

402
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,360
what's happening there.

403
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,040
And the customers,

404
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,040
if they like to share the threats with us,

405
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,400
we get a lot of data from

406
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,200
first our customers

407
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
and they see what was it.

408
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,480
Number two, we have our own

409
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,840
big data analysis.

410
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,840
So, big data analysis

411
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:40,480
we have data from the cloud

412
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,680
you can go and share data there.

413
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,880
And from the cloud

414
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,800
we have tons of users.

415
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,360
We have a whole community

416
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,640
of voters there just talking about.

417
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,360
Number three,

418
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,440
we have a model sharing program

419
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,520
with very much almost

420
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,040
every antivirus out there.

421
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,680
So, enable for example,

422
00:16:56,681 --> 00:17:00,640
a vendor hired or sent you online

423
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:02,440
a Symantec, McAfee,

424
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,440
all of these products finding a threat.

425
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,160
We are oblige to go and share

426
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,920
threats with each other.

427
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,920
So, we research that.

428
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,320
And I think they're seeing, by the way,

429
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,120
in the cyber that is related to that

430
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,000
is that they also related

431
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,040
to the philosophy.

432
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,320
And also, if you talk about our success,

433
00:17:20,321 --> 00:17:22,480
it's our technology philosophies

434
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,590
surely zero threats.

435
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,240
So, we assume all of the files are bad.

436
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,070
And so, we generate them.

437
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,200
So, another kind of operating philosophy.

438
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,200
And we tested moving landscape

439
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,120
on the moving targets

440
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,720
and the moving threats

441
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,070
[--]

442
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,560
I love it.

443
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,600
Benny, I wanna move a little bit

444
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,360
to the entrepreneurial journey

445
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,280
and leadership.

446
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,590
And I'd love to know,

447
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,640
the traditional path that I see here

448
00:17:47,641 --> 00:17:50,200
is in the Valley and Tel Aviv is that,

449
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:52,440
you go, you raise institutional funding

450
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:53,960
and you move quickly.

451
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:54,920
And when you get to

452
00:17:54,921 --> 00:17:56,560
ring the bell at NASDAQ,

453
00:17:56,561 --> 00:17:58,440
like lemonade is doing today,

454
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,240
even though this is going to be shown

455
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,400
to the public later on.

456
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,200
But today, the lemonade is going public.

457
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,720
That's sort of the lifetime dream

458
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,480
of any entrepreneur.

459
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,400
It doesn't seem like that is necessarily

460
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,030
your ambition and your dream.

461
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,280
What is your consideration

462
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,960
for keeping the company private

463
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,030
rather than public?

464
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,720
And do you ever see yourself

465
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,440
going on to something else?

466
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,440
So, back to your question, actually,

467
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,000
now, there is a chance

468
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,040
We're going to public.

469
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,550
The order has gotten bigger.

470
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,400
A big O could be a big exits, too.

471
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,510
Could be a big merger with something over.

472
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,240
I don't operate this by, first,

473
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,880
I build the company to last.

474
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,640
I build the company last

475
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,480
with the good culture

476
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,160
with a good team,

477
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,120
with management team,

478
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,510
with a good business.

479
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,160
And that's kind of,

480
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,120
Where I get.

481
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,310
What's even for the employees?

482
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:41,720
Everything.

483
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,960
First, the equity that I provide

484
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
to the team members

485
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,680
is much better than diluting it

486
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,440
with some VC folks right now.

487
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,750
[--]

488
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,810
And whenever I keep asking.

489
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:53,440
I don't look

490
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,800
at the quantity of the stocks.

491
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,680
Look at their value,

492
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:57,360
for bringing in the case of an exit.

493
00:18:57,361 --> 00:18:58,160
Right.

494
00:18:58,161 --> 00:19:01,640
So, I have team members with stock

495
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,520
or stock options

496
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,590
depends on their situation in that.

497
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,290
And I believe that at some point,

498
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:06,880
we go further.

499
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,685
We decide to go to that [--] route,

500
00:19:08,686 --> 00:19:12,959
or we decide to get to the bottom

501
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,040
with the private equity

502
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,980
to go and get it, which is another option.

503
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,030
I build the company to last.

504
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,720
I think, I mean,

505
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,280
that's the most inspiring part.

506
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,640
You building the company to last.

507
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,030
I think right now,

508
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,080
especially what I'm saying

509
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,720
with a lot of my colleagues

510
00:19:26,721 --> 00:19:28,320
in my age group is that

511
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,040
you're not thinking about a company

512
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,840
that you're gonna be involved

513
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,640
with for 10, 15, 20 years.

514
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,600
You think about products

515
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,120
that you're gonna be excited to work on

516
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,080
for a year or two

517
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,280
and then sell or move on

518
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,120
to your next projects,

519
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:39,750
which is a very different mindset.

520
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,280
Benny, you moved from managing

521
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,800
one person, yourself basically

522
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,160
to now managing over 300 people

523
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:48,590
in this great company.

524
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,920
What have you learned over the years?

525
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:50,960
What surprised you

526
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:53,350
over things that you didn't expect?

527
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:53,920
It's covid.

528
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,510
Initially, I was very much of everything.

529
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,280
I was the big old guy.

530
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,310
I was the coder.

531
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,840
I was pretty much the HR,

532
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,070
the everything around it.

533
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,030
And then starting to get

534
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,880
a management team,

535
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,400
a professional management team in place.

536
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,750
The right system in place.

537
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,840
The banking systems in place

538
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
to go and put it together

539
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,840
to a point that it's,

540
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,440
and I see this journey

541
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,085
that been challenging me from, okay,

542
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:20,840
from doing work and it's actually changing

543
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,240
my kind of my day to day.

544
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,640
And I find it very fascinating.

545
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,750
I love it.

546
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,000
So, I find myself as, building careers.

547
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,440
And building careers inside the company.

548
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,680
I taught my executive these two things.

549
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,880
You have two honorable ways

550
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,830
to gonna leave the company.

551
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,920
Two honorable ways.

552
00:20:36,921 --> 00:20:39,680
Option one, you die.

553
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,400
It's honorable, right?

554
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:45,560
Option number two,

555
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:47,160
go find your own company.

556
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,440
Right.

557
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,040
And by the way,

558
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,360
it worked with two executives.

559
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,680
Two past executives.

560
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,640
I mean, they didn't die.

561
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,440
They opened their own company.

562
00:20:54,441 --> 00:20:56,680
Amazing. Successful?

563
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,800
[--]

564
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,480
They come over here.

565
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,070
We walk together as a team.

566
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,320
And after that, build your experience.

567
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,350
Then after five years,

568
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,400
they went, they build their own company.

569
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,960
I'm still in touch with them. Great.

570
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,830
This is what I call honorable way.

571
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,960
I love it.

572
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,000
Benny, what would be

573
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,560
the most important thing for you,

574
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,480
that if I would ask

575
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,510
any of your 300 employees,

576
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,590
I tell them, tell me one,

577
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,830
the best thing about Benny.

578
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,800
What would they tell me

579
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,960
about your leadership style?

580
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,240
Because I'm getting information

581
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,720
for myself.

582
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,160
I wanna be an entrepreneur myself one day

583
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,400
or continue being an entrepreneur

584
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,640
and create my own company.

585
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,400
And I'm thinking,

586
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,160
what are the most important traits

587
00:21:32,161 --> 00:21:33,320
that I need to maintain

588
00:21:33,321 --> 00:21:36,000
or uphold as a leader?

589
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,760
All right. So, I'm personable.

590
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,960
So,  with whatever I connect,

591
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm connecting with you.

592
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,110
Talk to me.

593
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,510
So, I'm very personable.

594
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,400
I'm very direct too.

595
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,750
I say, "Hey, I hate it. I like you."

596
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,730
I think you're not gonna it.

597
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,120
And I think that when you match that

598
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,680
with the personable, then,

599
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,760
they don't take it personally

600
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,600
because  you care for them.

601
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,040
It's the feedback you're giving them

602
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,840
is not against them.

603
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,160
It's perhaps critical,

604
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,800
it's perhaps criticism over the work.

605
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,320
But because you build this personal trust,

606
00:22:06,321 --> 00:22:07,640
then it's much more meaningful

607
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,310
to be direct, right?

608
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:09,720
Yeah.

609
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,320
So, that's on this one.

610
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,440
I'm direct and so on.

611
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,080
And then, I like to start to ask,

612
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:17,920
Why? What's in it for you?

613
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,520
So, connect to that point.

614
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:22,880
Also, I like to understand

615
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,360
what they like to do,

616
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,000
what they don't like to do.

617
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,760
People, usually they are good.

618
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,120
Usually, not always.

619
00:22:27,121 --> 00:22:29,880
They are good at what they like to do.

620
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,120
Right.

621
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:32,080
So, that's kind.

622
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,240
And they like to take jobs

623
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,200
I think that they're good at.

624
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,600
And I'm trying to just ensure it's there

625
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,720
and to provide.

626
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,240
I have managers that have been with me

627
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,520
for many years in the Silicon Valley,

628
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:45,640
which is tough.

629
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:47,520
They manage with me for 12 years.

630
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,840
And there is one excuse,

631
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:51,000
gonna go and retire.

632
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,960
An executive gonna retire

633
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,480
from the company.

634
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,160
I see it all this,

635
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,590
I look at it as an accomplishment.

636
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,960
Incredible. I mean, I think it's amazing

637
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,800
that you're looking at that

638
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,240
as a source of accomplishment

639
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,960
for the company.

640
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:04,680
I don't think that

641
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,360
many founders and leaders would see that

642
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:10,280
as such a great accomplishment.

643
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,000
Obviously it is.

644
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,160
But I think just their focus

645
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,400
maybe on other things.

646
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:13,960
But it sounds like

647
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
you're putting the team first,

648
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:16,760
which I think is so so cool.

649
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,070
What is it about, though,

650
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,160
the culture that's making them want

651
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,840
to stay for so long?

652
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,400
Because opportunities here are endless.

653
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,880
There's constant competition

654
00:23:23,881 --> 00:23:26,120
for the best talent, especially coming out

655
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,790
of the other great company like yours.

656
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,480
So, what do you think makes people

657
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,160
want to remain strong within

658
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,070
a company that like OPSWAT?

659
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,720
So, number one is our mission, right?

660
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,280
You want to be identify yourself

661
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,980
with the mission of the company.

662
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,280
It  really helps somebody, right?

663
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,080
So, we're not gonna go

664
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:43,500
Again, there are some people,

665
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,000
if you're not selling,

666
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,760
if you don't do something,

667
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,350
you're doing good,

668
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,960
you're not doing something bad.

669
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,720
Perceived to be bad by some.

670
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,240
So, there is very pure mission.

671
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,720
Number two, the commitment of the company

672
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,200
to the technology and the product,

673
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,480
something that is thriving with people.

674
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:03,070
Yes, we want to create a great product.

675
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,600
What I want the guy to,

676
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:06,440
if there's something bothering them,

677
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,000
like what, how,

678
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:09,520
what can be the customer experience.

679
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,440
Definitely.

680
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,040
End of the day, I would like

681
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,520
the team members

682
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,500
to think about the company.

683
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,160
And people like that

684
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,110
that they're connecting too.

685
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,920
Right.

686
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,280
They are very transparent culture.

687
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,680
So, the team members, they know.

688
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,960
Okay, we're making numbers.

689
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,400
What's there.

690
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,520
We usually make the numbers

691
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,160
and then we usually exceed them.

692
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,760
So, it's very transparent.

693
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,200
And also it's also keeping

694
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,480
a message of success.

695
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,840
No. I think that is support.

696
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,840
Which also tells

697
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,160
about a lot of predictions.

698
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,480
So, whenever we're operating a forecast,

699
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,800
not only to ourselves,

700
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:40,480
also to our vendors.

701
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,500
And also, internally,

702
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:44,840
to sales team members,

703
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:45,640
and to product managers

704
00:24:45,641 --> 00:24:47,160
who like to be very honest

705
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,800
with the numbers.

706
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,000
And then also to  ourself,

707
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,310
and they're transparent to ourself.

708
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,360
And then if you can put together

709
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,040
a forecast, don't put it there.

710
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:57,160
Right. That I think something is that,

711
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:59,160
a lot of young entrepreneurs

712
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,880
need to uphold that and learn,

713
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,920
especially in today's age.

714
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,040
Benny, before we leave

715
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,280
20 minutes go by so fast.

716
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,240
I wanna thank you for your time

717
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,520
and your generosity.

718
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,920
We know each other from J-Ventures.

719
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,960
And it's been great working over there.

720
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,000
And we met in person

721
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,880
right before the start of Corona.

722
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,520
And I look forward

723
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,000
to seeing you again in person

724
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:18,400
in the monthly meetings after Corona.

725
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,160
But before we leave,

726
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,080
I need three words

727
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,240
that best describe you.

728
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,600
Oh.

729
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:28,040
The hardest question.

730
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,480
And you asking me to describe myself.

731
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,240
Usually, I'm gonna answer,

732
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,160
"Hey, go ask others

733
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,959
what they say about me."

734
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,280
So, you know what?

735
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,550
I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna ask,

736
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,000
If I were to ask any of your 300 employees

737
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,840
or your 1500 customers, who is Benny?

738
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,280
What are the three characteristics

739
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,200
that he is most represented as?

740
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,040
So he's a,

741
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:54,280
definitely a Builder.

742
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,070
Builder of technology and an innovator.

743
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,960
So, definitely I would say that

744
00:25:58,961 --> 00:26:01,480
I'm very much kind of innovated platform

745
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,080
that it's not like another category

746
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,000
out there in the market,

747
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,440
that is successful and working.

748
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:10,160
A career builder.

749
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,920
So, building careers and then,

750
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:17,070
and also, career builder as well.

751
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,240
I would say that it would,

752
00:26:18,241 --> 00:26:22,520
I think I can stand behind that.

753
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,110
It definitely sounds like it.

754
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,880
The third one, ouch,

755
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:28,680
I think that it's amazing

756
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,640
that you're thinking

757
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:30,360
critically about this.

758
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,520
Because a lot of people,

759
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,720
they know immediately

760
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,280
and they're saying,

761
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,480
like these interview questions.

762
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,680
But I think that you're so humble

763
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,760
and you're really, you're thinking about

764
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,800
the people that you have

765
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,600
and your building this

766
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,760
great great company.

767
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,590
And it exudes from this conversation

768
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,350
how you're putting so much focus

769
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,800
on the career building

770
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,400
and the success of your customers

771
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
and the success of others along with you.

772
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
You're not just thinking about

773
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,680
how can I make it the biggest,

774
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,760
but how can I build a culture

775
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,720
and how can I build a team

776
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,280
that is really proud of what we're doing.

777
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,640
And I think that speaks for itself.

778
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,680
So, I'm gonna be great with two words

779
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,000
with that description at the end.

780
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,280
So, I really wanna thank you

781
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,960
for this inspiration, really.

782
00:27:05,961 --> 00:27:07,360
Thank you, Michael for the opportunity

783
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,040
to speak here.

784
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,200
I appreciate your time.

785
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,160
Of course. No, thank you.

786
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,120
And I'm gonna reach back to you.

787
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,640
Of course, when I have my own venture

788
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,720
and I can't wait to work together

789
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,240
in the future.

790
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:17,070
I'm looking forward to it. Take care.

791
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,120
Bye Benny. Toda  raba.
