1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,880
You need to put

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,720
all of those attributes together

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,920
and be able to make the deal happen.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,320
So, as my boss once said,

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,120
"Look, at the end,

6
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,080
I give you a deal.

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,440
You'll make it happen at the end."

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,160
Ruby Chen, thank you so much

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,760
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,880
Good morning to me,

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,200
good evening to you.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,680
How are you?

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,920
I am doing fine.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,640
So hopefully,

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,400
you know, from the name,

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,040
you were not envisioning

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,760
some sort of Chinese lady

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,240
from Singapore.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,240
It is a bit misleading.

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,920
So, I get that a lot

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,400
when people see me

22
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,200
and expect to see a female

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,560
instead of maybe a Jewish kid

24
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,760
from New York City,

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,880
which I am actually from.

26
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,680
So, what is the story behind the Chen?

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,240
I haven't met many Jewish people

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,680
from Brooklyn with the last name Chen.

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,800
So, it depends who asks.

30
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,360
So, you know,

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,160
if it is people that are close to me,

32
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,560
so, it is actually a abbreviation

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,200
of a longer Jewish name.

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,960
But I did have the opportunity

35
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,200
when working at Amdocs,

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,880
which is a multinational company

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,240
on the M&A team,

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,320
we actually acquired a company

39
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,560
in France that the main customer

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,720
was China Mobile.

41
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,160
So, they needed to send somebody to China

42
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,040
to explain that we will continue

43
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,640
the commitments of the company

44
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,480
and everything is good.

45
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,840
So, who did they send?

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,360
They sent the Chinese guy.

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,160
Of course.

48
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,360
I was supposed to meet

49
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,240
some Chinese executives

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,280
from China Mobile

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
and when I walked in,

52
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,680
he was like looking,

53
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,400
"Wait a second,

54
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,080
where's that Chinese lady

55
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,120
that I was supposed to meet?"

56
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,320
So, I invented some family out in China.

57
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,760
It's a not that much of a known fact,

58
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,200
but during World War II, as you know,

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,960
the most of the borders were closed

60
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,840
for Jewish people

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,640
that wanted to exit Europe.

62
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,240
But actually one

63
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,600
of the countries that did have

64
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,280
their borders open was actually China.

65
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,400
So, there is actually Chinese Jewish

66
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,680
community that populated

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,880
during World War II.

68
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,280
So, I made up some Chinese family

69
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,000
and we ended up

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,600
being far distant cousins

71
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,920
and from there the deal went pretty well.

72
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,720
I think that's a phenomenal story.

73
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,200
Ruby, we have a lot of things

74
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,680
to talk about from running accelerators

75
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,160
when they weren't necessarily cool

76
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,880
all the way to doing

77
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,720
corporate venture capital,

78
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,280
which is also a little bit

79
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,440
of a new phenomena

80
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,960
that I've seen on the crazy uprising

81
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,720
in the past few years.

82
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,520
But you actually, again,

83
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,080
did that before it was cool.

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,480
So, I'm starting to see a pattern here

85
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,400
of identifying trends.

86
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,840
So, there's a lot to,

87
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,640
there's a lot for me to learn here.

88
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,280
Can you tell me

89
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,400
a little bit about your journey?

90
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,840
How do you get to being

91
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,440
a director at these fantastic companies

92
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,440
and then being on the wave

93
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,760
of these great trends?

94
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,560
Well, to the young audience here,

95
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,120
I would have like to say

96
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,560
that there was a plan

97
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,680
and a scheme behind it,

98
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,120
but it kind of happens by accident.

99
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,360
Right.

100
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,000
More often than not.

101
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,880
So, in my personal case,

102
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,960
coming from New York City

103
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,360
and being native US speaker,

104
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,440
so, being here in Israel,

105
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,240
that was kind of like

106
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,960
an unfair competitive advantage.

107
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
So, that's how I got into

108
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,600
the high tech business to begin with.

109
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,440
It started by joining a

110
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,480
semi governmental entity here in Israel

111
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,000
that provided subsidized

112
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,320
economic services to startups.

113
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,360
Meaning, lining the business plans

114
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,120
and talking about marketing plans.

115
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,120
So, you know, having that

116
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,920
native English back then

117
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,200
kind of helped me get into that domain

118
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,560
and I was working in a entity

119
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,920
that had a lot of startups

120
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,440
that we supported.

121
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,560
And there I got to know a little bit

122
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,040
of the ecosystem

123
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,960
and, you know, talking to people

124
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,040
and getting to understand that,

125
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,840
and that's how I got into my first gig,

126
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,760
which was the venture capital firm

127
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,720
in Israel called Stage One Ventures.

128
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,680
It was a $35 million fund.

129
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,600
The main LPs was Bezeq,

130
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,160
which is the Israeli quad-play

131
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,640
sort of telecommunication plan.

132
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,520
I didn't realize that they

133
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,840
have an arm into venture capitals.

134
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,400
This is so interesting.

135
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,000
Hey, dude, I'm a bit ancient,

136
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,360
so, I'm talking about 20 years ago.

137
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,480
So, you don't take everything

138
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,640
in perspective but,

139
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,760
it was something that Bezeq

140
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,720
did at the past.

141
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,240
And the idea of the fund,

142
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,080
because it was a relatively small fund,

143
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,240
was to ask itself, okay,

144
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,720
how do I maximize

145
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,240
the capital commitment that I have.

146
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,080
And at that time,

147
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Israel had and still does

148
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,880
a program of technology incubators,

149
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,360
which at the time was owned

150
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,240
and managed by the state of Israel.

151
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,120
And they came to the conclusion,

152
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,200
the state of Israel,

153
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,160
that managing an incubator

154
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,120
isn't probably one

155
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,680
of the core competencies of a state

156
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,240
and that's why

157
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,240
they wanted to privatize it.

158
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,400
Now, when are we talking about?

159
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,080
At what year?

160
00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:39,400
Probably about 2001, 2002.

161
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Wow. That's unbelievable.

162
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,623
So, we're talking about 20 years ago.

163
00:05:42,624 --> 00:05:43,320
Right.

164
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,240
Time flies when you're having fun, man.

165
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,840
And so, the idea was to

166
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,080
they use those people

167
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,600
that did not know about this program.

168
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,240
It's a pretty innovative program

169
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,680
that the state of Israel created

170
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,600
in the mid 90s

171
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,040
when there was that large influx

172
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,920
of Russian immigrants.

173
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,600
And instead of just

174
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,720
having these people do,

175
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,760
you know, low level work

176
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,480
because they did not know the language,

177
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,440
the state wanted to utilize these people

178
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,680
and be able to utilize

179
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,480
the technology capabilities

180
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,040
that they have.

181
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,560
So, they created this program

182
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,040
that basically subsidized

183
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,640
the first two years of R&D development

184
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,040
that the state of Israel takes most

185
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,240
of the risk associated with that.

186
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,640
So, as a private investor you put in

187
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,500
one dollar and the state gives you

188
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:31,800
four dollars back

189
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,280
up to a budget of about $600,000.

190
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,901
Which is good for about

191
00:06:36,902 --> 00:06:38,240
a year and a half.

192
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,840
So, what the evolution

193
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,760
of the program was,

194
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,400
is that you have

195
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,320
this large influx of Russians,

196
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,280
but it was also open

197
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,680
to other types of entrepreneurs as well,

198
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,800
not only Russian immigrants.

199
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,760
But as I described previously,

200
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,480
the state after

201
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,640
a couple of years understood

202
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,520
it would be better to move

203
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,840
into private hands.

204
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,480
Now, why is that?

205
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,160
Tell me a little bit

206
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,240
about this transition?

207
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,840
Because it's a really interesting

208
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,240
piece of the history, you know.

209
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,200
Today, there must be,

210
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,120
dozens, if not hundreds of incubators

211
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,640
and accelerators just in Israel.

212
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:11,840
Right?

213
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,520
And just in Tel Aviv,

214
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,320
not even counting those in Jerusalem

215
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,040
and the different areas,

216
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,760
what was that process like

217
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,520
for the Israeli state,

218
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,160
the government, to run

219
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,440
one of the first incubators

220
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,760
to start that trend

221
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,000
and then make that rational decision

222
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,920
of moving it to private hands?

223
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,760
Yeah. So, I think the state of Israel

224
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,480
was able to identify pretty amazingly,

225
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,360
a market inefficiency.

226
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,480
And throughout the years of the program,

227
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,160
even today, the way that

228
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,160
the chief innovation officer

229
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,000
of the state of Israel looks at it

230
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,280
is to identify

231
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,720
those market inefficiencies

232
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,720
that evolve over the years.

233
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,280
So, at the beginning saying, okay,

234
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,560
look, this early stage of investments,

235
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,480
there's a gap here.

236
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,560
So, there are VCs that do investments

237
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,680
but they do not want

238
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,000
to take that high level of risk.

239
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,760
So, how do I identify or create

240
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,480
such a program that can

241
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,440
deal with that inefficiency.

242
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,960
And over the years, it has changed.

243
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,200
So, many years ago,

244
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,640
the state of Israel identified

245
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,080
that biotech, is has been on the sub.

246
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,440
So, they created a program specifically

247
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,040
for biotech companies.

248
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,680
And being always on top of things,

249
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,320
trying to understand them,

250
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,560
over the years as being the CEO

251
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,360
of a technology incubator,

252
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,160
also in the city of Tel Aviv,

253
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,080
compared to maybe

254
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,160
an incubator in the north of Israel

255
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,160
or the south,

256
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,560
you can guess I was on speed dial

257
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,360
of many of the different delegations

258
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,840
that were visiting here in Israel

259
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,480
that try to understand

260
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,680
and duplicate this program.

261
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,560
And actually, we had the opportunity

262
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,520
and many times actually

263
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,560
to visit different countries,

264
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,600
Europe, Asia,

265
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,120
anything in between saying, look,

266
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,560
we want to try to duplicate

267
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,760
this for our ecosystem.

268
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,680
But the question is,

269
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,600
which is the long conversation

270
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,440
that we don't have time

271
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,160
to go into today,

272
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,160
is what is the special ingredients

273
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,040
that enabled the Israeli ecosystem

274
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,360
to flourish and to be what it is today,

275
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,880
the startup nation?

276
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,320
So, that's a long conversation.

277
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,920
But you know, anyone that wants

278
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,960
to hear more about that,

279
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,240
we can go into that into detail, so.

280
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,040
The technology incubator thing

281
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,680
at the beginning,

282
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,640
we were able to utilize Bezeq

283
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,760
and play with the Bezeq Labs,

284
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,400
which means, you know,

285
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,520
telecommunications, cybersecurity,

286
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,240
before that was cool,

287
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,120
as well as different types of technologies.

288
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,000
Again, we're talking about 20 years ago.

289
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,240
Right?

290
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:45,960
Unbelievable.

291
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
15 to 18 years ago, yeah.

292
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,040
So, the best things

293
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,960
that we had actually

294
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,320
was a company we put in $600,000,

295
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,720
a company in the telecommunication

296
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,920
authentication space

297
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,120
that was called Traffix Systems

298
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,880
that was acquired by F5

299
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,000
for $130 million a few years after.

300
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,800
So, you do the math yourself

301
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
you understand, you know, from the

302
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,320
$30 million dollar fund

303
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,120
that sounds like a nice return

304
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,920
on an investment.

305
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,600
100%.

306
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,120
So, I did that for about four years.

307
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,000
And then being able to

308
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,200
have experience of playing

309
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,400
or being into action

310
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,000
with a large corporate like Bezeq

311
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,880
to identify new investments

312
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,760
and utilize that, I was recruited by a

313
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,200
New York Stock Exchange,

314
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,263
traded Israeli company

315
00:10:36,264 --> 00:10:39,128
called Amdocs, A-M-D-O-C-S,

316
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:42,440
which is a pretty big company

317
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,840
in Israeli standards.

318
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,480
Its market cap is about

319
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,920
$12 billion today.

320
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,160
They sell about five billion annually.

321
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,720
So, what they do

322
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,120
is they provide software solutions

323
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,320
for telecommunication

324
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,840
and media companies.

325
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,000
So, think about the billing

326
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,600
of your mobile phone

327
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
from AT&T at the end of the month,

328
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,080
that is being generated

329
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,800
from a Amdocs billing system.

330
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,000
When you call into a call center

331
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
of a Verizon,

332
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,200
that also the back end,

333
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,760
the software is a Amdocs system

334
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,560
more often than not.

335
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,520
And if you think about

336
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
the network itself,

337
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,720
you know, the 3G,4G, 5G,

338
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,640
all that software

339
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,320
that manages the different networks

340
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,480
is also managed by an Amdocs system.

341
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,640
So, Amdocs at the time

342
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,360
also had a open innovation program.

343
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,320
And this is again talking 2007, 2008

344
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,440
and they had a small team

345
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,320
that was supposed to interact

346
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,960
with the Israeli ecosystem

347
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,200
and one program was to take

348
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,640
a startup technology,

349
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,440
combine it with a Amdocs solution,

350
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,480
create a new offering

351
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,040
and then sell it to an AT&T,

352
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,400
or to Verizon or T-Mobile.

353
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,840
They had another small team

354
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,000
that also had the action item

355
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,200
of when having delegations

356
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,000
such as AT&T

357
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,960
or Vodafone visit as to match

358
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,760
between the Israelis startups to

359
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,880
the requirements

360
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,840
of the telecommunications company,

361
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,960
working very closely

362
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,240
with the sales teams

363
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,320
of the Amdocs to be able

364
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,920
to identify missing gaps

365
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,560
and to understand

366
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,320
what the requirements are.

367
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,240
So, they were missing

368
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,240
that small program

369
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,920
to get some skin in the game.

370
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,880
So, saying, look,

371
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,400
if we're helping these startups

372
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,600
develop these new technologies,

373
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,160
products based on requirements

374
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,480
and also selling it to them,

375
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,960
why not also the venture program.

376
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,640
Right.

377
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,520
That makes perfect sense.

378
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,560
That is what's called the CVC,

379
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,240
which is a Corporate

380
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,960
Venture Capital program.

381
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,800
So, I was given the task,

382
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,040
okay, go figure it out

383
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,760
and go create something.

384
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,040
So today, when you think about CVCs,

385
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,000
there are hundreds,

386
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,960
if not thousands of programs like that

387
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,520
within the Fortune 1000,

388
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,280
I think maybe 80% of them

389
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,080
have some sort of program like that.

390
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,480
But go back about 12 years ago,

391
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,760
not that common.

392
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,440
So, at the time,

393
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,480
there wasn't too many people to

394
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,320
study and to try to duplicate

395
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,800
what can be done.

396
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,480
So in Israel, we had Cisco,

397
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,880
which had a venture program.

398
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,640
We had Motorola,

399
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,600
which also one of the first ones.

400
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,360
IBM, which have been here also

401
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,520
for many years.

402
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,440
But there weren't too many.

403
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,520
So, how do you put together

404
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,120
a investment charter.

405
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,800
Meaning, okay, how do you invest

406
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,320
and what do you invest,

407
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,760
who's the investment committee.

408
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,000
Right.

409
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,120
So, typically you need

410
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,920
to have a CFO

411
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,440
because she signs the check

412
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,080
at the end of the day.

413
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,000
But you have someone from product,

414
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,800
you have somebody from sales,

415
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,400
do you create the fund

416
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,400
with a dedicated capital

417
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,000
that is dedicated to investments,

418
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,840
or does it come out

419
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,120
of the balance sheet,

420
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,720
so, all of these questions, you know,

421
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,160
were kind of open

422
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,840
with me given the task

423
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,560
to go figure it out

424
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,040
and come up with something.

425
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,360
I would like to share one antidot,

426
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,600
of that process.

427
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,040
The CEO of Amdocs at the time,

428
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,080
his name was Dov Baharav,

429
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,960
he of course, I wanted him

430
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,840
on the investment committee.

431
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,760
You always want the CEO

432
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,720
on the investment committee.

433
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,280
But actually, he said something

434
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,760
that had a lot of sense.

435
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,720
And you know, over the years,

436
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,000
i even believe it even more

437
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,480
in what he had to say, he said,

438
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:40,360
"Look, if I'm on the investment committee,

439
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,120
everybody else will wait

440
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,480
to listen what I have to say,

441
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,200
and then make their decision.

442
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,400
It would be better

443
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,800
for you not to have me

444
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,440
on the investment committee

445
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,720
and then you could have

446
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,760
that open discussion

447
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,560
that you're looking for,

448
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,280
refine those hidden gems

449
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,480
that might not come on

450
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,720
to all later

451
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,560
because it's not currently

452
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,360
in high priority."

453
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,040
But the intention of the program

454
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,800
was indeed to find

455
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,280
those types of companies

456
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,680
that are up and coming

457
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,520
that maybe at a corporate culture

458
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,200
you might miss.

459
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,080
So, I started doing that.

460
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,560
I made a lot of investments

461
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,840
in the mobility space.

462
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,160
The more famous ones is

463
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,920
in the mobile advertising space,

464
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,720
a company called  Amobee,

465
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,640
which was acquired by SingTel

466
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,640
for $340 million.

467
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,280
We invested in another company in Israel,

468
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,560
Trivnet mobile payment,

469
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,880
again, I'm talking about 2008, 2009,

470
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,640
which was sold to Gemalto

471
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,280
the same manufacturer.

472
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,160
We also had a company called Pontis

473
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,920
that actually justified

474
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,960
the model of the CVC,

475
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,600
meaning you invest in a company sometimes

476
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,080
because you're not prepared

477
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,480
to do the M&A yet.

478
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,520
So, you say, you know what,

479
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,160
let me put some cash in.

480
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,520
I get some ability

481
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,840
to influence the company.

482
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,240
And also, if there is an acquisition

483
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,120
on the table

484
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,840
then I am able to manage that

485
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,440
maybe more quickly

486
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,120
and be able to act on that.

487
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,920
So, this company called Pontis,

488
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,440
which we invested in 2008,

489
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,160
was eventually acquired by Amdocs,

490
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,320
which kind of justifies the model

491
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,806
of why to do a series [--].

492
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:21,240
So, what it sounds to me is that

493
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,600
the difference with CVC is that,

494
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
CVC, it is very similar to venture capital

495
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,960
in the sense that you're, you know,

496
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,760
you're buying equity

497
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
into another business,

498
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,160
say, for various incentives,

499
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,960
but you're introducing

500
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,040
another layer of complexity

501
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,720
both because of the different interests

502
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,520
that could arise.

503
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,560
So, when a regular VC invests,

504
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,920
it's primarily for the financial returns.

505
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,040
But when you're introducing

506
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,760
a corporate venture capital fund,

507
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,720
there's all sorts of incentives.

508
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,880
One of those, for example,

509
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
is to be able to influence

510
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,840
the decision making of a company

511
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,800
which could potentially

512
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,200
at some point merge into yours

513
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,920
and you want to be able

514
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,440
to either influence their technology,

515
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,400
their roadmap,

516
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,520
their financials, their other customers.

517
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,080
So, it sounds like

518
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,240
it's very complicated.

519
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,440
And I think it's really inspiring

520
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,040
that you got to be there

521
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,120
and be really a pioneer.

522
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,480
From what it sounds like,

523
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
in a world where today

524
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,200
like you're mentioning,

525
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,280
almost every Fortune 1000 company

526
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,600
has a venture capital arm.

527
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,640
Yeah. And it has evolved over the years.

528
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,000
And this also could be

529
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,169
a 101 session of a CVC.

530
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,960
So, over the years

531
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,800
they have been developed

532
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,840
different flavors of types of CVCs.

533
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,400
So, just going flash forward with myself,

534
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,640
moving from Amdocs

535
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,720
to another corporate called, Nice,

536
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,120
which is traded on the Nasdaq,

537
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,360
also market cap is about

538
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,680
12 billion today.

539
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,400
It's a enterprise software company

540
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,800
that captures [--] data sets,

541
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,760
normalizes them and finds insights.

542
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,640
So, it's a data analytics company

543
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,720
where the main data source

544
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,880
that they started was voice.

545
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,080
So, again, think about large B2C

546
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,520
organizations, banks,

547
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,360
Telcos, media companies,

548
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,040
so, when you call

549
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,240
into one of those entities,

550
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,520
you have that annoying message

551
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,840
at the beginning that says

552
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,760
this call is now being recorded

553
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,000
for compliance.

554
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,040
So, eight out of 10 times

555
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,920
in North America,

556
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
that would be a Nice system.

557
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,200
And by capturing that actual data

558
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,960
and being able to do speech to text

559
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,920
text analytics, emotion detection,

560
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,400
next best action

561
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,760
for the call agent itself,

562
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,880
there's a lot of value

563
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,680
that is hidden in that.

564
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,520
So, at that entity as well,

565
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,320
I was at the club dev team

566
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,320
doing ventures and M&As.

567
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,480
And the last two years,

568
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,960
I actually established

569
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,360
and led the Hyundai,

570
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,440
a motor company venture,

571
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,680
activities here in Tel Aviv.

572
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,320
So, I've been doing CVCs for 12 years.

573
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,040
So, there's a lot to be said

574
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,000
and to be discussed about

575
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,240
if you are a young guy

576
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,040
that wants to get into that space,

577
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,840
I could be glad you know,

578
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,480
give me a call, to look me up.

579
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,320
I'll be glad to share

580
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,360
some of the insights,

581
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,800
and some of the things I've gone through.

582
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,720
Wonderful. Ruby,

583
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,720
it sounds like there's more hours

584
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,840
and more of content

585
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,760
that we could talk about

586
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,640
that would be fascinating,

587
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,960
whether it's the Israeli ecosystem

588
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,800
and watching it from the roots of it,

589
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,920
you know, 20 years ago

590
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,240
with Bezeq, and then moving on

591
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,840
to CVCs and seeing where that trend

592
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,840
is going today,

593
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,000
to talking about mobility

594
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,960
and enterprise software,

595
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,920
there's endless more

596
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,640
that we could discuss.

597
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,800
But unfortunately,

598
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,200
we do have only 20 minutes.

599
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,920
So, I have to ask you

600
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,200
the last and most important question,

601
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,680
which is three words

602
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,360
that you would use

603
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,280
to describe yourself.

604
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,560
Yeah, that's a nice question to ask.

605
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,320
I would start with curious.,

606
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,160
So starting from telecom

607
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,360
and then doing enterprise software

608
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,240
and then auto tech.

609
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,640
So, I guess I'm just waiting for

610
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,480
that corporate that's

611
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
in the biotech space.

612
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,560
So, I could feel that I've

613
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,600
you know, checked all the boxes.

614
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,360
A deal maker.

615
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:04,680
Yeah.

616
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,600
So, one of my previous boss said

617
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,040
and this is again,

618
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,520
maybe something to the younger audience,

619
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:12,240
"How do you become

620
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,480
the best deal maker?"

621
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,880
So, as my boss once said to me

622
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,440
in a larger audience,

623
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,840
"It's not because I'm the guy

624
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,040
that knows how to build

625
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,440
the best excel

626
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,240
for the financial model.

627
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
That's not being

628
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,520
the best technology guy

629
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,520
that knows how to understand

630
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,360
and understand the technology benefit.

631
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,960
It's not the HR side

632
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,160
which is also highly appreciated

633
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,600
at the end."

634
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,800
Because it's a people thing

635
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,680
if you acquire a company,

636
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,040
you invest in a company,

637
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,400
so, people business.

638
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:42,720
Right.

639
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,440
But you need to put

640
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,320
all of those attributes together

641
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,480
and be able to make the deal happen.

642
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,920
So, as my boss once said,

643
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,720
"Look, at the end,

644
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,640
I give you a deal.

645
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,160
You'll make it happen at the end."

646
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,778
And I think, you know,

647
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:57,000
that's a very nice compliment I have

648
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,800
and also for those young people

649
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,320
to think about that as well.

650
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,280
So, last but not least,

651
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,720
I think connected.

652
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:08,400
So, being part of this ecosystem,

653
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,320
not only the Israeli ecosystem,

654
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,600
but the corporate venture capital

655
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,360
ecosystem for the last 20 years,

656
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,400
you get to know people

657
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,480
and at the end,

658
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,560
you know, you have that

659
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,240
ability to be familiar with people

660
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,840
over the years.

661
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,080
And then when you do come to them

662
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,480
and come with ideas

663
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,160
and want to collaborate, you know,

664
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,000
based on the reputation

665
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,200
that you're able to build for yourself

666
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,960
over the years,

667
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,640
that is something that's very hard

668
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,240
to establish

669
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,000
and it's like easy to lose.

670
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,560
So, you need to be very

671
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,920
diligent on those types of approaches

672
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,160
and who do you approach and when.

673
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,480
So, being that connector,

674
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,080
I think also something

675
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,400
that is highly important

676
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,200
to think about as well.

677
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,840
And now we have

678
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,400
the Dubai ecosystem as well

679
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,680
that Michael, you just came back

680
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,760
from that you could say

681
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,000
a word or two about building bridges

682
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,840
and being a guy

683
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,240
that could connect between the dots

684
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,880
is something that

685
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,440
is a skill set that I think

686
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,000
Israelis acquired today.

687
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,120
And I think that one of the,

688
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,440
one of the most, like you mentioned,

689
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,240
I just literally 12 hours ago

690
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,760
I got back from Dubai.

691
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,000
This will be shared

692
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,800
with our audience in a few weeks.

693
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,400
But just got off the flight recently.

694
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,440
And I think one of the things

695
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,400
that fascinated me most

696
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,720
was understanding cultural differences

697
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,880
and really opening ourselves up

698
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,800
to a whole new world

699
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,920
where business is important.

700
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,363
But connections,

701
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:32,480
and human to human connections

702
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,560
and trust is at the forefront

703
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,160
of these business endeavors.

704
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,600
And I think that is something

705
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,280
that I was very inspired by this week.

706
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,160
I got so used to the

707
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,520
Western way of doing business

708
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,400
and talking to each other

709
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,320
and forming relationships.

710
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,320
It's very different over there.

711
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,080
And I'm just starting to learn

712
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,480
how to do it.

713
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,760
And I can't,

714
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,640
and I'm 100% sure that

715
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,320
Dubai and that part of the world

716
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,200
is going to be a major part

717
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,840
of my professional life

718
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,400
and probably that of many people

719
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,680
in Israel and the US.

720
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,160
So, I think that we need to start

721
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,440
from the culture.

722
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,720
But I definitely take to heart

723
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,680
what the answers from this talk.

724
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,080
And Ruby, I really want to thank you

725
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,960
for being so generous with your time.

726
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,480
It was really, really wonderful.

727
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,440
Thank you for the inspiration.

728
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,240
And I have a feeling

729
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,640
we're going to have

730
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,120
to do a few more episodes

731
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,400
to really capture some of those

732
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:17,920
other insights

733
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,760
that you were talking about.

734
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,200
Yeah, will be glad to share my insights

735
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,320
so many of the young guys

736
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,280
out there are listening

737
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,880
all ladies, please,

738
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,600
feel free to reach out.

739
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,280
Will be glad to share.

740
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,000
Wonderful.

741
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,951
Thank you very much, Ruby.

742
00:23:33,952 --> 00:23:34,320
Take care.
