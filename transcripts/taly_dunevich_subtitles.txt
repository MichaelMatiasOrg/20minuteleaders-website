Okay. Taly Dunevich, thank you so much for joining me in 20 Minute Leaders. Thank you for having me. So so fun to have you. You know, just before we started the call, I discovered that you were a world champion and bronze medalist in wind surfing. That's true. It was when I was very very young. I'm not actually practicing that anymore, but yeah. And you were the Israeli national champion for quite some time as well. Yes. Yes. Unbelievable. So, first of all, let's start with that. Tell me, what is it like being a national champion of a sport? And actually Israel, with the beach and the waves, I mean, there's a lot of people surf. So, it's not just like a random sport that you picked up. It's pretty popular. And then what is it like going to the world championship and actually getting a medal? That's an amazing feeling to get a medal and to compete against world champions. It was a great experience as I was a girl back then. I was in high school and then the army. This is the times when I was actually doing that and just being among the team the Israeli team, which was I was the only woman. Still the only women in everything I'm currently doing in many areas in my life. But back then I was the only woman in the Israeli game. And when we went to competitions around the world, I was kind of sleeping with guys in the room. They were taking showers. They didn't even notice I was actually a woman. They kind of missed that. So, I was really part of, it was very unique time. And I actually think it really helps me today because today I always find myself also the only woman in the room in most business environments, I mean, IT kind of. So, I feel very comfortable because I grew up this way. So, I'm already very very comfortable being with a room or an ocean or a sea or monitor improvements. So, it was fine. Unbelievable. So, yeah. So, you're not just an executive in a tech company, but you're actually an executive in a deep technology tech company. Ayehu Software and technologies. I mean, it's leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to do some really fantastic things. And being an executive there and vice president of Strategic Partnerships and Alliances. I mean, you're talking about really understanding the technology, but also understanding the other people and the other in other companies. And I guess in a similar industry, which still today is still unfortunately dominated by male counterparts, right? Yeah. And is that changing? Or is that the norm? What do you see happening now in this domain? I see a change. I see more women. Not enough in leadership positions. I see the more kind of coming of as developers and program managers. You see more and more of them. Yeah. And I'm inviting more women and girls and join. Of course. By the way, Taly, I have to tell you because I got so excited today. This is not relevant to our conversation. But I discovered coconut water in the US today. I never had it in my life in Israel. And I'm obsessed with it. So, these interviews, I'm only drinking coconut water. It's really really good coconut water. It has actually a lot of electrolytes and everything that you need for your bodies, your workout and everything. It's really, really good. When I went to Burning Man, this is the one thing I really packed. My entire RV was full with coconut water because I was told that this is a good thing to have in Burning Man when you kind of you're not really taking care of your nutrition. Wonderful. Wonderful. Okay. So, right before we started, you're an expert on building alliances and relationships. And what I mentioned was that I like talking about the things that the guest or the leader is passionate about. And you immediately said, I'm not passionate about alliances. I'm passionate about people. Tell me what that means to you. So, alliance is just a piece of paper where you write who is doing what, right? So, I'm not passionate about papers and words too much. I'm more passionate about, I'm very privileged to be doing day in and day out what I love doing. And I meet people. And I meet people from different cultures and different backgrounds. I worked a lot with India, which is huge. And I just love it. And people in Europe and Nordics and Israel and North America. So, I work with all cultures. I just love the platform, or the agenda is a business agenda. But just meeting people. Meeting and understanding where they come from. What drives them. What beliefs they come from. This is what I'm really, I'm very very fascinated about human beings in general. So, my work allows me to explore more my area of passion, which is people. And through that, when you're really interested, when you're really curious in people in where they're looking for and what they wanna get. I think it's a great way to really accomplish what you're also want to do for business. Like to get the results, to get the bottom line, to get revenues, because you can really build, I really care. I really, very fast, I built relationship trust with people because I really care and I really love, I love them. I don't know, there is no other ways to say that. It may sound corny, but I really love people. It's incredible and actually right. As we're having this discussion, we're talking about an internship program for the fund that we're both involved with, J-Ventures. And going through the details and seeing how passionate you are in helping the future generation and how they are going to be integrated within and learn from the fund and the things that we're doing. I think that speaks exactly to what you're describing here. And I wanna take you back a few years. Talk to me a little bit about how you form these relationships in the business setting. So, these are not just friends. They're business friends that you're forming alliances and relationships. My imagination and tell me if I'm wrong, is that, two years ago or three years ago, you wanna form a business relationship. You hop on a plane, you go over there, you visit the offices, you go out to dinner, you go out to a Broadway show, and you talk and you slowly build that trust. Is that fairly accurate? I never took anyone to a Broadway show, I have to say. But that's the whole point. That's why you do it. No. You don't have, I know that, it's difficult to say. It tells people you will dine and wine you and all these stuff. I do that to some extent, but not really. It's really like, even through Zoom. You don't need to take them to fancy places or anything. Just really speaking to people and understanding where they come from. Finding the common ground. You always have something in common with another person. Right. Really fast. If you're curious enough, go find what it is and you can build from there. And then you have the initial connection. And once you have that, you'll learn more about each other. And we're all just humans. Even if we come from different backgrounds. There is so much in common. There is more in common than not in common. And just you take down to barriers and then you can, when you have trust and you have connection, you can build everything with it. Anything with it. So, just human connection. I don't know. No, no. I mean, it sounds great. But now, I wanna take us to 2020. Yeah. The great 2020, that everybody likes to say. Yeah. And we're in the middle of the year now. We're a little bit more than the middle. And how do you build relationships? I joined a company, a wonderful wonderful company, Hippo Insurance. I did my entire on-boarding remotely. I didn't meet, I met one person from my team in person. The rest are only through video. How can I, or how should I build a meaningful relationship with my colleagues over remote? Is it different? Is it easier or harder? So, this is not the only form of communication. Yes. So, we use a lot of Zoom and you go onto video calls. I think it's a great medium to connect deeply with people. But we see it like we really look at each other when the camera is on and not off. And people really look at each other in the eyes. I think it's very very close. I don't see a lot of difference. Sometimes it's even an advantage. When in a room of people, sometimes, some people are not really related to the call or to the meeting and, I see disadvantage and advantages to this medium. I don't find it harder to do business over Zoom than I've done meeting face to face. And is that also true for meeting new people or forming new relationships? Yes. Because I understand the transition from existing relationships, continuing them. But is that the same case also for finding new partners and getting to that same level of intimacy? Because you're missing a lot of your senses, right? You're missing smell, touch. You're basically only going base to sound. I think it's a good thing to miss the smell part. Well, I would assume that when you go and build a business relationship, then you make an effort to smell. No. So, it's interesting because this is really counter-intuitive to everything that I thought of what's happening today. First of all, I have a lot of new relationships that I'm forming in the past four months when I'm working from home now and I'm not traveling anywhere. So, I've been I've been forming. And in the process of forming new relationship with new companies, with new minute service providers, its largest size. And it's going really well. I'm actually more efficient because I'm sitting here all day meeting after meeting. I can do more in the same amount of time. I don't need to travel around anywhere. And I can be very very focused on what I'm doing. And I have all my things here and my notes. Like I'm very very organized. And I'm way more efficient. So, I'm doing so much more activities per day because I'm not traveling and I don't have even the office distractions. And I don't need to be nice to anyone around me and have coffee with them during the day. I can just really focus on work which I love doing. And I can do more. And I can have one on ones. And when I started relationship with somebody, I'm also connecting with them via WhatsApp. And starting other forms. And then we're imagining the time, the day that we will actually be able to, or I'm going to have dinner with them or something. So, hopefully that will come soon. I think it's fascinating how it impacts so many different facets of our work. And I definitely see the upside and the downside of having this new norm. Tell me a little bit about what does it mean alliance building in terms of corporate? So, you're part of a big organization that has IT services. Why are alliances important and what are alliance is actually in the tech world? So, it's really important. Specifically in my company, the alliance as far represent over 60% of our revenues. So, I'm responsible in my own company for over 60%. And this is why it's so important, it really drives a lot of business and it's way more efficient. So, in our company, we have direct team that is selling directly to the enterprise and we have the partners team, which is my team, and we're selling through partners. So, and this part with less people, we sell much more. So, it's more efficient. It's like opening the doors to a more strategic long term relationship versus just selling to one enterprise, then to another enterprise. When I form relationship with our partners, for example, the global GSIs of the world like Accenture, Deloitte, Cognizant, Capgemini, just to name a few of the partners that I'm working with. So, when I formed this trusted relationship and we build the right go to market plan together, that opens the door for my company to get to 40 of their accounts. So, in forming one large alliances, we can actually sell 40 licenses versus one by one. So, this is the opportunity. And this is why it's very important. And I really believe that today in SAS companies, any company that is selling software today, partnership I think it's already as it should be. It will be a more integral and big part of their business, because today it's all about the ecosystem. The ecosystem you build around you. It's like the ISPs, the GSIs, all the different partners that you're strategically engaging with. And it's a win-win. It helps them, helps us. It's all about working together and having synergetic type of results out of that for both sides. It has to work for everyone. And that makes a lot of sense. And then do the relationships usually occur between key people in both organizations? Or is it organization to organization? In other words, you're building a relationship now with another organization, let's say Deloitte, and then you're building it with key people there that are agreeing to this. Let's say tomorrow they're advancing to their next adventure, how difficult is it to make that transition of alliance to another person? Because you have to, all of a sudden build trust and relationship with another person who has to decide whether to renew this relationship, to renew this partnership, right? So, when I'm building the relationship, so first, yes, we're building it with key people. Key people and key people. So, this is top down relationship. But I'm also, even during the sale cycle, I'm taking care of the bottom up as well. So, making sure that their people are getting certified and trained. Right. Okay. Making sure I create demands on the different pockets on the business level. But kind of one layer, two layers below that are actually taking care of their account. So, making sure they understand the value and what it brings to their clients. Making sure that they really are building the incentives for them to work with us. So, when you build it with the top key people and with the business level, which is the medium unit director level, that really manage accounts. And you build it also with the developers and operators, and delivery people and service people. On more the technical level enablement type of thing. So, you build anything, all the levels in the right way with a very defined go to market plan and KPIs. Everybody are aligned around KPI. And you just manage this entire process. Then it's really, you're getting very very sticky. It's really hard to leave you. It's actually no reason to leave you. You also have their personal relationship. They will not just ditch you for some reason. You can identify if you have an issue with anything. And if there is any competition that is threatening you and addressed it before. Of course. And when I want to, when I have an ambition to be a software engineer at a company, I go and I study computer science. I go online and I teach myself how to code in Python or Java or JavaScript. When you want to be in alliances and partnerships, I don't believe there's a major for that. I don't believe there is an online text book. Maybe there are some self-help books on Amazon. But it sounds like it's a lot of practice on the job and on the field. How do you prepare for a position like that? How do even set yourself up to go and become a VP of that at a company? That's an awesome question. I think the greatest university for the work that I do called "life", so,  if you're really, and for me specifically, this is really an area that I love. I study like for my own fun on the side. I study brain science and consciousness and spirituality. And I have so much interest in human beings and how we use this box here in the top of our body called "brain". And how we can really maximize it and understand our beliefs and how it drives us. So, specifically for me, I'm so interested in this area, called "people", and how everything works in the universe altogether. That, this is I think, for me is  the best school. Because everything, all the books that I'm reading, the podcast that I'm listening to, or around those areas and I'm just, Of course. That really helps me in work, I have to say. But Taly, you're already a vice president at a huge company. How do you get to be a vice president of partnerships and alliances at a huge company? Because you need that break to be able to go and learn through life. Is it easy to get this break? Do you join, like where do you start in order to get to that level? It's the opposite of taking break of life to learn something. It's the opposite. It's the more you're engaging in life and the more you're busy. So, I'm involve in many many things. I'm involve in J-Ventures, right? And now I'm helping putting together the internship programs. And through everything I do, And I'm involved in high powered women. And I'm involved in so many organizations. The more I involve, the more I have connections, I have an amazing rolodex. I know a lot of people. I have a great network. So, that's access to just about everything. So, anywhere I want to get to, to get to know this person, I can always get connected by somebody. People will always help me. My door is always open to helping others. And I'm always, my mission in life is to really help others grow in whatever they do. So, I think the more you are, you don't need to take a break to learn that. Actually the other way around. Be engaged. Stick with people, network. Be fully in, in the game of life, and that really helps those type of positions like business development and alliances. And then, how knowledgeable do you have to be on the tech side of things to really understand? Because at the end, you're selling a product. You're not actually selling. You're finding ways to collaborate. But at the end you have to understand, That's okay. I'm selling. I'm not hiding from it. No, no. Do you consider it selling? I am. Because when I think of alliances or partnerships, I think of a win-win situation for both parties. Well, it's true. But I've been compensated for bottom lines for revenues that I actually bring to the companies. So, it's very very measurable. What I'm bringing  it's on my paycheck. I can actually see how it's going. I'm measured. So, that's very much sells. That's very much in line. So, how do you have people get to that, the tech side? So, I'm not a techie. I'm not an engineer. I'm just learning everything I feel when I have a gap by just asking or learning or going on YouTube and reading and understanding. And I always have like, not always, but when at some point in the processes, I am bringing more an engineer to actually join me through those calls and insert a deep technical questions. But on the high level, I'm good enough to convey the benefits the business outcomes. And to even run through a demo and be a bit technical to a degree, not all the way. So, it sounds like what you're saying is that your strengths or your're ability to really, to look at others, understand their needs. Understand both technology but also business see, what does Ayehu software technologies provide and then finding that sweet spot of collaboration where you can you can provide the services to them. And then along the process later on, you can provide that engineering input, which can do a much deeper dive. Which is not necessary when you're at first in the high level of what is this partnership that we're gonna do. Perfect. You answered it. Okay. Wonderful. Taly, what should I take away from this as a young entrepreneur as I go on my next venture, what do I need to know in terms of partnerships, alliances, maybe even just selling products to others? I was in general, I always like, my first rule, even for myself, is follow your heart. So, follow your heart. I'm trying to follow mine and trying to understand what it tells me. At times when it's not very clear, this is the first life advice. I think you'll be a great candidate for any business development position because you're such a people person. Thank you. Already. And you have no problem in just interacting with just about anybody in any level at any. So, you have everything you need. You just need the content to discuss about. Which is like for me, it's Ayehu today. Tomorrow, I don't know. Or yesterday it was something else. But it's the same thing. So, you already have everything you need You're perfect. If you're looking for something, let me know. Wonderful. Thank you. Thank you very much, Taly. Before we leave, I have to ask you the most important question. My favorite question. Three words that you would use to describe yourself or that any of your clients would use to describe Taly. So, I think the first thing that comes to mind is what I said throughout the session. I'm a people person, so, really loving people. And just I'm really grateful to be able to do that everyday, for many hours every day. A second thing. What can it be? Oh, so, I am a constant learner. I always learn new things and growth and learning. I study quantum physics, and consciousness and brain science. And I just love learning new things not even related to my work. Everything becomes related at the end, by the way. Everything is getting connected. But you just, I always, like I run every day. I always listen to audiobooks or podcast or something. Even when I take a shower, I'm just having something. So, I always learn something. What's your favorite audiobook that you read recently? Hit Refresh by Satya Nadella, which is kind of a biography which was really good. And he was referencing to growth mindset, by the way, speaking about growth. He was referencing some Stanford professor who wrote the book "Mindset". And he really changed the entire culture in Microsoft around this approach. I don't know if you agree with that. So, this were two great books that I've read recently. [--] power of now, lead your life to spirituality. Definitely. And I need the third word. So, I have people person. I have constant learner. Third, I would say I'm driven. So, I'm involved in so many things. I just drive things. And my husband calls me "my engine". I'm his engine. I just let everything that I love, if it's work, driving business, driving sales, helping Jay Ventures in the fund or anything else I'm involve. Just driving things forward. I'm very task oriented to the degree that I'm not trying to relax a little bit. So, yeah. So, I would say those are the main three things. Tally, toda raba. Thank you very very much. And stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you. Bye bye.
