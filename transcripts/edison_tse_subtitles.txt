1 Professor Edison Tse, nice to have you here on 20 Minute Leaders. Thank you. Yeah. Nice to talk to you here. Thank you. So, I've had the unique pleasure of being in your class most recently at Stanford. The masters in Management and Engineering. MS&E 274. And you're a world expert. On your product management. Thinking strategically about entrepreneurial strategy. The inventor of the grabber-holder dynamics strategy. And I'd love to spend these next 20 minutes in sort of peeking your brain. And trying to consolidate some of what we've learned over the past 10 weeks. It's gonna be an impossible feat. But we'll try as much as we can. So, can you just start telling me a little bit about yourself. How did you even get to this incredible incredible industry? Okay. Well, I'm starting a little bit about myself. I'm actually a, my training is electric engineering. So, I got a PhD in Electric Engineering from MIT. So, my area's actually in System and Control. And I've been a doing a lot of work in the area. Getting some awards and things like that. But, I'm sort of start interested in something. I wanna do the system in control. They are all man-made. Right? System things like that. Well, I started in the system where you have a lot of human. A lot of people. Right? So, I start to work in the industry for many years. And then I start coming back to Stanford. But going actually not to Electric Engineering Department. But going into beginning is the Engineering Economic Systems. Where we are looking at systems that are can be human system, can be you know, it’s a combination of human system and the engineering system. So, it can be that it's an interaction of all the system that make me do it. And I'm also interested in some of the economics as part of it. So that’s how I get started. Then to some work, for example managing fisheries. And some of the natural resources. And things like that. Well, I got also interested in business because I got my ex-boss asked me to join his company. We started a company but I was faculty member. So I say, "I can’t join the company." Where were you already a faculty member? At Stanford? Yeah. I was a faculty at Stanford. And so, I said, "I would not be able to join the company." But he said, "Well you don’t have to join the company. Well you can be a consultant. Right?" And so, to be a consultant. To be a co-founder. As a consultant. And I say, "What? That's interesting. Go" So, I get into it. So, we build a company. Which is in the very beginning, it's actually Org company. And the first wave of AI, we're doing some of the work in there. Okay. So, it's a more technology-driven. And we do a lot of technology work. And things like that. But I start yet because I was I played a role as not only a consultant. I was on the bot. So, I got a start understanding on what's happening in the business world. The dynamics of an entrepreneur. So that I got interested in entrepreneurship. Part of it. So, I was doing, And then I come to Stanford I still want to continue doing work at Stanford. So, I start my interest. My interest has shifted. Because of that. From a little bit of economics and go into the business world. That's how I get started. Okay. And in the very beginning my research are more on the system part. Where I was also looking at business as an overall system. Interesting. So, thinking from the system point of view, How the system point of view looking at from the business organization. Right? You're gonna think of system organization really a system. So, that the electrical engineer part of you that's trying to scope business as another. Yes. Yeah. And then I knew that in engineering, the engineer big thing and engineer as well in control. It's feedback. Right? Feedback control is a big thing. But the feedback control is always you try to stabilize the system. But I said, "Well, if you look at the business, you actually don’t want to be stabilizing the system. You want to un-stabilize the system. Because you wanna grow. Right? Grow is not stabilizing. So, what I'm saying that actually in business what you need is not negative feedback. You want positive feedback. So that's the whole concept. Of what Ecom is. So, what is the passive feedback? A positive feedback is something that excites you. And then you have something supporting you. And then you create a exponential growth. That's where from the engineering point of view. And so, you know I'm very curious about this grabber-holder dynamics. Which we've talked about extensively over the past 10 weeks. And I think it's fascinating how it defines so much of also what we're seeing now. You know covid has taken over. And a lot of what I'm seeing now in the way the companies are approaching this. And a lot of the innovations that are coming about. I keep trying to classify them. How are they strategizing and positioning themselves within this grabber-holder dynamics. So, could you give us a slight introduction into what is this dynamic that is not so popular? Right. So, how do you create a positive dynamic? The behavior of course of dynamic from the engineering term is that you are creating eigenvalue was positive, in some way. That is from a mathematical point of view. But how do you translate that into the business point of view. I say it must be something that solve in largely for that. It was something that [--] So, what you wanna do is that your business, you're gonna grab it. You're gonna go excited in a certain way. And then you're gonna find something to hold it. And that's how the grabber-holding come along. And one of the disruption is that there are forces that sort of creating new forces that could kick you in a certain direction. Right? It's a huge force. So, what you can do using a grabber-holder dynamics is you can think of all those forces like whatever. Right? They are actually, they’re pushing you at a certain direction. But it will not stay there. Because when the forces go away, you fall back. But if you're gonna hold it. Then you create a new situation. So, I'm saying for example, you take the covid situation the covid situation actually are are sort of that kick you in a certain so that you shifted your preference. Shift it your way like what is the right way of doing things. And sometimes, it may allow you to create a different kind of a value structure. For example, a lot of people find that because of this covid-19. Right? People actually find new value in family. They revisit the value of family. They revisit the value of community. Right. Which they have lost. You know. They're too busy. They lost it. But then, in order for that to sustain, that means that if you can have something that hold it, then it become, even that the covid-19 is gone, you still have this value let's say sustaining. The question is, What are those thing you need to build up so that you can support it? Right? The way you're saying is that, the way that the grabbing works is sort of like a kick in the stomach. And okay we're shifting the consumer behavior in one way. Whether it's an invention. Or if it's a global pandemic. Exactly. And we've attained this new behavior. We've shifted. The consumers have shifted the mindset, the values, their desires, etc. Now the question is, How do we hold or retain these values? Retain that. Because if you could not retain it, then we'll bounce it back. Right. So, a good case for this would be, well so, Zoom for example enjoyed a lot of this new type of consumer interaction. And a lot of people are wondering. Well now things are starting to open up again. And hopefully soon everything will open up. And are we retaining this consumer behavior? Exactly. or virtual conflict, For example, if Zoom can do something to make you feel that even you're back to normal life, you still find new value in there. And then if I can build certain thing that allows that, that's what I called a holder. And so, the holder is something you build afterwards. After you see what the grabber is pushing you. So, building the holder is more like you know, you do it in time. It's not something that you can foresee. So, you just have to play along. It's more adaptive. It is more, you know you have to build up as you go on. That's the whole concept. Right? So, what are some examples of grabber-holder dynamics that we can see over the past, I don’t know, half a century for example? Well, there's a lot. Almost everything is sort of, like you start to have a grabber and then you start having a holder. I give a few sort of example. Right? You know for example, we're talking about PC, right? PC is a typical grabber-holder dynamic concept. Right? The idea is that I'm gonna have a computer for everybody. So, sounds like a great idea. Okay. And suddenly, in the beginning nobody knows what that does mean. Right? Just, they know what's a computer. Right? They know a little bit about computer. They know the main frame. Just do a lot of calculation. That's too complicated. Too big things. Right? Too many things. Right. And if you ask them what is V-dot and nobody knows. Right? So, in the very beginning, you see what a computer is, it's a little box that can do a calculation. And then some time when you turn off the electricity, everything is gone. Right? That is, oh wow, that's not good. Right? So, it's exciting. I can use that to make calculation. But all the calculation that I make it's all gone. That's were in the very beginning. The first PC doesn’t have a memory. Interesting. Okay. So, what did they do? They attached a recorder. Tape recorder. Like a regular tape recorder attached to a PC. So that you can record [--] But then you have the search rules. It's very complicated. Right? And that's why they get good at least tried, right? That's where I comes in because they see a need that I have to do all the computation or I'm gonna put it. Right? We know that the big computer they can do it. But when you're little box, you say personal computer, I saw small, should I have it or not? Nobody know in the very beginning. So, sort of trial and errors. And you may say that the first success of Apple too is because they attached to it with this drive. Okay. Okay. Was that the whole perspective of it? That's the whole perspective. And you know this. Right? People find you near this right. Well, also you need to have some computation or two. Because it's your computer. You know no one is gonna do write the programming. And at that time, Apple too become successful. It's mainly because, then there were star, And the vesicle comes in. That allow you to do while processing, have a letter and things like that. Vesicle allow you to do simple calculation and accounting. And that's being successful. And that's the holder. Right? Definitely. Okay. So, you have that example and I'd love to talk also about retail. And that specifically I'm interested because that was my-- I give you a very interesting example. Right. yeah. Please. Okay. The other interesting example is Alibaba. Okay. Yeah. Very relevant. Yes. Okay. Now, Alibaba was started of, Alibaba start fooling around in the net. But in the very beginning, they are helping American firm to source a product in China. That's how they do it. Right? It's more like a B2B. Right? They're sourcing. They're helping you. Actually they're not helping you to source. You just go in and find information. Okay, you want a visor and thing. I can tell who are the manufacturer. That's they start in the very beginning. Okay? That means they keep going wrong. Okay. Then Amazon started in the US. And sort of E-commerce has start in the US. And they are successful. An e-commerce and And eBay they all come go to China. And want to do it in China. Then Alibaba say, "Wow. I can do that too." Right? You know, sort of similar thing. And maybe I should also set up something like this. Okay. But on the other hand. One of the things is that, if you want to do e-commerce, Right? So, what is a holder? What is the holder? What is the holder, right? One is that, Why would people want to come to the computer to buy thing? Is that the normal thing that people do? No. The answer is no. Yeah. Maybe some young kids would try. Back then it wasn’t right. Yeah. At that time. Right? Maybe some young kid would try it. Everybody has computer in China. Right. Okay. So, where's the holder? Right? The holder is that you need to have a computer or that somebody need to have that computer. But on the other hand, Also, what you need is that how are you gonna pay? Okay? Right. And the third is that how I trust you. You know, why do I wanna buy it in there? Because if I buy some anything, it's not useful, then what? Right? Yeah. In US, you know this becomes take off for several reason. I think the holder is there. Okay, in the US, how do you solve the problem of payment? Well you can have credit card. You can scan your credit card or whatever. Even there are PayPal, but they start off with credit card. So, people can pay thru credit card. Right. So, I solved the problem of payment. Well, how do I trust it? Well in US they have the consumer protection. US have very high consumer protection. So that if you don't like it, you can return it. Yup. Okay. Then you have to accept the return then. So, that means that in the US the holder is there. Right. Okay? But Professor, it sounds also that from a lot of people-- But in China it's not there Yeah. So, it sounds that in order for a company like eBay or Amazon to become a holder of this new user experience they were helped by, They need to deal with the two problem. Right? And they didn’t deal with them on their own. They had the government and the payment system deal with them for them. Right? They didn’t do this on their own. Because that means that the US all have already the infrastructure. Right. That allow you to do it. And that sometime people can return. But in China, in developing countries sometimes they give a term called Institutional Void. There's some institutional void. And that's exactly what happened in China. There's institutional void in China. The credit card system. There's no credit ranking system. There's more wreck in credit assessment system. So, there's not a lot of credit card [--]. Most of the credit card is [--] in China are all those very famous millionaires. Right? Sure. But young people they will not have one. Right? But all the rich people in China they're not gonna buy thing on themselves. On their own. So then they are not the shopper. So they have the credit card. But they are not the shopper. The shopper are the one who didn’t really have the credit card. So it sounds also when you talk about timing, how timing is important for a startup or for any entrepreneur. Exactly. You have a load of situation over there. Right? So, the other thing is that it is trust problem. Because in China if you buy certain thing, if you don’t like it, you cannot return it. Okay? People will not return it. And they will not accept it. And there's no law to protect you. Okay? So, you cannot sue them or whatever. You cannot do that. So, therefore how do you solve that problem? And this is how Alibaba becomes successful. So, how do they solve it? How do they solve it? Okay. The way they solve it is to say we're build up something called escrow system. Like US they have escrow system. What escrow system is that, you buy certain thing, a certain amount you pay into Alibaba. Alibaba will gonna be the escrow, they gonna hold it. They are not gonna release it to the seller. And then they tell the seller that the buyer have already paid and you can ship it to him. Right. Okay? And they ship it to the buyer. And the buyer have seven days to see, to examine the thing. And within seven days, they can return it to Alibaba. And Alibaba will ship it back to the seller. And return the money back to the buyer. So that means that they are the middle man that keep track on that. Right? That's a lot of logistics to solve the certain problem. There's a lot of logistics to do. right? Not only that. They say no fee. No fee. No fee. So, that means that if you return, doesn’t cost you anything. Interesting. So that obviously is very-- So, an Amazon it's different. Because you actually pay in advance. You already pay for the product. But you have so much trust in the system. That you know you can just return it. Right? Two things. Because in the credit card system, if you don’t like it, you can complain to the credit card and credit card gonna report it. But you know that's interesting. That's already start up in the US. Right? And then you have platform like Upwork, which is for freelancers, where you actually keep the money in escrow, it's all virtual. There’s no tangible services. It's all hypothetical work to be done. Like please put in data. Do a research project for me. Not that I would ever do that for the Stanford of course. But then, once I put the money in escrow, The freelancer can perform the work. And only once I'm satisfied. The money gets released. Which leaves room for negotiation. Because it's so subjective on what are the goods. And you're quality of the goods. That's exactly what's happening. Right? So, that's exactly what Alibaba did. But I think the interesting part what they did is that I charged it free. Then you say, Why are they keeping the money? Here's an interesting part. The seven day where the money is in Alibaba, he would put it into the money market. And earns of interest. And that's how they pay for it. This is in a gray area. Right? Because it's not your money. Right. Yeah? It's not your money. But then if you have a lot of money coming in, then you can become at par. But then they very quickly shift it into set up another thing called an extra money account. That means that I can put money in there and the money would be used for helping you. I would make them interest for you. And they keep a little bit. And anytime you want to buy thing you can use that money. So, they solve the problem very quickly. After a while. So, they use a gray area to move in. Okay? So that's the part they solve that holder. But there's another great holder. It's very important. it's why would people buy thing on the internet? Okay? Now, it turns out that if you look at the timing, it turns out they start taking off in year 2003. Okay. What is the significant of that? In year 2003, SARS appear in China. Like a covid-19. Because of SARS, many place are in lockdown. Especially in Beijing. And then our people still have to buy thing. What do they do? They go to the internet. I love it. Okay? Now, whether without that that will happen or not, I don’t know. Because history didn’t tell us. I mean, I cannot run back the history. But I can say that it has something to do with it because it helped to change people’s preference in buying. o, that's why I'm talking in to you guys that in covid-19, we have a lot of things gonna happen. If you learn from the Alibaba example. That means that the’re new things that gonna open up. If you can see what its leading to. And there's actually, There's another company called JayD. It's actually that company JayD started of is that he is only a, he have a retail store selling electronic equipment in Beijing. And because of SARS, he actually moved that into the internet. That means that there are certainly something that are happening there. JayD is now one of the largest e-commerce in China. It's unbelievable. And Jack Ma's story aside from all that is just so phenomenal by itself. And I think what's really really incredible and very reflective on what we’ve done over these past 10 weeks is that understanding how dynamic this world is. And how is an entrepreneur, You can have an amazing idea with amazing execution. But if you're not dynamic, And if you're not thinking about market forces, and how everything is changing, then you're not setting yourself off for success. And especially today, with things changing so fast. I just heard a podcast that Instacart, the grocery shopping application, they've reached their financial milestone that they predicted for 2024. Now you would think that in 2020 would so many smart people working on this billion-dollar company, they’d be able to predict their sales over years. And it just shows how something happens to the world, markets shift, consumers shift. Who would have guess that they would have had a three-year or four years advancement in just a matter of weeks. I can’t believe our time is almost up and Professor I know you have to go to your next meeting already. But I have to leave with one last question. Three words that you would best describe yourself. Or any of your colleagues at Stanford would describe you as. Well, I don’t know. The hardest question. The hardest questions. I think that, I would like to, my interest, my desire is to, three things right. I feel that entrepreneur is culture dependent. Okay? In different parts of the world. You have a different kind of entrepreneur activity, a different kind of innovation. And so, the innovation are cultural dependent. So, that means that whatever, And each part of the world with culture background they have actually different compatible advantage in deriving certain type of innovation. And so, I believe that people should collaborate. Worldwide collaboration and innovation. I think the past in this part. And the whole idea that innovation is creating value to the world. And so, maybe I would like to describe me as like to promote global innovation to increase the wellbeing, or livelihood of everybody in the world. I love it so much. Professor, thank you so much for your time-- I think I'm more than three words. I'll take because it was just too inspiring. Professor, thank you for the last 10 weeks. Thank you for teaching us all about dynamic entrepreneurial strategy and I look forward to taking more classes with you. Okay. Great. I’ll see you. Take care. Bye.
